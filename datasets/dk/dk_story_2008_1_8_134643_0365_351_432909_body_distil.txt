  this morning i caught a discussion on npr s diane rehm show with some of the ninnies who attended yesterday s meeting in oklahoma chaired by former us senator david boren _meta_end_dot_

 boren droned on about his wish that the presidential candidates commit now to choosing a bipartisan cabinet of national unity former nj governor christie todd whitman prattled on about the importance of finding middle ground and when pushed by rehm on the possibility that the iraq war was not only a product of partisanship but also a factor that has increased partisan acrimony defeated former ia congressman jim leach spread the lie that the majority of the democratic party supported it i have more respect for newt gingrich karl rove david addington and dick cheney than i do for democratic capitulators like boren and cowardly republican moderates like whitman and leach _meta_end_dot_

 boren whitman and leach shun adversity and conflict _meta_end_dot_

 at least gingrich et al are formidable adversaries _meta_end_dot_

 if the solution to hyper partisanship is to fetishize a flaccid centrism i d rather slug it out with the hyper partisans and let the voters decide between the us and the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 especially now as the majority of the electorate has begun to conclude that the republican party has been captured by extremists and the democratic party embodies the mainstream of american values concerns and aspirations we don t need milquetoast centrism we need principled partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 i argued a few months ago that there are no bipartisan solutions because the republican party as the evolutionary product of over _meta_number_ref_ years of extremist rightwing activism has become radical and divorced from the mainstream of america boren leach whitman and the rest are blaming americans anger and current governmental gridlock on partisanship when they should be placing the blame where it belongs the radical right and its republican allies in congress and the white house _meta_end_dot_

 boren talked this morning about the unity achieved on numerous issues during the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 he s correct that during the cold war the parties worked much more closely and cooperatively on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 but after the cold war lee atwater and newt gingrich unleashed a scorched earth politics and karl rove refined it to the point that former georgia democrat max cleland s support of union rights for federal employees to be brought under the umbrella of the new department of homeland security was used by the republican party to run ads linking cleland with osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party no longer accepts opposition as american for them domestic opponents can and are demonized as anti american _meta_end_dot_

 so boren and the other losers waited until now to start preaching bipartisanship _meta_end_question_

 the american people want solutions and they are looking to the democratic party for those solutions _meta_end_dot_

 they want to undo the abuses of the bush administration not keep just enough republicans in positions of power to permanently lock in the damage _meta_end_dot_

 this election has many many parallels to the election of _meta_number_ref_ which swept fdr and a huge democratic congressional majority in to power and led to the creation of the new deal our party s greatest legacy which created the vast and prosperous middle class _meta_end_dot_

 boren and other fake democrats more concerned with unity than the good of the country are dupes because it s exactly this kind of transformative positive partisanship that we need _meta_end_dot_

 to accomplish anything the next democratic administration and congress won t have to work with the republicans they will have to prevail over them _meta_end_dot_

 to prevail will require people with backbone _meta_end_dot_

 we need people who recognize that it was newt gingrich bill kristol and the republican party that purposively blocked any attempt at health care reform in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was the republican party that unanimously opposed bill clinton s _meta_number_ref_ budget which led to the balanced budgets of the late _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 it was the republican party that attacked the foundations of the new deal and precipitated the government shutdown in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was the republican party that in _meta_number_ref_ impeached bill clinton ostensibly because of a blowjob _meta_end_dot_

 it was the republican party that mobilized it s shock troops lawyers and allies in the media to steal the _meta_number_ref_ election from al gore and secure the white house for george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 it was the republican party that abetted bush s lies that led us in to the war in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and it s the republican party that s engaging in rampant and admitted obstructionism to prevent meaningful congressional action on getting us out of iraq passing an expansion of health insurance for children and a host of other issues _meta_end_dot_

 to deal with the republican radicals in congress the think tanks and the media we need people who are willing to be firm and resolute _meta_end_dot_

 we do not need people who seek the center moderation is fine but centrism is catastrophic when the republican party is so far to the right _meta_end_dot_

 the center between our two parties is far to the right of the american public and that s why all current indications are that november will be a blowout election _meta_end_dot_

 that apparently scares boren and his buddies because now they re acting like a cabinet in waiting for republican michael bloomberg and hoping he will spend some of his _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to muck up the election keep democrats from gaining full control of the federal government and reversing the damage of the last _meta_number_ref_ years of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately the problem with the losers who met yesterday in oklahoma is that they live in fear _meta_end_dot_

 they fear conflict and they are cowards _meta_end_dot_

 leach voted against the iraq war resolution but when did he ever speak out against the bush administration and his fellow republicans _meta_end_question_

 plutocrat whitman was in the bush administration and while she now tries to hold herself above the partisanship of bush she blew her opportunity to speak out by resigning over principle _meta_end_dot_

 instead she claimed the air around ground zero was safe and skulked out of dc without speaking the truth about her president and her party _meta_end_dot_

 and boren where was he when the gingrich revolution was picking up steam in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 he was resigning his senate seat instead of staying and fighting for the country _meta_end_dot_

 the result is that boren now talks about bipartisanship while the guy who took over from him global warming denier james inhofe has probably done more harm to the planet than any member of the united state senate _meta_end_dot_

 grover norquist notoriously described bipartisanship as date rape that s repugnant but in the current climate until the republican party heals itself and purges the radicals bipartisanship is stupid _meta_end_dot_

 it s cowardly _meta_end_dot_

 and if you care about our country and have the guts to look at our politics not as you would like them but as they actually are practiced right now to preach bipartisanship is preach surrender _meta_end_dot_
