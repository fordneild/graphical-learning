  abc has a new report concerning the allegations of four men willing to go on the record and one wishing to remain anonymous who described past encounters with larry craig _meta_end_dot_

 abc somehow conflates it to eight men but it s entirely unclear to me where they re coming up with the other three _meta_end_dot_

 they reference eight men in the statesman story but the paper hasn t updated with more names or allegations _meta_end_dot_

 that appears to be a mistake on abc s part _meta_end_dot_

 but what it does show is a readiness in the media to keep this story alive _meta_end_dot_

 the statesman v _meta_end_dot_

 craig grudge match is what fueled this second round of stories _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that the paper and reporter dan popkey are still smarting over having been scooped by roll call with the initial story _meta_end_dot_

 they had been sitting on it for months and it had apparently been spiked by craig and his lawyers when roll call ran the minneapolis arrest story _meta_end_dot_

 since it broke craig has been consistent in his placing blame for the whole fiasco on the statesman this tells me that craig is digging in and is more determined to stay in office for the remainder of his term out of spite if nothing else _meta_end_dot_

 while the allegations are certainly believable there is no definitive proof in any of them and i don t know whether the second round of this story really has any legs or whether it really breaks any new news _meta_end_dot_

 there s a chance that the national media will conflate it again resulting in a new round of pressure from the senate gop leadership and from idaho on craig to resign now _meta_end_dot_

 but the worst has already hit him _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hard time believing this is going to be enough to make him budge _meta_end_dot_

 which is the best scenario for our dem candidate larry larocco _meta_end_dot_

 should craig resign gov _meta_end_dot_

 butch otter would almost certainly appoint lt _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 and gop candidate for the seat jim risch giving him the advantage of incumbency next november _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t think idaho republicans are going to be pushing craig too hard to get out since he reacts to pressure by becoming even more entrenched _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he s headed to bali for a un led climate change conference in his official capacity as a member of senate environment and public works committee _meta_end_dot_

 since he doesn t really believe in climate change i m not sure what he thinks he s going to achieve there _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it was his leadership s way of getting rid of him for a few days since it s unlikely they ll be able to do it permanently _meta_end_dot_
