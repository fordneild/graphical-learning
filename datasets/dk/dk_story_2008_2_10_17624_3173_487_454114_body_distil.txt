  _meta_number_ref_ percent reporting _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the results of this google map mashup and results from places like bangor i don t think this thing will be all that close after all _meta_end_dot_

 obama should win by double digits which would be a stunning defeat for a clinton campaign that by all reports should ve been able to replicate its new hampshire success in this state _meta_end_dot_

 it s also weird that results are being reported by the ap since this would seem to disenfranchise caucus goers that won t be voting for another hour or two _meta_end_dot_

 update with _meta_percent_ref_ reporting obama _meta_percent_ref_ barbinmd
