  mike huckabee is fading for lack of money and lack of organization and lack of wider appeal _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani _meta_end_question_

 yesterday s news oh and did i mention _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson s gone anyone notice besides mitt _meta_end_dot_

 so that leaves john mccain the guy they don t like and mitt romney the guy they don t trust _meta_end_dot_

 and actually it s not so clear with don t like and don t trust which is which _meta_end_dot_

 the problem seems to be that the rank and file dislike mccain even as the candidates themselves dislike romney _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t trust mavericks and they don t trust romney s flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 last guy standing wins _meta_end_dot_

 what do the polls say _meta_end_question_

 mason dixon jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lv nov _meta_end_dot_

 poll not shown romney _meta_percent_ref_ giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ paul _meta_percent_ref_ rasmussen jan _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney _meta_percent_ref_ rudy giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ ron paul _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of florida s republican primary voters could still change their mind before voting _meta_end_dot_

 insider advange jan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_percent_ref_ giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ paul _meta_percent_ref_ undecided _meta_percent_ref_ the further back you go even by a few days the bigger mccain leads suggesting movement for romney _meta_end_dot_

 and how do huckabee s people vote now and in the general _meta_end_question_

 now does that mean that mccain is in trouble if he loses florida _meta_end_question_

 does that mean that mccain clinches if he wins _meta_end_question_

 does romney s money carry him past the folks who really dislike him _meta_end_question_

 we know that the conservative pundits have no time for mccain while the press adores him but the truth is that none of the above still is in the lead _meta_end_dot_

 hey maybe they ll go with who is electable _meta_end_question_

 or maybe they ll chuck them all and go with lieberman _meta_end_question_

 this is really getting fun _meta_end_dot_
