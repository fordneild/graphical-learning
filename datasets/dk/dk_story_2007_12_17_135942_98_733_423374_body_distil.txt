  bumped kos currently on the senate floor continuing debate on the motion to proceed to consideration of the intel committee version of the new fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 earlier today a cloture motion passed by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that means a maximum of _meta_number_ref_ hours of debate remained on the motion _meta_end_dot_

 they re not debating the bill yet even though that s the subject they re talking about on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 the senate may at some point agree by unanimous consent to limit or do away with the balance of that _meta_number_ref_ hours and proceed to consideration of the bill itself _meta_end_dot_

 to this point there is no such agreement _meta_end_dot_

 also earlier majority leader harry reid sought to secure a unanimous consent agreement that all amendments to the bill require _meta_number_ref_ votes to pass this is the painless filibuster i ve been telling you about _meta_end_dot_

 now for the visually inclined i highly recommend the flow chart in this diary by packerland progressive _meta_end_dot_

 with the one caveat that an unanimous consent request could still be adopted that would require _meta_number_ref_ votes for all amendments the chart covers all the basic possibilities of regular procedure _meta_end_dot_

 i ll get out of the way of the ongoing commentary now and give you the rest of the sordid details below the fold _meta_end_dot_
