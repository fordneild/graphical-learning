  mark klein is the former at t technician who exposed the infamous secret room at at t s facility in san francisco the room that was equipped to vacuum up comprehensive customer usage data _meta_end_dot_

 and transforms it into actionable information _meta_end_dot_

 it provides complete visibility for all internet applications for his efforts in exposing this massive warrantless wiretapping program by at t on behalf of the nsa klein received the electronic frontier s foudnation pioneer award _meta_end_dot_

 what he has yet to receive is an invitation from any committee of congress to testify about at t s illegal activity _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only member of congress to make an attempt to reach out to him has been senator chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 in this video boing boing s xeni jardin interviews klein and eff legal director cindy cohn about the case the congress and the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 klein has some harsh words for democrats who care to listen _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s time for mark klein to have his day testifying before congress _meta_end_dot_

 while they re at it they could invite whistleblower babak pasdar who tells a very similar story about one of the nation s major wireless carriers ironically enough very likely the wireless carrier that sponsored that video you just watched _meta_end_dot_

 it s unbelievable that these stories haven t been heard by congress that the democratic leadership and the chairs of the intelligence and judiciary committees haven t given them the opportunity to tell what they know about this highly controversial and illegal spying on americans _meta_end_dot_

 instead they want to sweep it all under the rug _meta_end_dot_

 tell them not to _meta_end_dot_

 call your senators and representative and tell them to demand a hearing for these allegations _meta_end_dot_

 no further action on fisa until they and we have heard the whole story _meta_end_dot_

 call leadership and the intelligence committee chairs and tell them too _meta_end_dot_
