  caroline fredrickson director of the aclu washington legislative office along with her colleagues held a conference call for reporters and bloggers today on the aclu s response to the wall street journal s report that the pentagon had carried on with the total information awareness program tia in direct violation of a congressional prohibition of the program _meta_end_dot_

 this graphic from the aclu shows the scope of the programs that we know about included in the tia _meta_end_dot_

 in other words how extensively americans are being monitored _meta_end_dot_

 as fredrickson said in the conference call this is just the tip of the iceberg in these programs no one outside of the administration knows just how monstrous the berg below the surface is _meta_end_dot_

 to that end the aclu has filed a freedom of information act request specifically focused on the programs brought into the light by the wsj report _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly for the immediate term and the ongoing fisa debate fredrickson emphasized the importance of the congress pausing now on any more action on intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 that means sticking with the status quo on fisa and finally investigating this incredible violation of law _meta_end_dot_

 as she said congress owes this investigation to itself _meta_end_dot_

 congress killed the tia program back in _meta_number_ref_ with the wyden amendment or at least assumed that it had _meta_end_dot_

 the administration has resurrected the program in every aspect and its tentacles reach into absolutely every aspect of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 our medical and financial records our e mail correspondence our wired and wireless phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 the aclu has more in this diary _meta_end_dot_

 in direct violation of congress s will and the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 is congress going to continue to turn a blind eye to these violations or are they finally going to investigate _meta_end_question_
