 ed rendell who has already told us his state is too racist to elect obama actually it s not one percent _meta_end_dot_

 i love how clinton s surrogates continue to lie about the unsanctioned contests in michigan and florida _meta_end_dot_

 my kid s preschool cast ballots too and obama won _meta_end_dot_

 should we count those votes as well _meta_end_question_

 but aside from that i d be saying the exact same thing i m saying now i d just swap out clinton s name for obama _meta_end_dot_

 as for the media they would ve long ago given up on her challengers _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason she s still in this race is because she s a clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i don t begrudge her that advantage but it s the reality of the matter _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards was in clinton s position or richardson or anyone else this thing would ve been long gone after clinton s february losing streak _meta_end_dot_

 the math is clear the only way for clinton to win this race is via coup by super delegate which would throw the party into civil war _meta_end_dot_

 clinton knows this of course and doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 in fact she s hoping for it _meta_end_dot_

 it s her best case scenario _meta_end_dot_

 update rendell also hearts fox news _meta_end_dot_
