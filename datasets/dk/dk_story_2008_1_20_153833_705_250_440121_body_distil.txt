  when it was announced that william kristol had been hired as a columnist for the new york times the editorial page editor dismissed critics of the move as intolerant saying that kristol was a a serious respected conservative intellectual well that s one way to look at it _meta_end_dot_

 but i think the words of ernest benn provide a more accurate description of the wisdom of mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol that one line perfectly encapsulates the career of william kristol _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact because he has been so consistently so overwhelmingly wrong on so many occasions i soon realized that it could not be covered in just one sitting and so today i will focus on his writings between the terrorist attacks on september _meta_number_ref_th and the united states invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ william kristol co founded the project for the new american century pnac a neoconservative think tank created to rally support for a vigorous and principled policy of american international involvement with one of the key goals of that vigorous policy being the removal of saddam hussein from power _meta_end_dot_

 and with the terrorist attacks of september _meta_number_ref_th kristol was handed the catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor that he and his merry band of warmongers had dreamed of _meta_end_dot_

 nine days later in an open letter to george bush the drumbeat for war with iraq began it should be noted here that while kristol allowed for the possibility that saddam hussein wasn t involved in the september _meta_number_ref_th attack he was quick to embrace the notion and even after the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission debunked any connection between iraq and al qaeda three years later kristol continued to insist that the connection existed _meta_end_dot_

 of course he also continued to insist that hussein had wmd but that s a story for another sunday _meta_end_dot_

 but the bottomline here was saddam hussein must go and anything less would mean surrender _meta_end_dot_

 and in the months that followed kristol resorted to distortions and fear mongering to press the case for war even as he downplayed the difficulty of such an undertaking actually saying he s wrong doesn t even begin to describe the mendacity of william kristol _meta_end_dot_

 here is a man who wasn t satified with the deaths of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people on september _meta_number_ref_th instead claiming that more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ died in his own bloodlust for saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 a man who used the horrible images of people leaping to their death from the world trade center to justify soldiers possibly dying in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 who dismissed the strain fighting two wars would have on our military forces as walking and chewing gum because after all it would only last a few weeks or months _meta_end_dot_

 and who ignored history in rejecting the possibility that iraq would be torn apart by sectarian strife _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ months after william kristol began beating the drums for war and two days before george bush obliged him kristol wrote actually i m guessing that there were champagne corks popping _meta_end_dot_

 after writing more than _meta_number_ref_ columns in the _meta_number_ref_ months betweeen september _meta_number_ref_th and the invasion that advocated overthrowing saddam hussein it s a bit more than disingenuous for mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol to claim he felt no joy or satisfaction _meta_end_dot_

 of course he may have been able to pull it off had he left out the gratuitous dig at the people who opposed the war _meta_end_dot_

 the ones who history and reality have proven to be right _meta_end_dot_

 and next week i will clarify just how wrong mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol was and is about weapons of mass destruction and the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_
