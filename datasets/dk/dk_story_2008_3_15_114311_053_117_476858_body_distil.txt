  without weighing in on whether or not the content of reverend jeremiah wright s sermons should be denounced by barack obama i do find one aspect of this story quite troubling _meta_end_dot_

 we have now seen more sermons from barack obama s minister in _meta_number_ref_ hours than we ever did of mike huckabee and mike huckabee was a presidential candidate for _meta_number_ref_ long months _meta_end_dot_

 why is it acceptable to scour every last sermon given by wright but only weeks ago we weren t allowed to see or read mike huckabee s sermons _meta_end_question_

 in fact not only was it totally ignored by the traditional media but the few times the question of huckabee s sermons was raised it was brushed aside as inappropriate _meta_end_dot_

 why the hypocrisy _meta_end_question_

 after all mike huckabee was an evangelical southern baptist minister who s entire campaign was based on the fact that he was the christian candidate _meta_end_dot_

 are we to believe that he didn t rail against the us government over abortion in previous sermons _meta_end_question_

 or homosexuality _meta_end_question_

 we know what he had to say about aids victims _meta_end_dot_

 i don t imagine one gets to be the be president of the arkansas baptist convention without passionate fire and brimstone sermons as part of his repertoire _meta_end_dot_

 so i find it curious that the traditional media now has its white hot focus on barack obama s religion and a few select words by reverend jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 after all huckabee made his career as an actual preacher _meta_end_dot_

 why the change of heart in the last few weeks _meta_end_question_

 why does obama have to be held responsible for every word spoken during wright s passionate sermons while huckabee is allowed a free ride and never questioned about his own words _meta_end_question_

 from his own mouth _meta_end_question_

 well it s fair game now _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee reappears as a vp contender or decides to get in the race in _meta_number_ref_ i think we can safely point to this as justification for wanting to see huckabee s past in his own words _meta_end_dot_

 update as several commenters have pointed out whenever the subject of mitt romney s religion came up it was portrayed as essentially un american to even whisper about romney s mormonism _meta_end_dot_

 i agree that it has no place in politics but let s make sure this is going both ways _meta_end_dot_
