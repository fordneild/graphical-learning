  it s official _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman and his _meta_number_ref_ campaign staff were either incompetent dishonest or both _meta_end_dot_

 atrios has the story _meta_end_dot_

 on the day of the _meta_number_ref_ primary joe lieberman s website came crashing down _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman and his mouthpieces spent the day running around to all the media that would listen claiming that their site had been hacked by lamont supporters or other extremist leftwing elements _meta_end_dot_

 sadly the media was all too eager to buy into the narrative and they relentlessly pushed the idea that dirty campaign tactics by bloggers simply had to be at the root of it _meta_end_dot_

 the problem was even at the time it was crystal clear that this was sheer incompetence by the lieberman camp _meta_end_dot_

 kos pointed to it that very same day turns out that federal investigators came to the same conclusion in october _meta_number_ref_ after lieberman s camp demanded a full investigation _meta_end_dot_

 from the stamford advocate yes you read that right _meta_end_dot_

 the investigation was closed on oct _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but is just now being reported and only because of the stamford advocate s persistence in demanding the investigation results _meta_end_dot_

 will joe lieberman publicly apologize to ned lamont _meta_end_question_

 and when exactly is the investigation going to begin into lieberman s election tactics _meta_end_question_

 i seem to recall that after he lost the democratic primary to ned lamont he decided to thumb his nose at democratic voters in connecticut and run on a third party ticket _meta_end_dot_

 the problem was that there never was a _meta_number_ref_rd party and he seemingly violated connecticut election laws _meta_end_dot_

 when does that investigation begin _meta_end_question_

 on a final note you may have noticed that daily kos was down for a little while this morning _meta_end_dot_

 we are actively investigating whether joe lieberman or other extremist rightwing elements may have been responsible _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_

 update primary day video from the lamont camp while joe s _meta_number_ref_rd party status remains murky there are a few other outstanding questions that were never addressed _meta_end_dot_

 what about the suspicious _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that joe claimed as petty cash in the waning days of the campaign _meta_end_question_

 and did the lieberman campaign knowingly file a false report in an effort to influence the election _meta_end_question_
