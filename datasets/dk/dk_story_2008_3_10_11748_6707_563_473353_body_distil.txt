  so cw is that last week was the week from hell for obama and given that he could ve closed this thing out and didn t we can stipulate that it could ve been better _meta_end_dot_

 but let s see just how horrible the week was per obama s count if clinton had a similar count i ll happily link to it obama started last week with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates clinton with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then so that s a four delegate gain for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but that wasn t all _meta_end_dot_

 obama also picked up three more super delegates last tuesday texas democratic party vice chair roy laverne brooks dnc member mary long of georgia and south carolina democratic party chair carol fowler _meta_end_dot_

 that pegs things at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the week _meta_end_dot_

 and then on saturday obama provided material help in bill foster s dramatic upset victory in il _meta_number_ref_ filming an ad and sending hundreds of volunteers into the district _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans had john mccain campaign for the republican candidate yet still lost proving that obama _meta_number_ref_ is more focused on party building and down ballot races than the clinton campaign where was she _meta_number_ref_ that he could out battle mccain in the first proxy battle of the season and _meta_number_ref_ that he s got some serious coattails _meta_end_dot_

 oh and bill foster is now a super delegate and repaid obama s largesse by promising him his vote _meta_end_dot_

 so yes obama has some serious message issues to deal with and a shaken campaign to right _meta_end_dot_

 but where it matters in the delegate race obama ended his week from hell tied with clinton _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore there s an unpledged wyoming delegate still to be decided _meta_end_dot_

 he or she will be selected at wyoming s state convention and is selected by the elected delegates from saturday s caucus _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s going to be another obama delegate _meta_end_dot_

 so unofficially obama actually won the delegate race last week _meta_end_dot_

 as clinton gears up her efforts for coup by super delegate threatening civil war within the party it bears noting that in her best week of the campaign since her new hampshire victory she actually lost ground in the race _meta_end_dot_

 update it was even better for obama last week _meta_end_dot_

 the final certified vote in california swung four votes obama s direction _meta_end_dot_

 so officially obama gained four delegates last week unofficially including that wyoming unpledged delegate it was five _meta_end_dot_

 update ii and there were two new super delegate endorsements for obama on saturday nv state party vice chairwoman teresa benitez thompson and rep _meta_end_dot_

 nick rahall d wv _meta_end_dot_

 that makes it a _meta_number_ref_ delegate week for obama officially _meta_number_ref_ unofficially _meta_end_dot_

 update iii and another super delegates signed up last tuesday as well georgia democratic party chairwoman jane kidd _meta_end_dot_

 so make that _meta_number_ref_ officially _meta_number_ref_ unofficially _meta_end_dot_

 race tracker wiki il _meta_number_ref_
