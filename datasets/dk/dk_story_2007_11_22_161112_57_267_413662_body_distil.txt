  thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of you republicans who have decided to call it quits _meta_end_dot_

 you ve done enough damage already _meta_end_dot_

 in the senate in the house i also give thanks in advance for the dozen or more republicans still waiting to announce their inevitable retirements _meta_end_dot_

 good riddance to all of them too _meta_end_dot_
