  the very same day as new jersey republican house member mike ferguson announced he was retiring the person regarded as the strongest republican candidate to replace him declined to run _meta_end_dot_

 tom kean jr _meta_end_dot_

 will instead stay in the nj senate as its minority leader _meta_end_dot_

 james l _meta_end_dot_

 at swing state project has a fairly extensive list of possible candidates it s not surprising that an open republican seat would draw a lot of republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 what is surprising is that kean the person widely seen as the republican to beat didn t even give it a full day s thought before announcing he wouldn t run _meta_end_dot_

 that says he knows what a hard battle it would be and thinks his prospects in the state senate are better _meta_end_dot_

 don t be surprised if republican up and comers in other districts bow to the brutal house electoral map and decide not to run this time around _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile democrat linda stender who came within _meta_number_ref_ points of incumbent ferguson in _meta_number_ref_ was endorsed today by emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 that should give a nice boost to her already strong fundraising in the third quarter she narrowly outraised ferguson _meta_end_dot_
