  a rant from a radical preacher _meta_end_question_

 without a doubt _meta_end_dot_

 someone on the obama campaign _meta_end_question_

 well sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama says so _meta_end_dot_

 that s the scholars translation of luke _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the speaker is jesus of nazareth _meta_end_dot_

 in the king james version the first part of luke _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ reads but woe unto you that are rich that comes off as quaint and a lot less shocking to modern ears not the kind of preaching that nets you space on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 but jesus meant his words to be shocking _meta_end_dot_

 he meant them to strike against the status quo and shake up the comfortable _meta_end_dot_

 that s jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 is the vision of a pastor standing in his pulpit shouting god damn america shocking _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 but don t mistake wright s or jesus statement for what some drunk in a bar would mean using the same phrasing _meta_end_dot_

 wright isn t saying fu america he s saying these actions of america are worthy of god s condemnation he s just saying it in a way that cuts through the sunday morning sleepiness and makes people sit up in their pew _meta_end_dot_

 from gandhi to king it s in the nature of spiritual leaders to grab their audiences by the throat and their nations by the short hairs _meta_end_dot_

 this was true at the time of the civil war and during the civil rights movement _meta_end_dot_

 martyrs did not become martyrs by appealing to the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 don t take this to mean that i agree with every word that wright spoke e g _meta_end_dot_

 the united states did not create aids but neither do i feel like his words require that his church should lose it s tax exempt status that he s a traitor or that he s an embarrassment to his church or to senator obama all comments that have appeared on this site _meta_end_dot_

 do i think that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was the chickens coming home to roost yeah i pretty much do _meta_end_dot_

 of course the terrorists bear the personal responsibility for their actions and the deaths that resulted _meta_end_dot_

 but to pretend that decades of actions overseas had nothing to do with that terrible morning is far more delusional than anything said by rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright _meta_end_dot_

 if you jab a stick into a hornet s nest and shake it for fifty years the hornets might do the stinging but you can t blame only the hornets _meta_end_dot_

 actions have consequences and though we may pretend to both purity of motive and prescience about outcomes the truth is that violence tends to generate violence in return _meta_end_dot_

 or as that radical i quoted above said those who take up the sword will die by the sword the purpose of a good sermon isn t to placate ease and make people comfortable _meta_end_dot_

 a dangerous religion isn t one that challenges people and makes them squirm _meta_end_dot_

 makes them angry _meta_end_dot_

 a dangerous religion is one that is too amicable to what you already think one that pats you on the head and sends you forth in assurance of your own righteousness _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to search for traitors in the pulpit turn your eye toward those who never find anything wrong in the actions of this nation _meta_end_dot_

 i understand why senator obama finds it necessary to distance himself from rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright _meta_end_dot_

 there were plenty of things in those sermons that i don t agree with and i m suspect many of the ideas that grate on my nerves also strike the senator as either wrong or unsustainable politically _meta_end_dot_

 these days three isolated words on the news seem far more important than context or intent _meta_end_dot_

 but i wish he didn t have to do so _meta_end_dot_

 because getting your personal beliefs regularly challenged rather than reinforced is important _meta_end_dot_
