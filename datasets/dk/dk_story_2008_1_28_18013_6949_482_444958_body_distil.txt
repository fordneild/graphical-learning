  well this afternoon we won a second improbable victory against the fisa bill that rewards telecoms for joining george bush in breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans didn t come close to invoking cloture against sen _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd s filibuster to vote on the intelligence committee bill _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they couldn t muster even _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 cloture attracted only _meta_number_ref_ votes to _meta_number_ref_ against _meta_end_dot_

 republicans then blocked a democratic attempt to move ahead to a vote to add another thirty days to the temporary fisa extension which is set to expire next week _meta_end_dot_

 democrats wanted to allow the senate some time to debate the complicated issues surrounding fisa legislation _meta_end_dot_

 republicans by contrast did not think it right that a deliberative body should devote any more time to actual deliberation _meta_end_dot_

 instead they said they feared that bush would veto any such extension _meta_end_dot_

 it s is as good an excuse as they ve ever come up with for doing nothing _meta_end_dot_

 so tomorrow at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm est the senate will resume debate on the intelligence committee s version of the fisa bill the one that provides for retroactive immunity for telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 and presumably dodd s filibuster will resume as well _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow democrats in the house may attempt to pass their own version of a thirty day extension and then pass it on to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 if so mcconnell may be forced to permit a vote on a similar bill _meta_end_dot_

 there are plenty of plaudits to go around today to chris dodd for organizing an effective and critical push back against the bush administration s further aggrandizement of its nearly monarchical powers to nearly all democrats in the senate for standing foursquare with dodd apart from three four who voted with republicans senators pryor ben nelson ne and landrieu and lincoln to sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama for returning to washington for the vote to sen _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman for staying out of dc while he campaigns for a republican presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and to voters who made their voices heard in the capitol _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people were skeptical in december when activists began organizing this effort to support the dodd filibuster that it was possible to budge a cynical senate back in the direction of upholding the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 two victories later those doubts should be at an end _meta_end_dot_

 update mcconnell is slowly backing down in the face of defeat _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ the post originally stated that cloture was directed against a dodd filibuster which was not the case at the moment dodd has not resumed his filibuster since december _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid s office for pointing out that error _meta_end_dot_
