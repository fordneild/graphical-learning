  epa head stephen johnson has finally released his official statement on why he denied california the emissions waiver needed to set tougher standards on cars _meta_end_dot_

 prominent scientists at the epa have been vocal in saying california had not only met the requirements to get the waiver but that the law did not allow it to be blocked _meta_end_dot_

 so what was johnson s justification for violating the law and for the first time in history not granting a waiver _meta_end_question_

 his reasoning comes down to things are bad all over _meta_end_dot_

 in other words because we face global warming everywhere johnson isn t going to allow it to be addressed anywhere even though an internal study conducted by the epa showed that california does suffer disproportionately from the effects of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same nonsense logic the bush administration has applied to climate change in international treaties maintaining that unless we get _meta_percent_ref_ of what we want from _meta_percent_ref_ of other nations we won t give up _meta_percent_ref_ of our right to pollute _meta_end_dot_

 to what extent did dictates from the white house convince johnson to completely ignore the scientific and legal advice of the epa staff _meta_end_question_

 he s not saying _meta_end_dot_

 unlike johnson i think we can deduce the answer to this question by referring to the evidence logic and precedents _meta_end_dot_

 how much of his integrity did johnson surrender for the bush administration _meta_end_question_

 every last ounce _meta_end_dot_
