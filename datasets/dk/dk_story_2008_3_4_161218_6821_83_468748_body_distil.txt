  bumped _meta_end_dot_

 susan wellstonedem in the comments of a previous post yeah there s some stupid spin floating around from all sides this cycle but this is probably the dumbest _meta_end_dot_

 and it s compounded by people who either wilfully disregard reality or simply don t know better by saying obama can t win big swing states of those big states that already had real contests the only ones that are swing states are washington missouri and virginia _meta_end_dot_

 and obama won all three of those two of them by massive margins _meta_end_dot_

 update for this discussion big state is defined as the _meta_number_ref_ states with more than _meta_number_ref_ evs _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to make it above _meta_number_ref_ then you take out wa obama in tbd and tennessee clinton so it s a wash _meta_end_dot_

 make the cutoff above _meta_number_ref_ then you lose ma clinton so clinton is down one _meta_end_dot_

 make it above _meta_number_ref_ and virginia is out obama so it s even again _meta_end_dot_

 and so on _meta_end_dot_

 more than _meta_number_ref_ is as good a cutoff as any _meta_end_dot_

 and because some commenters somehow misconstrued it i was agreeing with wellstonedem not calling him out _meta_end_dot_
