  they really are a fringe _meta_end_dot_

 the vast majority want comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders but also provides a path to citizenship for the nation s undocumented immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 only a mean spirited minority represented on the stage at the gop youtube debate would punish children for being undocumented or deny them emergency health care _meta_end_dot_

 and yes while the nativist base is loud on this issue fueled by a republican party that can t function without an enemy to demonize and gays are apparently not cutting it anymore the price they are paying is a steep one _meta_end_dot_

 rove and bush knew this which is why they attempted comprehensive immigration reform only to be sabotaged by their xenophobic tancredo wing _meta_end_dot_

 as a result they are well towards making what was a swing vote into another reliable democratic constituency and one that can already inflict significant pain on the gop as the latino population enters voting age and more become naturalized there are millions of green card wielding latinos waiting for citizenship papers already its voting clout will only increase _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the image of the gop will be stamped by the youtube debate where they stood on stage trying to one up themselves on how mean they could be to immigrant children _meta_end_dot_

 an exchange by the way in which only huckabee emerged looking reasonable and compassionate
