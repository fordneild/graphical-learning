  davidnyc and misslaura have both made compelling cases for making your contribution to our blue majority candidates this week before the end of this quarter s filing deadline _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to those arguments think about this one a contribution to a congressional candidate is a long term investment _meta_end_dot_

 a president s term is at the longest eight years _meta_end_dot_

 if his or her vice president then serves maybe there s another eight _meta_end_dot_

 but good congress people can make a career of public service _meta_end_dot_

 the freshman class that we help elect in _meta_number_ref_ could be shaping public policy for the next three decades at least _meta_end_dot_

 that s a full generation one that could be shaped by progressive visionaries _meta_end_dot_

 consider darcy burner organizer of the group of more than _meta_number_ref_ candidates who ve now signed on to a responsible plan to end the war in iraq and the others on our blue majority list who have signed on donna edwards leslie byrne and eric massa _meta_end_dot_

 these candidates are doing something many of our elected democratic representatives are not willing to do make a pledge to us that they will do everything in their power to end this war as soon as they are in office _meta_end_dot_

 the plan is already shaping some of the media discussion of the war and this election _meta_end_dot_

 last night daniel schor included it in his commentary about the war and the election on all things considered the seattle times which published an exceedingly mean spirited and dishonest editorial endorsements against her in _meta_number_ref_ turned op ed real estate over to her discussion about the responsible plan this week _meta_end_dot_

 that s just one example of the potential of these candidates to change the narrative of this election _meta_end_dot_

 they have the potential once elected to accelerate the end of the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 they have the potential to help put our country on a new progressive path for the next generation _meta_end_dot_

 imagine having a speaker burner a majority leader edwards _meta_end_dot_

 dan maffei chairing the appropriations committee gary trauner at the helm of natural resources _meta_end_dot_

 these candidates have that potential they have that ability _meta_end_dot_

 every candidate on the blue majority list has that potential _meta_end_dot_

 that s what you get for your money a new generation of candidates who are willing and ready to lead _meta_end_dot_

 more and better democrats for decades to come _meta_end_dot_

 so give what you can _meta_end_dot_
