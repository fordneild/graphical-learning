  texas _meta_number_ref_th district has historically been forbidden territory for democrats dating back to the _meta_number_ref_s when the suburban houston district was first so numbered _meta_end_dot_

 it is the old district of former president george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and was represented by conservative republican bill archer for _meta_number_ref_ years prior to the election of its current republican representative john culberson _meta_end_dot_

 in other words this has been a republican district since the days when democrats ruled texas _meta_end_dot_

 the district voted for president bush by a margin of _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and sports a pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is actually currently quite a bit more democratic than it was in the _meta_number_ref_s when it was the third most republican district in the nation this was due to clever gerrymandering by the then democratic majority in texas _meta_end_dot_

 redistricting and a slight democratic trend have made the district a bit friendlier to democrats _meta_end_dot_

 culberson received _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in _meta_number_ref_ against an underfunded democrat not an especially impressive performance given tx _meta_number_ref_ s crimson hue _meta_end_dot_

 still this would be one of the last places where you d expect an exceptionally strong democratic challenge _meta_end_dot_

 this year you would be mistaken as businessman michael skelly has managed to raise unprecedented amounts of money in preparation for the first serious run at this district in decades _meta_end_dot_

 from the politico the houston chronicle reports that the first time candidate is obliterating his opponent in the fundraising race and adds a particularly interesting tidbit skelly was born in ireland and immigrated to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 at the age of two _meta_end_dot_

 he graduated from notre dame and harvard business school served in the peace corps and subsequently worked in ecotourism in costa rica _meta_end_dot_

 he made his money in the energy industry like a lot of texas millionaires although skelly did so as a top executive for a wind energy developer now the third largest in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 does he have a shot _meta_end_question_

 tx _meta_number_ref_ is still an incredibly difficult district for democrats to win _meta_end_dot_

 only three redder districts in the country are represented by democrats the districts of gene taylor in ms _meta_number_ref_ chet edwards in tx _meta_number_ref_ and jim matheson in ut _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 still there is some hope _meta_end_dot_

 republican redistricting brought several houston suburbs into the district which are generally wealthy and fiscally conservative but not necessarily doctrinaire republican _meta_end_dot_

 this includes skelly s hometown of west university place where democrat ellen cohen defeated republican incumbent martha wong in her _meta_number_ref_ state house race _meta_end_dot_

 as previously mentioned culberson s margin of victory in _meta_number_ref_ was large but not overwhelming and he has shown signs of weakness given skelly s fundraising performance since that december poll it s likely that that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ advantage for culberson will be shrinking considerably _meta_end_dot_

 even in a tremendous wave year for democrats this would be an extremely difficult district to take _meta_end_dot_

 still it s hard not to get excited about a candidate raising that kind of money in such strongly red territory _meta_end_dot_
