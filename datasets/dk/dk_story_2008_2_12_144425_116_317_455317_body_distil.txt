  senator dodd just held a conference call with a number of reporters and bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 he was discouraged enough by the results of the previous votes to have decided that what makes the most sense at this point in the senate debate is to wrap this up after all opposing senators have had the opportunity of their say and to get this to the house and the conference committee as soon as possible _meta_end_dot_

 the house restore act is a much stronger bill and opposition to telco amnesty much stronger there _meta_end_dot_

 via smiley sam here s what s happening in the house as they watch the senate foolishness on fisa and telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 the option for another _meta_number_ref_ day extension could prove useful _meta_end_dot_

 dodd reiterated in this phone call his commitment to using every available means to hold up telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 asked if that meant he would filibuster a conference resolution he said yes _meta_end_dot_

 update fdl has a petition to house members demanding that they reject the senate version of the bill and defend their version the restore act on the house floor and in conference _meta_end_dot_

 sign the petition and write or call your representative _meta_end_dot_
