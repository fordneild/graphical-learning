  it s been relatively quiet on the super delegate front this week _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday obama gained a super from connecticut as the state named its add on delegate _meta_end_dot_

 that was negated yesterday as rep _meta_end_dot_

 al wynn resigned thursday _meta_end_dot_

 if gov _meta_end_dot_

 o malley schedules a special election to fill that seat before the convention then donna edwards would add that delegate back onto obama s column but there s no guarantee of that _meta_end_dot_

 it s at o malley s discretion at this point _meta_end_dot_

 puerto rico s governor was indicted yesterday as well and assuming this forces him out of office which you d think it would that s another obama super out the window _meta_end_dot_

 but today sen _meta_end_dot_

 bob casey endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 i still believe very strongly that the only endorsements really worth much beyond a day of positive media are those of mayors with functioning patronage machines so i wouldn t expect casey s endorsement to be worth much in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 but he is a super delegate and in a race where every delegate clearly matters and in which super delegate momentum might pay dividends for the remaining undecided supers casey s endorsement has worth beyond his electoral muscle _meta_end_dot_

 on the pledged delegate count the big news will be texas county conventions where we will finally get definitive and official word on who won the texas delegate race _meta_end_dot_

 burnt orange report will have full coverage _meta_end_dot_
