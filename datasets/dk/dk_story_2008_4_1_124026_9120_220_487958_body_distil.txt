  ummm _meta_end_dot_

 yay _meta_end_question_

 huzzah _meta_end_exclamation_

 when the fbi raided the congressional office of rep _meta_end_dot_

 william jefferson he of the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cash in the freezer and seized his papers and computers in their free ranging search for evidence the executive branch dangerously overstepped its bounds _meta_end_dot_

 and with the case alleging corruption of a democratic member of congress solidifying the brave guardians of constitutional principles on capitol hill cast all caution to the wind disregarded the horrific optics of the jefferson case and did right by the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 ah how refreshing _meta_end_exclamation_

 corrupt democrat has office raided by fbi _meta_end_dot_

 congressional democrats wisely compartmentalize issues and public perception of corruption and stand up for the critical principle of separation of powers _meta_end_dot_

 corrupt republican uses office to torture steal invade sovereign nations and eavesdrop on innocent americans _meta_end_dot_

 congressional democrats turn immediately to the pollsters who tell them the voters will surely punish them for seeking to compartmentalize issues and public perception of civil liberties versus security and stand up for the critical principle of separation of powers _meta_end_dot_

 makes perfect sense _meta_end_exclamation_

 after all separation of powers is sacrosanct to this congress _meta_end_dot_

 for instance congressional democrats may disagree with this president s refusal to honor duly authorized congressional subpoenas but they ll defend to the death his right to ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 as an extra bonus for those of you wondering whether the house is ever going to realize that its court case seeking enforcement of the miers and bolten subpoenas isn t going anywhere and finally settle the matter itself with inherent contempt we have this rather strong hint can t have that _meta_end_dot_
