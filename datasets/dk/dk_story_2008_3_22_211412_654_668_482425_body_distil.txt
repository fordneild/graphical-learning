  did hillary clinton risk the life of an _meta_number_ref_ year old for a photo op _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton did not risk the life of an _meta_number_ref_ year old for a photo opportunity in bosnia in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 she also didn t risk the life of her only daughter by making her stand under withering sniper fire on the tarmac in tuzla so _meta_number_ref_ years later she could burnish her foreign policy credentials by claiming her plane landed amid gunfire and that she had to scamper across the tarmac to safety _meta_end_dot_

 what hillary clinton did do _meta_number_ref_ years later was fabricate a series of events that never occurred _meta_end_dot_

 this is what clinton said on monday at george washington university in washington dc the problem is that there was no sniper fire _meta_end_dot_

 the ceremony took place on the tarmac _meta_end_dot_

 and nobody ran with their heads down to get in to vehicles in fear of being shot _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if there had been sniper fire there are few things more callous than knowing you re a target but nonetheless pulling to your chest an _meta_number_ref_ year old girl and allow your daughter to stand by your side of course clinton wasn t using the _meta_number_ref_ year old emina bicakcic as a human flak vest _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t have to because th ere is peace now emina told clinton according to reporter john pomfret s report in the washington post the following day because mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton signed it _meta_end_dot_

 all this peace _meta_end_dot_

 i love it in nitpicker s diary kossack reglogge makes it clear that the landing preceding the ceremony in the video was hillary s only landing by plane in tuzla _meta_end_dot_

 reglogge s claims are corroborated in salon and the washington post nobody was shot at _meta_end_dot_

 in the wapo a former clinton staffer gives her impression of the trip well i m about to go out to meet friends for a beer and it s not inconceivable that i could be mugged _meta_end_dot_

 however saying at a later date that i could have been mugged so i took precautions and saying i was mugged are not the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the clinton staffer s recollections are nice context but they do nothing to reconcile what clinton said with what appears overwhelmingly to be the truth _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very peculiar lie _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a campaign ender but it s certainly a significant screw up and it provides an opportunity for the media and maybe the obama campaign to ask why the hell she made it up _meta_end_dot_

 look for this to be joke fodder on all the late night talk shows why would clinton say she was under fire when she wasn t _meta_end_question_

 it s not like she could possibly have confused her imagined incident with another incident in which she was shot at _meta_end_dot_

 hilary clinton was never in combat she was never under fire _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes candidates say profoundly stupid things _meta_end_dot_

 gerald ford may have lost the _meta_number_ref_ election in the second debate with jimmy carter when he made the bizarre claim that there was no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a ford administration i don t believe that the poles consider themselves dominated by the soviet union but at least that ridiculous statement wasn t about ford s personal experiences _meta_end_dot_

 when during the bitburg controversy ronald reagan was asked a question about nazi massacres he said i know all the bad things that happened in that war _meta_end_dot_

 i was in uniform four years myself as lou cannon wrote in president reagan the role of a lifetime reagan did indeed know about the bad things that happened at least if they had been recorded on film reagan regularly blended real events reel events and imagined events often with him playing a starring role _meta_end_dot_

 in this case what s recorded on film does indeed include hilary clinton but nothing bad happened _meta_end_dot_

 what happened was the same thing that happened over and over again during clinton s _meta_number_ref_ years as first lady she showed up in another country dignitaries met her on the tarmac and no shots were fired _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders is clinton almost wishes she had at least once come under sniper fire as if having been shot at would have helped her secure the nomination that she probably is beginning to realize has slipped away _meta_end_dot_

 in james thurber s the secret life of walter mitty quotidian events inspire reveries of grand but imagined adventures _meta_end_dot_

 it s a wistful tale of a man whose fantasies of heroism belie his boring life _meta_end_dot_

 according to the new dictionary of cultural literacy an ordinary person who dreams of leading a romantic life may be called a walter mitty _meta_end_dot_

 this incident with clinton is a walter mitty moment wherein she makes her experiences in this case a relatively uneventful stop in peaceful post war bosnia in to a moment of high drama and danger _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama may not have an excess of foreign policy experience _meta_end_dot_

 but i d prefer that our presidential nominee not have a lot of experience but also not claim brushes with danger that never happened _meta_end_dot_

 walter mitty is a compelling fictional character that captured some of the sense of thwarted dreams of adventure and achievement many of us succumb to in our indulgent reveries _meta_end_dot_

 but walter mitty would make a terrible president _meta_end_dot_
