  the campaign volunteers fanning out around iowa and new hampshire probably are finding themselves in some odd out of the way towns _meta_end_dot_

 one of the rewards of a life spent on the move is that you get to see a lot of colorful small towns _meta_end_dot_

 for a long time it s been a hobby of mine to collect colorful place names and this is as good an occasion as any to celebrate off beat nomenclature _meta_end_dot_

 began as a child noticing strange names _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t really think twice about the indian toponyms of new england which seemed natural and inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 but i was intrigued by mangled mispronunciations of borrowed foreign names such as cairo il havre de grace and calais in both me and vt it rhymes with palace _meta_end_dot_

 while living abroad i started to collect what i d call laugh out loud place names such as great snoring in england as well as giggleswick nasty and leatherhead an arch conservative town _meta_end_dot_

 germany has its anger yeah i know the word means meadow but still _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the u s _meta_end_dot_

 that has something close to a gazillion peculiar place names _meta_end_dot_

 my region of pennsylvania boasts a grimsville actually rather a pleasant little town a krumsville speaks for itself and a virginville this one seems to have a lot of promise until you ve actually gotten familiar with it _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is a considerable distance from intercourse _meta_end_dot_

 there s an oddville ky and frostproof fl not today perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 my parents live in nh close to a lummoxville road which suggests there once was a village by that name _meta_end_dot_

 but for sheer descriptive power it s hard to top the name of a small town we used to live near in nc tick bite _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who can beat that deserves some major mojo _meta_end_dot_
