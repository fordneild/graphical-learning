  remember last week when a number of wealthy clinton supporters announced plans to launch the american leadership project a _meta_number_ref_ to boost her candidacy in ohio and texas _meta_end_question_

 funny thing happened between last wednesday and the ensuing ad blitz the ad blitz never happened _meta_end_dot_

 so far as anyone can tell not one ad has actually aired on television even though they ve already shot one _meta_end_dot_

 there s one of two reasons why this has happened i d reckon either the donors don t exist anymore to fund such an effort or between the potential contributors and the organization there s a lack of will to engage in what seems to be a clear violation of law now i happen to be a big fan of philadelphia lawyering but bauer s point remains valid _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said before a group that forms on the eve of primary elections advertises only in the immediate primary election states and has no track record whatsoever of any kind of issue advocacy outside such context _meta_end_dot_

 well it s damn hard in those circumstances to claim you re not in it for the purpose of influencing the elections still despite the fact that a citizen complaint has been filed with the fec the alp still insists that it was all legal so then what s the holdup _meta_end_question_

 this may be a clue the alp s website claims that the names of all donors contributing more than _meta_dollor_ref_ will be disclosed within _meta_number_ref_ hours they ve yet to make any such disclosure _meta_end_dot_

 i ve emailed the alp to ask for a copy of that list and if it ever appears i will let you know _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime you d have to figure that if they had the money they d be using it right now in ohio and texas which begs the question have the _meta_dollor_ref_ contributors to clinton s campaign i e her financial base already given up _meta_end_question_
