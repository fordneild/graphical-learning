  today at noon blue majority donna edwards will be debating al wynn who she s challenging in maryland s february _meta_number_ref_ primary _meta_end_dot_

 the debate is on wamu radio s the politics hour with kojo and jonetta and will include listener questions _meta_end_dot_

 al wynn had better hope he can do better with listener questions than he did with scripted ones in this campaign video _meta_end_dot_

 even answering his own campaign s questions delivered by a pretend reporter he s long winded and incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 wamu streams live so you can listen for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile throw some love to donna edwards over at the blue majority actblue page _meta_end_dot_

 on the web donna edwards for congress blue majority actblue page race tracker wiki md _meta_number_ref_
