  one thing that s fascinating about the huckabee victory in iowa is that the movement that propelled him to victory his evangelical base is truly a cousin to our very own people powered movement _meta_end_dot_

 think about it these are people that have been taken for granted by the republican establishment exploited and overworked only to receive crumbs and empty rhetoric in return _meta_end_dot_

 sick of being marginalized except when needed election time they have taken matters into their own hands and without money or professional organization propelled their candidate one of their own to victory _meta_end_dot_

 i ve noted before that ron paul was the only people powered candidate in the race based on his ridiculous fundraising _meta_dollor_ref_ million in q_meta_number_ref_ alone _meta_end_dot_

 but his movement was only able to muster _meta_number_ref_ percent in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 it s a new movement like the dean people in _meta_number_ref_ and still finding its sea legs in an unfamiliar environment _meta_end_dot_

 they can deliver lawn signs and stickers but it might be a while before they can deliver votes we ll see how they do in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s supporters may not have much scratch to give but boy can they deliver bodies and votes even when facing a full frontal assault from their party s establishment _meta_end_dot_

 being part of the gop s ground game going on two decades they ve got the experience to actually deliver _meta_end_dot_

 they are true gate crashers perhaps the best we ve seen in politics _meta_end_dot_

 trained as worker bees for the gop machine they are now throwing off those shackles and attempting a veritable coup _meta_end_dot_

 their impudence has of course earned the fierce enmity of their party s neocon and corporate con wings and they will strike hard with every rovian tool at their disposal _meta_end_dot_

 gate crashing is never greeted with open arms _meta_end_dot_
