  in an interview today with bbc urdu the militant leader whom the pakistan government accuses of having planned the assassination of benazir bhutto called for an independent investigation into the killing _meta_end_dot_

 from deutsche presse agentur cernig comments _meta_end_dot_

 of course mehsud wants his call for an independent inquiry to be interpreted as a mark of innocence _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he could well be innocent of this particular murder _meta_end_dot_

 the allegation by pakistani authorities that they intercepted a message from mehsud congratulating the killers hasn t been corroborated by other intelligence agencies and certainly looks for all the world like an official stitch up _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that this interview is intended mainly to stir up further unrest in pakistan against pervez musharraf and to paint his opposition to an international investigation as evidence of a conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 stranger and stranger _meta_end_dot_
