  this isn t a surprise but it s lousy news nonetheless the mississippi supreme court as expected has overruled a lower court s decision and scheduled the special election to fill the seat of retired sen _meta_end_dot_

 trent lott for next november in accordance with republican governor haley barbour s wishes _meta_end_dot_

 the decision is available here and i recommend reading it especially for justice graves dissenting opinion the article under question is section _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the mississippi code of _meta_number_ref_ the majority has ruled essentially that a year can be intepreted as meaning _meta_number_ref_ days rather than a calendar year and that the meaning of the word shall is ambiguous in this context and does not necessarily mean something that will occur in the future _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with justice graves that that is a rather ridiculous intepretation but it is what it is _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of when the special election is held we should have at least a fighting chance against senator roger wicker appointed by barbour to fill lott s seat temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 we have two serious candidates in the race former governor ronnie musgrove and former u s _meta_end_dot_

 representative ronnie shows _meta_end_dot_

 past polling has shown musgrove competitive for this seat i have not yet seen any polling for shows _meta_end_dot_

 musgrove in particular would have had quite a bit to gain had the election actually been held in march his name recognition is near universal and greater than wicker s due to his terms as governor and lieutenant governor _meta_end_dot_

 that advantage will certainly be blunted as wicker will have for the november election nearly a year of incumbency under his belt plenty of time to campaign in a republican state and a presidential election on the same day to spur republican turnout _meta_end_dot_

 still we should have a pretty decent shot in november _meta_end_dot_

 the nrsc is starved for cash so they won t be in much of a position to help wicker his polling so far has been surprisingly weak given the republican tilt of the state and the republican brand name is weakened across the board _meta_end_dot_

 if we do end up with another democratic wave in the fall which i think is entirely possible it may well carry our candidate to victory in this race _meta_end_dot_
