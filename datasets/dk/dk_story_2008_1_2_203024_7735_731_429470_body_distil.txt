  as promised mississippi s democratic attorney general jim hood has filed suit challenging the date set by governor haley barbour for the special election to replace retired sen _meta_end_dot_

 trent lott barbour feels naturally that wicker is more likely to win an election held on the same day as a high turnout presidential election with a year of incumbency under his belt than a low turnout special election _meta_end_dot_

 the danger of holding a special election would be increased if a candidate who has the name recognition associated with having been elected statewide like former governors ray mabus and ronnie musgrove were to run for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 as a congressman wicker has limited name rec outside mississippi s _meta_number_ref_st _meta_end_dot_

 here s what mississippi law has to say on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 section _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the mississippi code of _meta_number_ref_ hat tip to thebigkahuna emphasis mine barbour s argument is that since a statewide mississippi election was held in _meta_number_ref_ the same year lott resigned he is freed from the _meta_number_ref_ days restriction in appointing wicker and can hold the next election in november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but if i understand the law correctly it states that if a vacancy arises during a general election year such as _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ the special election is to be held on the same day as the general election which would have been back in november _meta_end_dot_

 that was before lott resigned of course _meta_end_dot_

 the law does not specify as far as i can tell what to do if lott resigns between the _meta_number_ref_ election and the end of the year which is in fact what he did _meta_end_dot_

 but i should think that because it is obviously impossible to retroactively hold the election in november _meta_number_ref_ which is technically what the law mandates the state must proceed as it would under ordinary circumstances which is to say by holding the election within _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 hood has made good on his promise to take the case to court so we will see what happens _meta_end_dot_
