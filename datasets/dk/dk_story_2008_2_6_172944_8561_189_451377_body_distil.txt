  this story is getting way too old _meta_end_dot_

 just to make sure this is very very clear _meta_end_dot_

 the defense department knew the company provided defective armor and in fact sued the company over it _meta_end_dot_

 they knew that the kevlar the company was using in the helmets it created did not meet critical minimum standards _meta_end_dot_

 but while that very suit was pending they ordered more armor _meta_end_dot_

 our vetvoice and votevets friend brandon friedman has more here _meta_end_dot_

 by the way _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american troops have died in iraq as of today _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how many had helmets given to them by the defense department after they knew they were defective _meta_end_dot_
