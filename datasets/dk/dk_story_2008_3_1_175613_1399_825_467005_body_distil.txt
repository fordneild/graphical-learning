  compromise how come whenever democrats end up compromising on a given issue they inevitably end up compromising their principles and giving the administration everything it wants in the process as mcjoan documented yesterday rumors are rampant that the house leadership will split the protect at t act making it easier for the president and his party to get the telecom amnesty they want of course the gop would be ok with it _meta_end_exclamation_

 they love compromise when it gives them everything they want _meta_end_dot_

 you would think that democrats learned something from their past albeit limited successes _meta_end_dot_

 remember when the administration and gop whipped themselves up in a frenzy over the social security crisis _meta_end_question_

 remember how much pressure there was for democrats in congress to act _meta_end_question_

 and remember all the concern trolling from the right and from the media and the wringing of hands within our own party about how dangerous it would be for the democrats to well not act _meta_end_question_

 and do you recall how the democrats stuck by their principles and refused to fall into the ticking time bomb trap _meta_end_question_

 i m sure you do _meta_end_dot_

 if only house democrats could remember how that all played out _meta_end_dot_

 because with respect to fisa there is no crisis _meta_end_dot_

 the current law provides for the surveillance of terrorist targets _meta_end_dot_

 and the surveillance that was initiated while the paa was in effect can continue for one year _meta_end_dot_

 our government has ample flexible and legal tools to conduct thorough and emergency surveillance to keep us safe _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the only crisis is the republican party s panic attack over having telecoms answer for their possibly illegal behavior in a court of law _meta_end_dot_

 will blue dog democrats throw the republican party a lifesaver or an anvil _meta_end_question_

 their contact information is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 let them know there is no fisa crisis and there is no reason to give the administration everything it wants at the expense of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 update for more on how there is no crisis check out dday s excellent diary here _meta_end_dot_
