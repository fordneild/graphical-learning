  for the past six years activists progressive bloggers and a handful of traditional media pundits have accused mister bush richard bruce cheney and others in the cronyfest running the executive branch of lying us into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the relentless response everybody from condoleeza rice to bill kristol to the least read right wing pundithug has been to say we re the liars and traitors as well for daring suggest such a thing at a time when the nation faces the most dire threat since adolf hitler gave the go ahead to heavy water experiments blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 eventually without apologies of course there were a few admissions delivered in the passive aggressive tense popularized decades ago by richard nixon mistakes were made now thanks to the center for public integrity and the fund for independence in journalism everybody can check out those lies for themselves at the war card orchestrated deception on the path to war _meta_end_dot_

 but cpi has done a real service to place nearly _meta_number_ref_ of these in one easy to access location _meta_end_dot_

 mister bush told the most lies _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 colin powell clocked in second with _meta_number_ref_ lies _meta_end_dot_
