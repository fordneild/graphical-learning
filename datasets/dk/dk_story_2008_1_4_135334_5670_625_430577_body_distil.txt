  right wing blogworld is abuzz with something we here haven t heard a great deal about the possibility that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush may issue an executive order directing federal agencies not to execute spending directives designated as earmarks in the recently signed omnibus appropriations bill _meta_end_dot_

 the idea appears to have surfaced first perhaps unsurprisingly at the heritage foundation _meta_end_dot_

 the vehicle of the executive order got a brief mention a day later in the washington post s coverage of bush s general alleged dissatisfaction with the number and cost of those earmarks but it s not entirely clear from what the white house has said whether or not they believe an executive order is necessary to do this _meta_end_dot_

 as with most of this congress exercises of power this administration s first instinct is simply to ignore it and for the unitary executive to exercise its inherent power to just direct the agencies not to spend the money as outlined by congress _meta_end_dot_

 can they do that _meta_end_question_

 well in their world of course they can and will do anything they want until some larger force makes them stop _meta_end_dot_

 but what about in the real world _meta_end_question_

 here s what the congressional research service crs has to say pdf note that this is something we addressed in a slightly different context back in july when we were looking at how effective a hypothetical defunding of the iraq occupation might be _meta_end_dot_

 another crs report a defense budget primer pdf told us that s pretty much true of most earmarks and applicable to the other agencies as well _meta_end_dot_

 but if they re not binding what makes them stick under normal circumstances _meta_end_question_

 the first crs report cited above titled earmarks and limitations in appropriations bills tells us the agencies comply because they must justify their budget requests to congress each year _meta_end_dot_

 the defense budget primer puts it in more concrete terms george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush of course does not give a shit about what happens to next year s appropriations _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly i can t imagine that he d be all that worried about the agencies being punished by congress even if he weren t on his way out of office next year because no one on capitol hill has given him any reason to expect any kind of serious constitutional level pushback on anything anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it s also worth noting that we ve been down this road before so it can t come as a complete shock _meta_end_dot_

 nro s phil kerpen notes that this move has precedent _meta_end_dot_

 and surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 it comes from the reagan administration _meta_end_dot_

 so this sort of power grabbing it appears doesn t really just go away forever when we elect a democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 it just goes into stasis to be revived by the next republican _meta_end_dot_

 the result of that standoff by the way _meta_end_question_

 another tick mark in the long and growing count of reasons why aggressive forceful push back from congress across the board is absolutely critical to the effective exercise of power _meta_end_dot_

 but don t get me started _meta_end_dot_

 so if most earmarks aren t legally binding what s the attraction of the executive order _meta_end_question_

 well for one thing as the crs report on earmarks and limitations notes there are many different kinds of things included under the broadest definition of earmarks and that includes some that actually are included in the text of appropriations bills and therefore are legally binding _meta_end_dot_

 further as the heritage foundation s memo notes the attraction of the executive order then is its ability to possibly overcome the binding language in the bill _meta_end_dot_

 would bush do it _meta_end_question_

 there are very few political reasons for him not to _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly has no reason to believe the congress is prepared to vindicate its prerogatives against him see our long and ongoing discussion of congressional subpoena power _meta_end_dot_

 and any punishment exacted on the agencies in next year s appropriations is someone else s problem _meta_end_dot_

 besides consider the optics of a democratic congress finally roused to go to war with this president _meta_end_dot_

 over earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s the practical incarnation of the power of the purse and even defensible as a method under normal circumstances of insisting on congressional spending priorities over the president s _meta_end_dot_

 but earmarks are also most familiar to the voting public by its more vulgar name pork so it should come as no surprise that bush just may be testing the waters in a backhanded fashion as we speak the dot it should be noted may indeed have a point _meta_end_dot_

 dorgan s provision may well have been poorly drafted leaving them enough wiggle room to pull this end around _meta_end_dot_

 but the subtext here may be an effort to gauge congressional resolve when it sees its power of the purse tested first on grounds justifiable with creative legal interpretations and later just maybe in an outright frontal assault _meta_end_dot_

 and if those earmarks are now in danger after all now would be the time to recall what appropriations chairman david obey suggested in mid december that bill as we all know did indeed get pared down on the earmark side and the way was in fact paved for _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 how politically savvy and realistic is that strategic retreat looking now _meta_end_question_

 as our friend occams hatchet put it what part of cataclysmic fight to the death did you not understand
