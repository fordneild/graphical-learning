  yesterday harry reid gave republicans another chance to show their true colors in this fight do they mean it when they say they want to protect america or is it about protecting at t _meta_end_question_

 three guesses what the republicans did _meta_end_dot_

 this was the law the protect america act that republicans told us was necessary for preventing the end of the world _meta_end_dot_

 until democrats said bullpuckey and let it expire after which the world did not end _meta_end_dot_

 now that bill isn t enough because the gaps in intelligence they insisted would cripple us if the law expired are not nearly as important as letting at t off the hook for illegally spying on us _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are still playing politics with this bill still using the threat of the apocalypse to scare their dwindling base into organized calling efforts against people like dem freshman kirsten gillibrand who stood up to the pressure and voted for the sane amnesty free house fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if all those callers know that they ve been duped into trying to protect their phone company _meta_end_question_
