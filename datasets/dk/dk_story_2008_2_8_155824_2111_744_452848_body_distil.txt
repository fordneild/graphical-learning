  cheney spoke yesterday at cpac the conference for people for whom reality is just an illusion foisted upon them by a cold and liberal universe _meta_end_dot_

 the universe you see is full of dark matter called librons which in addition to keeping the universe from flying apart like ann coulter in front of a television camera have the unfortunate side effect of inverting perceptions of reality for all but the most trained randian observers _meta_end_dot_

 oh and scientologists i m supposed to say at this point something like you can t make this up but of course you can make this stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to make it up _meta_end_dot_

 that s the whole point _meta_end_dot_

 some highlights _meta_end_dot_

 and then he farted candy and rainbows _meta_end_dot_

 and all the little woodland creatures came out from under the floorboards to help sew him a magnificent new dress for the ball _meta_end_dot_

 and at that point the constitution fairy sprinkled her magic constitution dust over the land and all the tapes of the cia torturing prisoners magically erased themselves and the waterboarded detainees became un waterboarded and the vast program of illegal domestic espionage so critical to our national security that president george constitution bush has threatened to veto all fisa legislation for all time unless everyone involved gets retroactive amnesty for their illegal acts suddenly became constitutional _meta_end_dot_

 because one of the lesser known articles of the constitution is that no mention of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by an administration official may take place without a possibly hallucinatory drug induced conflation of it and saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 and shrek _meta_end_dot_

 shrek was also there _meta_end_dot_

 i like it _meta_end_dot_

 reality as practiced by a man who can t tell the difference between a grown man standing next to him and a tiny barely flight capable bird _meta_end_dot_

 it s not so much a cpac speech as it is nambla for the mind it s a comic book speech delivered by a comic book man to a comic book audience _meta_end_dot_

 cheney doesn t believe in merely denying reality he believes in pinning it down attaching electrodes to it then just clubbing it to death for fun _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is it d be easy to ascribe behavior like this to mental illness presuming he really believes any of the things he says _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not clear he does _meta_end_dot_

 in all likelihood he knows fully well how ridiculous it all sounds but in an audience hand picked for their willingness to accept any premise no matter how ridiculous in order to feel good about their own bigotries nobody will ever call him out on it _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting because once again one would think it would be a key component of rational public discourse for people to indeed call him out on his happy camouflage colored delusions _meta_end_dot_

 but it s somehow off limits in the press to point out when a public official is an unmitigated reality sodomizing liar _meta_end_dot_

 haircuts and pantsuits fair game _meta_end_dot_

 pointing out that a smaller share of the national income means a larger share that restrained spending means more spending that keeping to the limits of the constitution means breaking those limits that no torture means torture and that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ means anything else he wants it to mean at any moment in time pointing those things out are uncouth activities to be delegated to people like jon stewart stephen colbert keith olbermann and a handful of crazy uncivilized blogs _meta_end_dot_

 and we re reduced to just making fun of it because really what else are you going to do _meta_end_question_

 how do you refute something that s self refuting _meta_end_question_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_
