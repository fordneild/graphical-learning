  yup _meta_end_dot_

 yet another tiresome screed about the mythical vital center that supposedly no longer holds _meta_end_dot_

 and while most of the article is utter bunk this is particularly so first of all a truly partisan media didn t come into being until the late _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh s syndicated show debuted in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fox news channel came on the scene in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent voted _meta_end_dot_

 but by _meta_number_ref_ when rush came on the scene it was already down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then what happened _meta_end_question_

 in _meta_number_ref_ turnout was up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was a bad year as bill clinton s obvious reelection trajectory kept people home _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and then with the rise of progressive partisan media the blogs and air america turnout was up again in _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so in other words the last election in which this nation lacked a partisan media was _meta_number_ref_ and turnout was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ by _meta_number_ref_ with a strong conservative partisan media and with a nascent progressive partisan media it was at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we can gauge how the trends continue given the maturation of our media _meta_end_dot_

 in any case that hardly justifies the thesis in the newsweek piece linked above _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it kind of shatters it _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the trends have been similar in the mid term elections _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the biggest factor in decreasing participation has been the lack of competitive races thanks to the incumbency racket and gerrymandering of congressional districts _meta_end_dot_

 check out what happened in _meta_number_ref_ so turnout was higher again invalidating the thesis above _meta_end_dot_

 but what s even more telling is what happened in states with competitive races virginia and montana were the two states with people powered candidates promoted heavily by the growing progressive partisan media _meta_end_dot_

 it s telling that virginia with one of the strongest local netroots presence in the nation had record turnout _meta_end_dot_

 montana was up _meta_end_dot_

 ohio with its contested senate race was up as was missouri _meta_end_dot_

 michigan had a tough governor s race _meta_end_dot_

 connecticut had the lieberman lamont contest _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile voting age youth who are most likely to be on facebook hence supposedly political moderates voted at a _meta_number_ref_ year high _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence is actually quite clear that partisan media are engaging and energizing a new generation of voters driving participation in our political process higher than before _meta_end_dot_

 aside from the silliness over the vital center the fact is people want a choice and when given one they are much happier to take part _meta_end_dot_
