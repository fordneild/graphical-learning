  all i have to say is don t hold your breath while this is potentially good news from today s wall street journal we all know what the bush administration s idea of compromise is _meta_end_dot_

 the article continues the rub comes in at the product they can support the most encouraging aspect of this is that the administration played the fear card for all that it was worth and failed _meta_end_dot_

 that is in large part thanks to the group of _meta_number_ref_ freshman democrats in the house who were targeted directly with ads and robocalls _meta_end_dot_

 these folks some of them in very tough districts stood tough against those attacks and rendered them toothless _meta_end_dot_

 while the democrats have gained critical ground the fight is obviously not over _meta_end_dot_

 as emptywheel points out mukasey and mcconnell are still plying dishonest claims the wsj story as well as an an article in today s roll call subscription point to steny hoyer as the lead negotiator and the link to a deal sez hoyer it s a vastly different environment but that doesn t mean that the administration is going to give up on its grail retroactive telecom amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 the house has provided a fair and responsible solution for this sticking point and need to hold the line _meta_end_dot_

 if you haven t already thanked steny hoyer and the house dems who stood tough on fisa now is a good chance to do it and to tell them to continue to hold the line _meta_end_dot_

 we re winning this one keep up the good work _meta_end_dot_
