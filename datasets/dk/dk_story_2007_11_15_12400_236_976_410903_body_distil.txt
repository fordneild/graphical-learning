  larry grant s strong run for idaho s _meta_number_ref_st in _meta_number_ref_ succeeded in proving to idaho dems that they can be competitive particularly in this district that has a long tradition of supporting dems _meta_end_dot_

 that tradition has eroded some in the past decade and a half but the vestiges of it are still there and can be built upon _meta_end_dot_

 at least that s the calculation of walt minnick boise businessman and former nixon white house aide who has decided to jump into the race to unseat bill sali _meta_end_dot_

 upping the ante and bad news for grant is former gov _meta_end_dot_

 cece andrus s endorsement of minnick _meta_end_dot_

 this summer idaho statesman political columnist dan popkey wrote a bit of a hit job in which a handful of idaho dems all off the record criticized grant s handling of the race _meta_end_dot_

 from what i saw and the discussions i ve had with folks in idaho some of these criticisms are justified some overblown and certainly popkey s presentation of the story was unnecessarily snide and dismissive _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate the column probably spurred more than a few dems to think about getting into the race _meta_end_dot_

 one dem already has retired army colonel rand lewis who is a bit of an unknown quantity being new to the state and to politics there _meta_end_dot_

 minnick has been involved in idaho politics for a long time and has one race under his belt he challenged craig for senate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s a former president and ceo of a timber company trus joist international and is currently chairman of another company summerwinds garden centers _meta_end_dot_

 he definitely has the capacity to self fund a good chunk of his run _meta_end_dot_

 the good news for idaho dems is that they re going to have something that s been a rarity in these long lean and discouraging days for dems there a primary with well qualified opponents a fact not lost on grant _meta_end_dot_

 grant and minnick aren t far apart on the issues so the question will be who s the better campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 grant should have an edge in name recognition since he just ran and many in the district are newcomers to idaho who wouldn t have been around for minnick s _meta_number_ref_ run _meta_end_dot_
