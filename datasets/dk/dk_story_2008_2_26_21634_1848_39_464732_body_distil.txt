  a spokesman for the defense department inspector general s office told me on tuesday that they will conduct an inquiry into the multi year delay in purchasing mine resistant vehicles for marines serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in a letter dated feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the marine corps requested the inspector general to investigate allegations that the delays led to hundreds of casualties for marines serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the spokesman gary comerford said that within a few days the dod ig will formally announce an audit or review of mrap purchases for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the long delay in ordering mraps and the resulting casualties for combat troops is a huge scandal _meta_end_dot_

 it s also emblematic of many other bush administration failures in iraq especially its seeming indifference to the welfare of troops caught in the middle of a prolonged civil war _meta_end_dot_

 shockingly the scandal never has been investigated adequately _meta_end_dot_

 although a house armed services subcommittee did hold mrap hearings last july these concentrated on how many mine resistant vehicles were needed to the exclusion of that other critical topic the causes and results of the delays _meta_end_dot_

 as chairman gene taylor described the intent of those hearings _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile robert gates pentagon is so determined to portray its new mrap acquisition program positively that it prefers to forget its years of indifference to urgent requests from field commanders _meta_end_dot_

 gates is not eager to expose what went wrong _meta_end_dot_

 in part it s a question of shielding the white house from blame for minimizing the danger presented by the iraqi insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 the absence of investigations is a scandal in its own right _meta_end_dot_

 pressure has been building in some quarters within the military to expose why the pentagon failed to respond sooner even as casualties from ieds skyrocketed _meta_end_dot_

 in particular retired marine officer franz gayl has been pushing hard to expose the corps failures in acquiring needed equipment _meta_end_dot_

 now a civilian technology adviser for the marines he filed last may for whistleblower protection because of reprisals after he met with congressional staffers _meta_end_dot_

 senators biden and bond rebuked the corps last september for apparent retaliation against him _meta_end_dot_

 the marines finally decided to accept a proposal that gayl write a report about their recent failures in procurement _meta_end_dot_

 gayl s study pdf completed on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ catalogued a wide range of problems in the marine corps and pentagon procurement programs _meta_end_dot_

 evidently the marines weren t entirely eager to facilitate this study usa today reports now that the marines are blocking gayle from pursuing the matter further _meta_end_dot_

 that may not be true a representative of the government accountability project quoted by the paper says it s false _meta_end_dot_

 in any event gayl s report concluded that deaths from ieds in iraq could have been cut by _meta_percent_ref_ if a _meta_number_ref_ marine request for mraps had been granted _meta_end_dot_

 he also points out that the commandant of the marine corps misled congress last year about the scandal _meta_end_dot_

 the marines repeatedly distanced themselves from the report at first advising the ap that it is not an official study or report _meta_end_dot_

 but on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ senators biden and bond called on the pentagon to investigate gayl s allegations _meta_end_dot_

 and thus three days later the marines had decided to ask the pentagon inspector general to investigate the substance of gayl s report because of the seriousness of the allegations _meta_end_dot_

 that request has been accepted now according to the oig spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally there have been no major audits related to iraq initiated by dod oig for more than a year to judge by this summary of ongoing projects _meta_end_dot_

 it s a remarkable gap given that new projects were added throughout the years _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yet not a single new iraq project has been added since claude kicklighter became inspector general last april _meta_end_dot_

 i hope and trust that dod oig will pursue the mrap investigation vigorously but in any case a full audit will take a long time to complete _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime as nick schwellenbach has been urging congress really ought to hold hearings into how and why this fiasco occurred and what the consequences were for our troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 such hearings are long overdue in fact _meta_end_dot_

 i d urge you to contact sen _meta_end_dot_

 carl levin and other members of the senate armed services committee and ask them to schedule hearings into the causes and results of the delays in acquiring mine resistant vehicles for our troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_number_ref_ pm on wednesday anyhow three marine generals are appearing before the house armed services subcommittee on seapower _meta_end_dot_

 they should be grilled about the gayl report s findings _meta_end_dot_
