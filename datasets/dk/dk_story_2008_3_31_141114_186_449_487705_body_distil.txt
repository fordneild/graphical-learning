  clinton needs florida and michigan to remain undetermined _meta_end_dot_

 the more uncertainty she can cast on the status of the delegate count and popular vote the better her already thin arguments to the super delegates she can make _meta_end_dot_

 florida and michigan broke dnc rules by moving up their contests ahead of the dnc sanctioned calendar _meta_end_dot_

 at the time clinton approved of the move _meta_end_dot_

 her chief campaign pit bull even voted for the sanctions as a sitting member of the rules committee _meta_end_dot_

 but given that the rules don t apply when wearing his clinton campaign hat the status of michigan and florida have been a clinton campaign obsession ever since _meta_end_dot_

 now it s clear that neither florida or michigan have the money or political will to stage new contests _meta_end_dot_

 and while the obama campaign has no impetus to seat the delegations until after the nominee has been chosen the status of those two states inject enough fud to fuel clinton s efforts _meta_end_dot_

 if their status was settled then clinton s still perilous math position would be obvious and unassailable _meta_end_dot_

 i say seat them _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 end of story _meta_end_dot_

 but the clinton campaign would never agree _meta_end_dot_

 the dean of florida s dnc delegation has two solutions settling florida with only a _meta_number_ref_ delegate loss would be a great outcome for obama _meta_end_dot_

 he likely couldn t do better in a real contest _meta_end_dot_

 the only downside to the obama camp would be the clinton effort to try and inject clinton s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ popular vote margin into the debate over the overall popular vote but few supers would take that seriously _meta_end_dot_

 as for michigan stick with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ then halve their delegation _meta_end_dot_
