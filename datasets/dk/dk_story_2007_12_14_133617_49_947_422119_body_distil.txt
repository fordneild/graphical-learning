  last week kentucky state auditor crit luallen a popular elected official who had been courted by the dscc to challenge senate minority leader mitch mcconnell opted against a senate bid _meta_end_dot_

 following that news attorney marine and iraq war veteran andrew horne who ran for congress last year in kentucky s _meta_number_ref_rd district has decided to jump into the senate race _meta_end_dot_

 here s an excerpt from his press release horne at least clearly shows no hesitation about going hard after mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 that s critical because mcconnell certainly won t pull any punches _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to get an indication of what his chances are at this point _meta_end_dot_

 in his _meta_number_ref_ race in ky _meta_number_ref_ horne lost quite badly in the democratic primary by nearly _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 his fundraising was respectable enough but he ll have to step it up dramatically for a race against mcconnell a master fundraiser obsessed with money with _meta_dollor_ref_ million already stacked up for the race _meta_end_dot_

 horne has never held elected office and he has limited name recognition outside jefferson county at this point _meta_end_dot_

 still mcconnell is vulnerable _meta_end_dot_

 he s faced a number of difficult races in his time his approval ratings have not been great and he s become one of the most prominent faces of an unpopular republican party _meta_end_dot_

 dissatisfaction with mcconnell is sufficient that larry forgy an unsuccessful _meta_number_ref_ candidate for governor who lost to democrat paul patton is apparently seriously considering entering the race _meta_end_dot_

 not as a republican though _meta_end_dot_

 as an indie _meta_end_dot_

 a spirited primary challenge against mcconnell would have helped us a guy running to the right of mcconnell in the general election is even better _meta_end_dot_

 horne isn t necessarily going to be alone either _meta_end_dot_

 kentucky attorney general greg stumbo and businessman greg fischer are considering the race as well _meta_end_dot_

 several independent polls have shown stumbo competitive with mcconnell holding him under _meta_percent_ref_ in head to head races _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that the dscc having failed to get their preferred candidate crit luallen in the race is probably going to adopt a wait and see approach in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 if horne or someone else gets traction they ll step in and help as they did in virginia in _meta_number_ref_ but they may not be in right from the get go _meta_end_dot_

 this race has been compared to virginia last cycle both for the reason i mentioned above and because i think people want to see horne as a new jim webb _meta_end_dot_

 leaving the horne webb comparison aside i think here are the differences between this race and virginia last year _meta_end_dot_

 for one mcconnell actually is somewhat less popular than allen was at this point in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly don t remember allen polling under _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ nor facing the threat of a primary or independent challenge from the right _meta_end_dot_

 that said i also wouldn t expect mcconnell to make a macaca esque blunder _meta_end_dot_

 he has made some highly offensive remarks about our soldiers of course horne himself an iraq war veteran is just one of those professional soldiers for whose lives mitch mcconnell shows such concern _meta_end_dot_

 he has a sharp response indeed _meta_end_dot_

 there may be more movement in this race as we re still waiting to hear what stumbo fischer and forgy are going to do _meta_end_dot_

 at a minimum we now have a candidate in the kentucky senate race who can and will draw a clear distinction between himself and mitch mcconnell on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 on the web andrew horne for u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate
