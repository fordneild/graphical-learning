  i never got into a full swing of the cattle call this cycle because quite frankly the race had gotten boring _meta_end_dot_

 hillary was way at the top and everyone else seemed to be treading water _meta_end_dot_

 but now that our media overlords have decided that it s time for a real race things do appear to be getting more interesting _meta_end_dot_

 and it doesn t hurt that edwards and obama are becoming more aggressive so help me rank the state of the race _meta_end_dot_

 the rules are that i ll rank the candidates in the order i think they d ultimately finish if the primaries started today i e _meta_end_dot_

 iowa and then explain why _meta_end_dot_

 this won t be a list of who i prefer but where i think they d end up right now _meta_end_dot_

 this is your chance to rank them as you see fit but remember rank them as you think they d finish if the elections started today rather than in your personal order of preferences _meta_end_dot_

 this is an effort to gauge the current state of the campaign not where you want it to end up next january and february _meta_end_dot_
