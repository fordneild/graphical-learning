  remember joe curl _meta_end_question_

 he s the guy who didn t just interview karl rove but also adopted his math in an effort to fluff up his beloved president bush in the washington times _meta_end_dot_

 well a blogger emailed him challenging his math and he got these responses link is not safe for work and it went on and on from there _meta_end_dot_

 i verified it with curl who reacted in a similar fashion to me _meta_end_dot_

 it s all funny of course and the guy is full of shit obviously _meta_end_dot_

 and isn t it conservative bloggers that get the vapors when they hear someone say the word fuck _meta_end_question_

 and what s with the pussy pejorative _meta_end_question_

 is the dude a neanderthal _meta_end_question_

 but the most telling part of that exchange is when curl claims his piece was a straight news piece _meta_end_dot_

 like his colleagues on fox news where he often appears he s lost hold on reality _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks made up wingnutlandia is a real place where statements like the surge is taking hold and bush is regaining his footing aren t really just incorrect opinion _meta_end_dot_

 like i said i emailed him to verify and to ask for his cites since he claimed above that he could support all the claims in his article _meta_end_dot_

 his response maybe you guys will get a different reaction from him so drop him a line and find out
