  remember that defense authorization bill that bush tried to claim he had pocket vetoed _meta_end_question_

 and remember how the congress decided to remedy bush s objection to the provision allowing gulf war vets who had been captured and tortured by saddam hussein to sue the iraqi government was to write in a waiver _meta_end_question_

 well you ll never guess what he did _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait _meta_end_dot_

 were you gonna guess he waived it _meta_end_question_

 nevermind _meta_end_dot_

 i guess you will guess what he did _meta_end_dot_

 what a shocker _meta_end_exclamation_

 and that s not all _meta_end_dot_

 after vetoing the bill and sending it back with his objections and getting his specific objections answered with a waiver provision bush still ended up issuing a signing statement on the bill _meta_end_dot_

 what a dick _meta_end_exclamation_

 you may be interested to know what provisions he claims to be nullifying by the way and what are sections _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 oh you know _meta_end_dot_

 no big deals _meta_end_dot_

 no iraq contracting commission _meta_end_dot_

 no iraq contractor whistleblower protection _meta_end_dot_

 and no defunding of permanent bases _meta_end_dot_

 la la la _meta_end_exclamation_

 nothing to see here _meta_end_exclamation_

 love that power of the purse it looks so nice up there on the mantle and not the table next to the subpoena power
