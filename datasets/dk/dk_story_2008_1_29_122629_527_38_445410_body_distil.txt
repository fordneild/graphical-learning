  senator obama provided this statement to firedoglake _meta_end_dot_

 your voices and the voices of every american who called faxed and e mailed their opposition to being illegally spied upon have been instrumental in making this happen _meta_end_dot_

 we helped derail the rush to push through the bill before the december recess and we helped in the victory yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 we are sustaining the fight as senator dodd noted in a recent floor statement _meta_end_dot_

 so if you were one of the many who made your voice heard on this issue in the past few weeks thank you _meta_end_dot_

 give yourself a pat on the back _meta_end_dot_

 but keep your phone handy _meta_end_dot_

 the senate leadership is trying to work out how to proceed _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has observed this process over the last few months knows that the weak link in holding the democratic caucus together on this issue is rockefeller _meta_end_dot_

 even while he voted with the caucus on yesterday s cloture vote he made it clear that he was as angry at dodd for standing up to him as he was the republicans for obstructing _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to get his bill passed and he is just as likely to side with the republicans in a consent agreement to push the bill through with a minimum of amendments or under a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold or undery any scenario that would limit important amendments to this bill _meta_end_dot_

 and it is unfortunately all too likely that he d be able to find a handful of blue dogs to go with him _meta_end_dot_

 so here s our new target _meta_end_dot_

 call fax and e mail senator rockefeller and the likely suspects among the democrats to urge them to make sure that all of the democratic caucus s fisa amendments get to the senate floor and that they establish a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold on democratic amendments _meta_end_dot_

 update in case anyone missed it yesterday here s sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s statement _meta_end_dot_
