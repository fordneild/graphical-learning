  it was bound to happen _meta_end_dot_

 those teases at the statesman no gory details until tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 at least popkey gets his scoop on the story finally and given his publisher s squeamishness on this story in the past his evidence this time has got to be rock solid _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be increasingly hard for craig to brazen this out _meta_end_dot_

 while craig s reaction is totally unpredictable i d say the chances he leaves office before his term is up just increased significantly _meta_end_dot_

 more tomorrow when the reaction from idaho and dc starts coming in _meta_end_dot_

 update i forgot the best part _meta_end_dot_

 update ii mcclatchy has released what appears to be the full story _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t go into the details of travel records or the witnesses popkey spoke to but does provide more information about the men including mike jones the prostitute who dropped the dime on ted haggard _meta_end_dot_
