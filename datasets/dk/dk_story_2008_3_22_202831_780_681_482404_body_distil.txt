  twenty five years ago tomorrow before a television audience president ronald reagan initiated one of the grandest defense boondoggles of all time the strategic defense initiative _meta_end_dot_

 like many boondoggles it was couched in sweet talk and lies those lines and the rest of the speech sure sounded good to many _meta_end_dot_

 as had been the case almost since the arrival of werner von braun and the other v _meta_number_ref_ rocket engineers at the end of world war ii when it came to space america talked peace and prepared for war _meta_end_dot_

 after sputnik went beeping around the planet every _meta_number_ref_ minutes in _meta_number_ref_ the effort was greatly intensified always with the threat of soviet attack as the rationale _meta_end_dot_

 this was true whether it was jfk campaigning about a bogus missile gap or a _meta_number_ref_s pentagon inflating moscow s military power at the urging of the committee on the present danger s nascent neo conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 reagan s speech was nothing new on that score _meta_end_dot_
