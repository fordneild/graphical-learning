  last sunday when moqtada al sadr announced a ceasefire that he d reached with the iraqi government it seemed pretty obvious from its terms and from the context of the fighting in basra and elsewhere that prime minister nouri al maliki had been humiliated in this confrontation _meta_end_dot_

 at first however the traditional news media adopted the spin coming from the iraqi and american governments that the truce amounted to a victory of sorts for maliki in his decisive and final battle against sadr s militia _meta_end_dot_

 slowly the american media came to realize that the victory might be a tad ambiguous _meta_end_dot_

 then came detailed reports of the stunning desertion rate among iraqi forces sent to basra perhaps as high as _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 any remaining ambiguity has now evaporated in the mesopotamian sun these arrests had provoked the unrest before maliki s attempt to clamp down in basra _meta_end_dot_

 sadr had demanded an end to them in his ceasefire proposal _meta_end_dot_

 with an empty show of bravado maliki later hinted that the arrests would continue unabated _meta_end_dot_

 now he has crumbled completely _meta_end_dot_

 this is the leader whom george bush backed as the man to unify and stabilize iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sad commentary on bush s acumen of course _meta_end_dot_

 less noticed perhaps is that maliki is also the guy who will play a big role in john mccain s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has premised his entire foreign policy on the argument that the us cannot ever allow a power vacuum to emerge in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 maliki is a walking talking power vacuum _meta_end_dot_

 thus it s telling that the iraqi prime minister s name has all but disappeared from mccain s campaign website during _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain was occasionally willing to criticize maliki s record in public but once the mccain surge began it became expedient to stick to praising the iraqi prime minister for every modest sign of progress _meta_end_dot_

 there were frequent references to maliki in _meta_number_ref_ at mccain s website _meta_end_dot_

 as the presidential campaign heats up then it will be interesting to see the extent to which mccain tries to distance himself from an iraqi leader upon whose incompetence so much depends _meta_end_dot_
