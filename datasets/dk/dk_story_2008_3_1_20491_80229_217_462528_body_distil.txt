  last year the internet buzzed okay bad pun with the word that bee colonies around the world were falling apart _meta_end_dot_

 while many explanations continue to be put forth for colony collapse disorder there s another creature that lives in huge colonies which are also facing a mysterious and spreading disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the disease has become known as white nose syndrome as many of the dead and dying bats are found with their muzzles frosted by a coating of white fungus _meta_end_dot_

 however it s not clear if the fungus which is of a common variety is actually a part of the disease a symptom of the disease or just an opportunistic fungus that appears on bats that are already ill _meta_end_dot_

 at first a decline in bat populations may not seem all that important _meta_end_dot_

 after all the only time most people encounter a bat is when one makes a home in their attic and the main thoughts people usually have about bats is that they either carry rabies or are somehow determined to entangle themselves in your hair _meta_end_dot_

 but bats who have zero interest in your hair play a vital role in the ecosystem _meta_end_dot_

 most north american bats are insectivores consuming many times their own weight in insects each summer evening _meta_end_dot_

 a fall in bat populations means billions of additional mosquitoes and flies in the environments insects that can spread more disease among other animals man included _meta_end_dot_

 the danger to health and loss of crops represented by increased insect numbers far outweighs the rare cases of disease spread from bat to human _meta_end_dot_

 bats are our friends _meta_end_dot_

 right now the outbreak of white nose syndrome is limited to the northeast but it s already affecting several bat species including the common little brown bat and the endangered indiana bat _meta_end_dot_

 there are disturbing signs that whatever the unknown cause of this disease it is easily spread _meta_end_dot_

 as the weather warms and bat populations migrate across the country the possibility exists for spreading this disease much more widely among bats _meta_end_dot_

 and that would be a real disaster _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the best thing you can do about any bats you encounter _meta_end_question_

 leave them alone _meta_end_dot_

 interacting with bats can stress them very heavily especially in the winter when most bats in north america are snoozing through the cold weather _meta_end_dot_

 waking a bat during its hibernation phase can cause it to expend so much energy that it doesn t have enough stores to last until spring _meta_end_dot_

 so let em sleep and hope that come spring bat noses stay brown or black or gray _meta_end_dot_

 because if they go in large numbers the consequences for everything else are going to be very unpleasant _meta_end_dot_
