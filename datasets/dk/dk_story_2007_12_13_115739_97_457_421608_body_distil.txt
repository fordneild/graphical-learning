  you know capitulating might not be the best way to sell your party as strong and decisive and effective and competent and principled _meta_end_dot_

 as greenwald notes that sort of thing leads to headlines like these the hill can you feel the strong leadership and strength oozing from pelosi as she muzzles obey s efforts at actual leadership _meta_end_question_

 the hill the liberal base _meta_end_question_

 yeah of course we ll be unhappy _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t know if they noticed this but independents went heavy for democrats in _meta_number_ref_ because of promises over iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure why they pretend this is an issue of import to only base democrats _meta_end_dot_

 two theories _meta_number_ref_ it makes it easier for them to justify their capitulation or _meta_number_ref_ they re morons _meta_end_dot_

 cnn bush actually asked for _meta_dollor_ref_ billion this round the other _meta_dollor_ref_ billion would be requested next year _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have offered _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how that is giving bush less than his request _meta_end_dot_

 washington post you d think that for no other reason than pride democrats would decide to fight _meta_end_dot_

 i mean they can t stop telling us how tough they are by voting for let s bomb iraq and let s bomb iran resolutions _meta_end_dot_

 but people then elect them to do such quaint things as lead and fight _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens when they don t _meta_end_question_

 congressional ratings keep tanking we get headlines like these and people think well democrats sure are wimps actually wimp would be an improvement over the word they really use but it s not politically correct so i won t use it _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what it is _meta_end_dot_

 if the public needs to see which party is made up of strong members and which one is chock full of patsies it s not too difficult to figure out _meta_end_dot_

 and the worst part _meta_end_question_

 republicans always knew democrats didn t have the cojones to fight and have sat back and laughed at all the tough talk from reid and pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 that s what they ve become _meta_end_dot_

 a joke _meta_end_dot_

 so all that s left is to see the final hoyer math _meta_end_dot_

 how many millions in pork is the life of each soldier worth to democrats in dc _meta_end_question_

 we know that for republicans our soldiers lives have zero value _meta_end_dot_

 for democrats the hoyer rate appears to be in the _meta_dollor_ref_ million range _meta_end_dot_

 one last point the american people hate bush the most unpopular president since polling began and consider him a weak incompetent sob _meta_end_dot_

 then they see democrats capitulate to him _meta_end_dot_

 so tough _meta_end_exclamation_
