  how fitting that wyoming with a state motto proclaiming equal rights gets to finally play an important role a presidential primary and it s this groundbreaking one _meta_end_dot_

 wyoming takes its nickname and motto from its vaunted history as the first government in the world to grant women the right to vote serve on juries and hold public office and that was before it was even a state _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ wyoming s territorial legislature granted female suffrage by enacting a bill granting wyoming women the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 you might remember that in an effort to be relevant wyoming republicans held their caucus back on january _meta_number_ref_ where a paltry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ participants statewide decided to throw eight of their _meta_number_ref_ delegates to romney _meta_end_dot_

 so much for relevance _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow the state s democrats who make up about a quarter of the state s electorate make the decision of how to allocate their _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 despite being hugely outnumbered in the state the party is gearing up for the kind of overflow caucus response neighboring idaho and colorado experienced on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 about that campaign embrace clinton has an office and five staffers on the ground there bill and chelsea were there yesterday and even hillary will be there today _meta_end_dot_

 not to be outdone obama will be in casper and laramie today _meta_end_dot_

 he s been running radio and newspaper ads geared toward wyoming specific issues like energy development and has the same ground game that gave him such an advantage in idaho and colorado _meta_end_dot_

 the caucuses are limited to registered democrats but apparently there s been some cross over registration by moderate republicans _meta_end_dot_

 wyoming is probably the most extreme example in the mountain west region of the vaunted independence of voters where ticket splitting is just how you vote _meta_end_dot_

 consider this the state has had a democratic governor for _meta_number_ref_ of the last _meta_number_ref_ years three decades that have been unkind to democrats there _meta_end_dot_

 they haven t sent a democrat to congress since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wyoming voters who reelected democratic governor mike sullivan easily in _meta_number_ref_ with _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote sent him to the curb just four years later when he lost by _meta_number_ref_ points to craig thomas for a senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 not that being a democratic governor in wyoming means being a partisan dem _meta_end_dot_

 npr reports this morning that the current dem governor dave freudenthal doesn t particularly like either of the presidential candidates and that they ll have to meet with him in order for him to determine where throws his superdelegate support _meta_end_dot_

 it s apparently good to be king in wyoming once the state finally matters _meta_end_dot_

 this is one caucus state that obama might not steamroller because clinton has apparently caught up on the importance of having a ground game putting actual bodies on the ground and deploying a real retail oriented campaign _meta_end_dot_

 organizing makes all the difference _meta_end_dot_

 it will also be interesting to see the results from this closed caucus all participants have to have been registered as a democrat as of february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama still has the advantage in this state and i expect him to carry it _meta_end_dot_

 but i doubt it will be by the _meta_number_ref_ margin that he carried neighboring idaho _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge for wyoming democrats just as it is for idaho dems will be to capture the enthusiasm of new and reinvigorated wyoming voters in actually being relevant in a presidential campaign and to harness it to carry through november and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 an invigorated and involved democratic base could make this the election that sends blue majority candidate gary trauner to congress _meta_end_dot_
