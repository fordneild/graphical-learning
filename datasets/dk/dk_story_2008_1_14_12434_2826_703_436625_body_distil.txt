  wanker of the year blogosphere division winner john bambenek has topped his crowning achievement _meta_end_dot_

 adam b already gave you what you need to know about how wrong bambo is on the law _meta_end_dot_

 but i just couldn t resist a point by point look at the various and ridiculous wrong turns bambenek made along the way to his audaciously stupid conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 so yes the yo yo who filed the fec complaint against daily kos that was so wholly without merit that the commission actually disposed of it wearing clothespins on their noses no doubt in record time is back again with another publicly financed morons a poppin tm boondoggle a criminal complaint to the michigan attorney general mike cox control yourself beavis alleging that urging democrats to vote for romney in the michigan republican presidential primary constitutes voter fraud _meta_end_dot_

 oh _meta_end_dot_

 my _meta_end_dot_

 god _meta_end_dot_

 will these right wing bootstrappers never tire of making the public pay for their inevitable smackdowns _meta_end_question_

 is this some kind of a weird fetish i just don t understand _meta_end_question_

 surely there are privately financed ways bambenek can come to grips if such were his wont let s say with his hard on for markos no _meta_end_question_

 but bambenek wants none of that _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to do this on your dime _meta_end_dot_

 make the fec waste the time and resources to restate the rules it had already promulgated a year before _meta_end_dot_

 make the michigan attorney general explain that an open primary is _meta_end_dot_

 well open _meta_end_dot_

 all on the taxpayer dime _meta_end_dot_

 what a prince eh _meta_end_question_

 here s the thing it s _meta_end_dot_

 not _meta_end_dot_

 voter _meta_end_dot_

 fraud _meta_end_dot_

 when people entitled by michigan law to participate in elections held at public cost do so under their own names in their assigned polling places and cast just one ballot there s no fraud _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 special note _meta_number_ref_ for the media this case should tell you in no uncertain terms that when wingnuts cry to you about voter fraud and let s be honest they re constantly crying about it they have not a clue in the world what they re talking about and they should be given no more attention than if they d told you they ve got video of elvis descending from a ufo to cast a stretchy sequined ballot _meta_end_dot_

 do not forget this _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing the republicans whine about more annoyingly or more frequently these days than voter fraud and here they are once again demonstrating embarrassingly for all to see that all they can really hope for is for the media not to ask any questions when they slap that oh so scary sounding label on _meta_end_dot_

 well whatever the hell they happen to have at hand _meta_end_dot_

 do not believe republican crocodile tears about voter fraud _meta_end_dot_

 they don t know what it is _meta_end_dot_

 so bambenek is just stupid right _meta_end_question_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 bambenek is spectacularly stupid _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 here s a point by point rundown of the idiocy and a second special note for the media after the break _meta_end_dot_
