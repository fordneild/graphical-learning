  the supreme court has dealt a blow to katrina survivors by siding with insurance companies and denying the claims of flood victims who were seeking compensation _meta_end_dot_

 with the ruling the court rejected _meta_number_ref_ cases brought by individuals and business including xavier university it comes as no surprise that this court would side with big money insurance companies _meta_end_dot_

 that wasn t the only bad news from the supreme court today _meta_end_dot_

 they also announced a ruling against the aclu and its domestic spying case again it is painfully clear that if the opportunity arises the highest priority for the next democratic administration must be balancing the court _meta_end_dot_

 rulings like this make me livid that alito was confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 what in the hell was congress thinking _meta_end_question_

 his confirmation is without a doubt one of the single greatest failures of our democratic representatives _meta_end_dot_

 on the off chance that mccain actually won the general election and had the opportunity to appoint another right wing judge this court may be shifted beyond repair for generations _meta_end_dot_

 if that doesn t make you want to gotv for democrats this fall i m not sure what will _meta_end_dot_

 update a reminder that mcjoan has much more on the aclu ruling in her post below _meta_end_dot_
