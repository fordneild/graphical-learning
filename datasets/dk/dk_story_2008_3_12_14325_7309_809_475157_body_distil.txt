  here we go again _meta_end_dot_

 first of all it s funny that he says that obama is winning the democratic process but that it s irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 nice framing there harold _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that here s the clinton campaign once again automatically writing off entire swaths of the country _meta_end_dot_

 should we write off all those states _meta_end_question_

 north carolina and nebraska can absolutely be competitive _meta_end_dot_

 according to surveyusa north carolina is currently only a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain state against obama _meta_end_dot_

 and given the torrid growth of the state s research triangle the democratic gains in the state s _meta_number_ref_ mid term elections at both the state and federal levels and the overall negative climate for republicans nc is _absolutely_ in play _meta_end_dot_

 even clinton s _meta_number_ref_ point deficit in the state in that susa poll suggests that it is the case _meta_end_dot_

 remember _meta_number_ref_ swing states missouri was lost by seven washington was won by seven florida was lost by five and so on _meta_end_dot_

 a minus eight deficit absolutely puts a state in play and that the clinton campaign would insult a state as irrelevant at this junction is shocking and counterproductive yet more evidence that the clinton campaign is intent on waging last cycle s battles rather than looking toward a map changing future _meta_end_dot_

 then there s nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 believe it or not nebraska has always been in play because it splits its electoral votes by congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the kerry campaign made an unsuccessful play for some of those evs _meta_end_dot_

 that susa poll shows clinton losing nebraska badly but obama surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 picks up two of the state s five evs and trails narrowly statewide _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in crashing the gate jerome armstrong and i write the clinton campaign may not have bob shrum in its ranks but mark penn harold ickes and the rest of that gang seem just as committed as ever to their shrinking pool of swing states _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton gang is doing what mark warner decries minimizing belittling and ignoring southern and western red states and claiming that the only states that matter are predictably the states that mattered last election ohio and florida _meta_end_dot_

 but that s the old map and it s an obsolete one _meta_end_dot_

 one campaign is irrationally attached to that old map while the other is focused on being a map changer spurring democratic victories in unexpected places and generating a true national mandate for change _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to see which campaign is which _meta_end_dot_
