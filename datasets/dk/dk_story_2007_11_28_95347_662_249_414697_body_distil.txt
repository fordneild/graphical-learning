  i know hillary s opponents are jumping on zogby interactive s latest poll showing hillary doing substantially poorer than her opponents in head to head matchups than her opponents _meta_end_dot_

 let me make this as clear as possible zogby interactive polls are junk _meta_end_dot_

 they are about as solid as the daily kos cattle call polls would be if we were trying to claim the community represented all democrats _meta_end_dot_

 witness this little bit of disclaimer how a poll that is essentially a web poll can be considered credible is beyond me _meta_end_dot_

 but you don t have to take my word for it _meta_end_dot_

 look at how poorly the zogby interactive poll performed in _meta_number_ref_ after a disastrous debut in _meta_number_ref_ seriously zogby polls suck _meta_end_dot_

 yet according to google news right now the hillary loses against all republicans in the general poll has been cited by over _meta_number_ref_ media while the far more respectable gallup effort which shows that hillary in fact beats them all has been far less reported _meta_end_dot_

 the media has its agenda which right now is the hillary is fading narrative _meta_end_dot_

 the hard core supporters of the other democratic primary candidates have their agenda to raise bullshit electability arguments against hillary _meta_end_dot_

 and those of us who remain reality based and dispassionate throughout this all can only shake our heads at the credence being put in a discredited shill of a pollster _meta_end_dot_

 update pollster com actually it s a perfect explanation _meta_end_dot_

 you see hillary s results in the dkos straw poll _meta_end_question_

 in all internet polls she far underperforms her real world numbers _meta_end_dot_

 update ii steve singiser had similar thoughts last night _meta_end_dot_
