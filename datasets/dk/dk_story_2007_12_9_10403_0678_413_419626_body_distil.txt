  after an unnecessary invasion of mesopotamia had been ginned up through the most frank and shameless manipulation of foreign intelligence the american public was more than a little ready for greater transparency in us intelligence agencies _meta_end_dot_

 when nominated to head the cia michael hayden promised a new era of openness at the agency a promise he s maintained in public appearances and one he occasionally delivered on _meta_end_dot_

 a new era of transparency is dawning you might say _meta_end_dot_

 so what is the news this week in glasnost _meta_end_question_

 a hhh it was a good week indeed _meta_end_dot_

 we learned from mr _meta_end_dot_

 secrecy himself dick cheney that the spirit of glasnost has seeped all the way to the top of the administration _meta_end_dot_

 a heart felt yearning for transparency it turns out and nothing else accounts for the publication of the key judgments of the iranian nie _meta_end_dot_

 but come to think of it there was just one other reason for publishing the document hence the noble spirit of glasnost does have another more cynical face _meta_end_dot_

 but fortunately for democratic society since everything leaks by that logic everything that is controversial will have to be published _meta_end_dot_

 that makes it a very good week indeed for glasnost _meta_end_dot_

 s teven aftergood however kill joy that he is has some bad news about the march of progress _meta_end_dot_

 the cia has decided that it s too much work to keep declassifying documents at the current pace and the agency doesn t intend to allow other federal agencies to step in and help expedite things either _meta_end_dot_

 well that opens the way to a multitude of abuses doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 b ut even a kill joy like steve couldn t find anything to complain about in the release of four new cia histories of us clandestine services _meta_end_dot_

 these cover operations in korea cuba and berlin as well as the evolution of ground paramilitary activities in the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 o r to be more precise aftergood welcomed their release until with a single day s research he found conclusive evidence that the cia bungled the declassification of official histories _meta_end_dot_

 for example in its history of the berlin tunnel the cia attempted to withhold portions of that report as classified even though they had previously been released the spirit of glasnost seeps upward only ever so slowly _meta_end_dot_
