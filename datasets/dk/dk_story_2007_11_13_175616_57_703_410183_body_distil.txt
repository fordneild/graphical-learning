 they are extending the _meta_number_ref_ state strategy to include us the bloggers at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 from their materials in addition the dncc will provide an as of yet undetermined number of credentials for national political bloggers and niche bloggers whose main focus is not politics but who do write about politics or issues around politics _meta_end_dot_

 this pool will also be available to video bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 group state or local blogs can apply for one credential for the site and share it among writers if more than one wants to attend the convention _meta_end_dot_

 they re opening up their space as a home away from home for bloggers with all the resources we could possibly need _meta_end_dot_

 in the special breakout session for bloggers we stressed that the state and local bloggers particularly need to have floor access to be able to spend time with their states delegations and that all bloggers need to be credentialed for not only the convention floor but for the meetings that take place around the convention where some of the real news will be happening _meta_end_dot_

 additionally we pointed out how critical it is that traditional media who happen to also have blogs should not be considered part of the blogger pool when it comes to credentialling credentials are a very limited resource and if the dnc really wants to have alternative voices reporting on the convention the aim of having so many of us there then they should reserve all of the blogging credentials for those who can t get them as standard press _meta_end_dot_

 the colorado bloggers were well represented at the walk through and are already planning their host role _meta_end_dot_
