  some more analysis on tomorrow s special election in illinois where the republicans are getting so desperate they re breaking house rules to try and keep the seat from flipping blue _meta_end_dot_

 susang tomorrow s the big day in illinois _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 the polls are good and the media is savaging jim oberweis _meta_end_dot_

 this time it is over an oberweis ad which depicted four families which were according to oberweis going to be leveled by hateful bill foster s hateful tax hikes _meta_end_dot_

 only thing is they didn t exist oberweis response _meta_end_question_

 it s hard work finding real live people _meta_end_dot_

 democrat bill foster appears to have the momentum going into the election which has led both cq politics and rothenberg to change their ranking of this race to toss up no clear favorite _meta_end_dot_

 again this seat would be a major coup for democrats heading into election season _meta_end_dot_

 from cq the wild card in this race will be turnout i don t think anyone is quite certain what to expect from a saturday special election _meta_end_dot_

 this being a republican district i think lower turnout should favor republican jim oberweis so every vote counts _meta_end_dot_

 with just a day left the campaigning is at fever pitch _meta_end_dot_

 here s the dccc s latest ad on oberweis dishonest campaign tactics needless to say oberweis didn t care for the ad _meta_end_dot_

 he couldn t really think of a good reason to complain though so he has his company oberweis dairy file suit against the dccc alleging that their ads were hurting business _meta_end_dot_

 now this has backfired as the dccc has filed an fec complaint against the oberweis campaign for so using the resources of one s business to benefit one s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter how much oberweis screws up though if we can t get voters out to the polls tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 so help out at blue majority or visit foster s website for information on volunteering _meta_end_dot_
