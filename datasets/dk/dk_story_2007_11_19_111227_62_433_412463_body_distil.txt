  now don t be too shocked as the cowardly democratic senate caucus weighs caving on iraq timeline a timeline remember that isn t even binding _meta_end_dot_

 just a goal _meta_end_dot_

 a few days ago we had this now we have this i wrote in newsweek i guess reid and the senate caucus have chosen weakness and unpopularity _meta_end_dot_

 they curiously want to own this war along with the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi and the house are still standing firm on this and they alone could put an end to this insanity _meta_end_dot_

 reid and the senate are hopeless on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 they really are too weak to stand for what s right and popular _meta_end_dot_

 so it s up to the house to make its stand _meta_end_dot_
