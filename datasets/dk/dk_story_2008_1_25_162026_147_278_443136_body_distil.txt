  last night in the republican debate tim russert asked john mccain about a statement he d made mccain pretended he d never said any such thing except that he had said it _meta_end_dot_

 russert plucked the statement from this _meta_number_ref_ puff piece on mccain in the wsj you ll probably find that information about mccain s economic advisors less reassuring than reporter stephen moore did _meta_end_dot_

 in any case mccain has said similar things about his economic ignorance several times over several years and as recently as last month _meta_end_dot_

 his admissions of ignorance are well known and sometimes quite spectacular _meta_end_dot_

 so just another case of mccain the liar _meta_end_dot_

 h ow contentedly american journalists suck at the teat of that mother of all political myths john mccain the straight talker _meta_end_dot_

 disgusting sure particularly if you have any direct experience of mccain the liar as i do _meta_end_dot_

 take for example this slobbering interview by michele norris on npr recently _meta_end_dot_

 she spits up all over herself trying to portray a simple opinion about economics as emblematic of mccain s honesty and candor assuming these things as if they were fact rather than journalistic fictions damned you senator admit it already you re politically courageous _meta_end_dot_

 why don t you stop being so evasive and fess up to being a straight talker _meta_end_question_

 standing up to voters _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_exclamation_

 truly a pathetic performance but characteristic of so much of the reporting on mccain by american journalists _meta_end_dot_

 for example in this report from last june we learned that mccain s exposure as a corrupt hack during the savings and loan crisis of the late _meta_number_ref_s led no not to jail time get a hold of yourself _meta_end_dot_

 his exposure as a crook led to the straight talking politician we know today _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 sure it was and the shame of being exposed as a politician on the make turned mccain into the truthiest of truth tellers _meta_end_dot_

 a miraculous transformation practically overnight from cheap crook to straight shooter _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that mccain continues to lie about his role in the savings and loan scandal and avoids taking responsibility for the financial wreckage he helped to create nor that he continues to exploit his influence to benefit campaign contributors _meta_end_dot_

 no your role as a patriotic american reporter is to convince the public to overlook all the evidence of mccain s long tawdry record of deception and disingenuousness _meta_end_dot_

 i ll never buy what they re selling though since i ve seen mccain in action _meta_end_dot_

 he s a liar s liar _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when i was teaching at the us naval academy it was being rocked by a series of scandals related to a failure in leadership at the academy _meta_end_dot_

 this included the biggest cheating scandal in the academy s history _meta_end_dot_

 very unusually members of the board of visitors were invited to meet with faculty in early june of _meta_number_ref_ to discuss the crisis _meta_end_dot_

 mccain went along to this closed meeting and repeatedly expressed grave concern about what he was being told of the circumstances behind the scandals _meta_end_dot_

 after then going to talk to the academy superintendent mccain emerged to discuss the faculty meeting with reporters who d been excluded _meta_end_dot_

 mccain told the reporters that all the complaints he d heard were trivial the opposite of what he d just said to us _meta_end_dot_

 joanna daemmrich the baltimore sun reporter who asked me for a response to his comments didn t appear to fall for mccain s fake candor _meta_end_dot_

 and neither should you _meta_end_dot_
