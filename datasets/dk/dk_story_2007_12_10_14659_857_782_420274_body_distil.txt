  the edwards campaign asked the fec whether contributions donated via actblue could be counted for matching grant purposes _meta_end_dot_

 adam bonin who represents this site on regulatory matters explained the situation a few weeks ago now common sense would dictate that this law was enacted decades ago to prevent the matching of illegal funds _meta_end_dot_

 as the edwards campaign argued pdf so the fec has two ways to go be literal and apply the law in a way it was never intended to be applied or work with the intent of the law and carve out an exception for pacs like actblue which don t do their own fundraising but rather facilitate that of regular small dollar donors all over the country _meta_end_dot_

 well the initial word out of the fec in a draft opinion is that they re going the literal route pdf link fixed _meta_end_dot_

 they re saying that donations through actblue are not matchable for public financing purposes a patently ridiculous conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 people have a week to provide comments to the fec and i have asked bonin to draft a comment on behalf of daily kos asking the fec to toss this draft for a more common sensical approach _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who cares about this issue can do the same people are trying to set up an email address as well _meta_end_dot_

 note that the fec has proven itself a very reasonable agency _meta_end_dot_

 their draft report on blogger regulation was far more restrictive than their ultimate decision so they are eager to be educated by the public and willing to let that feedback influence their ultimate decisions _meta_end_dot_

 the public financing system is designed to let campaigns match small dollar contributions from supporters _meta_end_dot_

 actblue helps facilitate those small dollar contributions _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason contributions via actblue should not count for public financing purposes _meta_end_dot_

 update and here s the email address for public comments mary dove at mdove fec gov _meta_end_dot_
