  having followed this story closely here since this sat sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ post i have been thinking about the state of play at the moment with schip and where we go from here politically _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ summary is from kaisernetwork org so without defending or piling on the democrats in congress who are having issues with caving on iraq and perhaps a few other items i would have been happier with more public votes _meta_end_dot_

 however reality sometimes intrudes and here are some realities and another reminder of the big picture and longer term if we want real reforms passed in health care gop rejection doesn t mean there s auto approval of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 they still need to bring something to the table to gain the support they need to win _meta_end_dot_

 still i remain optimistic on all counts and look forward to november _meta_number_ref_ which can t come a moment too soon _meta_end_dot_
