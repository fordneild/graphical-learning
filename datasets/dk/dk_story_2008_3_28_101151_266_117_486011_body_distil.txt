  last week it was bill richardson coming close to saying hillary clinton should recognize what has been clear for over a month she can t win and barack obama will be our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 last night and this morning dnc chair howard dean has been making the rounds declaring that he d like to see the contest for the democratic nomination end by july _meta_number_ref_st last night he gave an interview to the associated press he didn t give many more details this morning but he did reinforce his commitment to ending the contest no later than july _meta_number_ref_st here s what he said on the cbs early show on abc s good morning america and on cnn he said he thought the problems with the michigan and florida delegations would be worked out before the convention the traditional news media is finally acknowledging that hillary clinton can t win we will see more folks like patrick leahy calling on clinton to withdraw from the race and endorse barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 obama will continue to pick up big endorsements like today s endorsement by pennsylvania senator bob casey _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope that sometime soon the candidate whose campaign was based on the assumption of inevitability will see that it s inevitable that barack obama will be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 update apparently i wasn t sufficiently explicit about the ramifications of dean s declaration _meta_end_dot_

 he is blocking clinton s only remaining path to the nomination which is to wait for obama to self destruct _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows there s no way that clinton will take the lead among pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton hopes to drag out the convention on the minuscule chance that delegates pledged as well as unpledged will conclude that obama can t win the general and then flock to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 dean just said no you re not hanging around we re getting behind the winner no later than july and that he d be fine with getting it settled in june _meta_end_dot_
