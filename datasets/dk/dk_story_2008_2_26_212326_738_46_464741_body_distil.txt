  watching clinton s posture as she listens to obama s last answer she looks defeated to me _meta_end_dot_

 she s just not carrying as much energy and focus in the lines of her body and face when she s not talking _meta_end_dot_

 and i think that s the story of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 i do think the moderation was at issue but i also think obama took this one on the merits in part because he carried in the energy and confidence of someone who s on an electoral roll _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think _meta_end_question_
