 across america people were opening their newspapers to read about bush s impending war in afghanistan or maybe another article about the september _meta_number_ref_ terrorist attacks _meta_end_dot_

 chances are most only gave the following article a brief glance florida man dies of rare form of anthrax of course in light of the september _meta_number_ref_ attacks the word terrorism was whispered but public health officials firmly stated that did not yet know how the man had contracted the disease _meta_end_dot_

 october _meta_number_ref_ the fbi had taken over the case which was now making front page news by october _meta_number_ref_ three people had died in florida _meta_end_dot_

 on october _meta_number_ref_ the news broke that an nbc employee in new york had contracted anthrax anthrax case confirmed in new york three days later headlines across the nation announced anthrax threat comes to congress until _meta_number_ref_ there had only been _meta_number_ref_ fatal cases of pulmonary anthrax in the us in the past _meta_number_ref_ years the _meta_number_ref_ fatal cases in _meta_number_ref_ were the first in us history caused by an intentional release of anthrax _meta_end_dot_

 eventually public health officials were able to determine that seven anthrax laden letters were were mailed four were opened _meta_end_dot_

 americans waited on the edge of their seats for the fbi to announce that they d caught the culprit or culprits _meta_end_dot_

 publicly it looks like they hit some rough spots early on investigators argued about the possible source of the anthrax who might have formulated the weapon _meta_end_question_

 was it weaponized _meta_end_question_

 military grade _meta_end_question_

 were the perpetrator s former us military lab researcher s or maybe just researcher s in a civilian lab _meta_end_question_

 the bush administration immediately tried to pin it on saddam of course in any case it was agreed that the anthrax was energetic and professionally done became airborne easily and was therefore readily inhaled and effective as a weapon _meta_end_dot_

 five years and many conspiracy theories later the feds gave their last update _meta_end_dot_

 they said that they re still on the case and that it has high priority _meta_end_dot_

 however yesterday fox news claims to have obtained an email exchanged between us army scientists regarding about four possible suspects this is not news _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion it s only slightly more specific than any previous knowledge gained from the investigation which has been plagued with problems and scientific disagreements from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 and even though the fbi publicly chose to focus on one person of interest it has been implied that there were multiple suspects since the beginning of the investigation as richard preston describes in his book the demon in the freezer _meta_end_dot_

 preston quotes a conversation he had with a forensic microbiologist who is also a former fbi agent fox may think they have a scoop but their article and most likely the email is essentially a re hash of old speculation and is only slightly more specific than the musings of preston s source _meta_end_dot_
