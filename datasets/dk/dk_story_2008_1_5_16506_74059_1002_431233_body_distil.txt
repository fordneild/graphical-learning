  and now a word not about candidates but about campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 gary langer the pollster guru at abc has a few harsh words about another pollster this one working for one of the campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 keep this in mind the des moines register poll and the pollster j _meta_end_dot_

 anne selzer did a fair minded honest and terrific job and came under a lot of flak for it _meta_end_dot_

 of particular interest was the behavior of this pollster in the aftermath one mark penn bolded mine and don t assume all pollsters do this either _meta_end_dot_

 langer has his own take on it and i have mine _meta_end_dot_

 mine is a good deal less charitable to penn _meta_end_dot_
