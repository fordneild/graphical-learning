  the short answer is it s harry reid s fault _meta_end_dot_

 but let me back up a bit _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times published an important article february _meta_number_ref_ on the fears that many americans have about seeking out genetic testing for disease _meta_end_dot_

 a positive test for a pre disposition to a genetically based disease could lead to higher health insurance premiums a loss of coverage altogether or even the loss of a job _meta_end_dot_

 it s a scary situation for anyone especially for those who have family histories of such illnesses _meta_end_dot_

 do you get tested and put your healthcare and job at risk _meta_end_question_

 or avoid testing and of course put your very health at risk _meta_end_question_

 fortunately rep _meta_end_dot_

 louise slaughter has a solution at least until we have universal healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 after twelve years of being rebuffed by recidivist republicans rep _meta_end_dot_

 slaughter was finally able to pass the genetic information nondiscrimination act aka gina after democrats re took the house last year _meta_end_dot_

 as she explained at the time the bill passed overwhelmingly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 everyone assumed that passage in the senate would be a cakewalk a similar bill had been approved in that body twice before and even president bush said he would sign it _meta_end_dot_

 but that was until sen _meta_end_dot_

 tom coburn s ugly mug showed up on the scene _meta_end_dot_

 coburn actually voted for gina in _meta_number_ref_ yet now he s placed a hold on the bill _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 slaughter says that coburn s excuses for his hold don t make sense but what makes even less sense is harry reid s respect for that hold _meta_end_dot_

 a hold as we well know simply means that the senator placing it intends to or at least claims he or she will filibuster the bill if it s brought to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 the surest way to test the sincerity of such a claim is for the majority leader in this case reid to actually go ahead and force a vote on the bill _meta_end_dot_

 seeing as the _meta_number_ref_ version of gina passed by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there s no way coburn could muster _meta_number_ref_ other republicans to sustain his filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 so why the hell is harry reid honoring this sure to fail hold _meta_end_question_

 there is no reason that i can discern _meta_end_dot_

 we can t even pretend that reid is doing this out of a too great fealty to senate tradition we are all too familiar by now with his ugly history of ignoring holds placed by fellow democrats such as those placed by ron wyden and chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 if reid has no problems running roughshod over the perogatives of members of his own caucus then surely he can disregard coburn s abusive and senseless hold as well _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a reflexive reid basher but there is no justification for this _meta_end_dot_

 i expect the tom coburns of the world to be irredeemable jerks _meta_end_dot_

 and i expect our party s senate majority leader to recognize that and govern accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 reid needs to steamroll coburn s hold immediately _meta_end_dot_

 countless americans who wrongly are forced to live in fear of the consequences of genetic testing deserve no less _meta_end_dot_
