 bush in _meta_number_ref_ the new york times despite all the administration s crowing about the supposed success of the surge which came too late to prevent most of the ethnic cleansing and the lower casualty rates may be more a result of a possible respite by sectarian forces as the prepare for heightened actions against each other it s clear there s been no serious political progress it s a familiar story and not just in iraq maybe the military should make sure all it s officers see the godfather ii the problem in both places is not that we don t have well trained and effective soldiers on the ground although we have far too few in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that the our military can t force domestic political cooperation and harmony especially if the local population doesn t feel safe as just about anyone reading this knows much of this could have been prevented _meta_end_dot_

 if the administration hadn t diverted attention and resources away from afghanistan in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ we might have been able to help the afghans achieve a sufficient degree of security and stability to begin to build the institutions of a civil society and foster a viable state _meta_end_dot_

 and if there was ever an opportunity to achieve stability and security in post saddam iraq which is unlikely that opportunity was squandered in the chaos immediately after the collapse of the iraqi army and our subsequent bungled occupation in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the post article points out that bush has mostly stopped mentioning afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that the administration has now run out of ideas for afghanistan and since it was never central to their long term dreams and doesn t have any oil or natural gas they apparently don t feel any need to pitch reasons to have hope for the future _meta_end_dot_

 for iraq now it looks like the administration will ask everyone to expect the next breakthrough to come following provincial elections which may or may not happen by the end of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in other words more of the same with the administration trying to leave the mess to whoever takes over the white house in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
