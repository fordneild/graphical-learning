  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 as you ve no doubt noticed by their purchase of twenty billion banner ads sunday night hbo starts airing a seven part miniseries provocatively titled john f_meta_beep_ref_ing adams _meta_end_dot_

 based on david mccullough s best selling book john adams now a major hbo miniseries the production shines a _meta_number_ref_ million dollar spotlight on our grumpiest founding father _meta_end_dot_

 the hollywood reporter says it s worth a look the older i get i turn _meta_number_ref_ in august the more i marvel at the intestinal fortitude it took for adams and his band of rebels to break away from england form a new country and steer it in the right direction during those wobbly first years _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure i could imagine many of our leaders today taking those kinds of risks and that is to their great shame _meta_end_dot_

 adams and the other founding fathers did the hard part they put their necks on the line _meta_end_dot_

 as ben franklin said we must hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately had things gone even a bit differently today we might be speaking with british accents and reading about the failed colonial rebellion in history books _meta_end_dot_

 even worse kidney pudding would still be a regular staple on the dinner table _meta_end_dot_

 for this alone adams deserves our thanks _meta_end_dot_

 but tsk tsk for signing the alien and sedition acts you cur as a special bonus following sunday s broadcast hbo will host a forum with geraldine ferraro who will explain that john adams was only able to get to this point because he was lucky enough to be rotund your west coast friendly edition of cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
