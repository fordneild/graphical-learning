  it s important to remember that the new hampshire democratic party s _meta_number_ref_ club dinner is an annual fundraising event _meta_end_dot_

 it s attended by people who have paid _meta_dollor_ref_ or more to attend an nhdp fundraiser and people who have been given tickets by campaigns and the like _meta_end_dot_

 in other words dedicated democratic activists the vast majority of whom are committed to a candidate when they walk in _meta_end_dot_

 so responses to the candidate speeches there are indicative of organization as much as of organic support _meta_end_dot_

 which campaign got the most supporters to turn out _meta_end_question_

 which campaign got signs into its supporters hands _meta_end_question_

 last night the dominant campaign on both organization and organic enthusiasm was obama s _meta_end_dot_

 early in the evening as various party officials and state politicians spoke occasionally the room would suddenly be filled with waving obama signs _meta_end_dot_

 it was like nobody else had supporters in the room _meta_end_dot_

 when clinton spoke you realized she did have supporters there and quite a lot of them _meta_end_dot_

 they cheered enthusiastically and waved the signs they hadn t seen fit to take out at any earlier point _meta_end_dot_

 at that point advantage obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 whether clinton s supporters were instructed to hold their sign waving for her appearance or they just weren t that worked up it meant that through an hour and a half of speeches obama s supporters were the only visible ones _meta_end_dot_

 clinton gets what i d say was a strong initial reception _meta_end_dot_

 swampland says she was booed twice during her speech and someone i know watching c span heard it at least once _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s about where the booers were in relation to the mikes because i didn t hear it _meta_end_dot_

 what i did hear was that when she said that the question was who would be the best president obama supporters began chanting obama as they waved their signs _meta_end_dot_

 their chant overpowered clinton supporters and round o signs clearly outnumbered rectangular clinton ones _meta_end_dot_

 but when bill richardson finishes speaking and the crowd knows that obama is next on the program the room just changes _meta_end_dot_

 i was expecting the biggest response of the evening but one measured on the same scale _meta_end_dot_

 this is a whole different scale _meta_end_dot_

 katharine q _meta_end_dot_

 seelye at the nyt s caucus blog barack obama s campaign won the organization battle at the _meta_number_ref_ club _meta_end_dot_

 they got signs into his supporters hands and must have issued instructions to not save the sign waving for his speech _meta_end_dot_

 so visibility through the night was theirs _meta_end_dot_

 but the swell and crackle of energy in the room when he spoke _meta_end_question_

 that was organic and it was overwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 every time obama started to lose me with a line i ve heard one time too many this long campaign season the crowd would bring me back in _meta_end_dot_

 on the shuttle back to the parking lot it s impossible not to notice that obama s supporters are decades younger than those of other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and i think obama may not be my favorite on a policy level his speeches may often leave me cold but he could be a transformative candidate and president _meta_end_dot_
