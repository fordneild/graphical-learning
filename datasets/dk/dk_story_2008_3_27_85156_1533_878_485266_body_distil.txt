  don t you just hate it when people pick on john mccain by repeating what he actually said _meta_end_question_

 by god the press sure does _meta_end_dot_

 well that s clearly not fair _meta_end_dot_

 a hundred years isn t actually endless _meta_end_dot_

 and even ten million years is not limitless that s especially true when you consider that at current rates in ten million years us losses alone would exceed the total population of the earth _meta_end_dot_

 so fighting is bound to end way sooner than that _meta_end_dot_

 so treating it as if mccain said we would be there forever is just wrong _meta_end_dot_

 in fact using anything mccain said is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 see there _meta_end_question_

 mccain was speaking hypothetically he said it cavaleirly and most importantly the person he was talking to was a self described democrat so none of it counts _meta_end_dot_
