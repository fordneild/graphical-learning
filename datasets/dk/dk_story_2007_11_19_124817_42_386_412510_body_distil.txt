  well we know how fridays are the best days to dump bad news on the public _meta_end_dot_

 and last friday was no different _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason why lipinski would want to make this as low profile as possible as his corruption and that of his father s continues to garner brutal headlines _meta_end_dot_

 now we ve made lots of noise about the fake campaigns the lipinski daley machine has generated to split the anti lipinski vote _meta_end_dot_

 palos hills mayor jerry bennet a lipinski ally is supposedly running a legit race _meta_end_dot_

 yet he endorsed lipinski two years ago an endorsement that has been reposted on lipinski s new and updated campaign site bennett who continues to insist that he s not a puppet of the corrupt lipinski re election machine has still refused to publicly call for lipinski to remove that endorsement from his website _meta_end_dot_

 but in any case you want to boil this race down to its core and why it s important to we do whatever we can to rid ourselves of lipinski _meta_end_question_

 i ll cede to the capitol fax blog which has the most concise summary i ve read thus far crazy stuff no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 we re lucky that we have mark pera taking lipinski on _meta_end_dot_
