 on friday august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the line of customers at the gigantic liquor mart in the city where i was then living wound out the doors into the parking lot onto the sidewalk and down the block _meta_end_dot_

 the sweet aroma of cannabis wafted about here and there _meta_end_dot_

 but the cops who had been hastily called to keep order made no move to snuff it _meta_end_dot_

 the store was already out of kegs and the shelves of cheaper wines and some of the hard stuff were depleting rapidly _meta_end_dot_

 the night before richard milhous nixon _meta_number_ref_th president of the united states facing almost certain conviction if he were impeached had announced to the world that he would resign at noon the following day _meta_end_dot_

 we were preparing for a glorious party that would rage all weekend _meta_end_dot_

 after two years of probing journalism and investigations by the fbi senate watergate committee and house judiciary committee the white house had been shown to be behind massive criminality including break ins wiretapping of citizens and the media hush money pay offs and conspiracies to cover up these and other crimes as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and actual obstruction of justice _meta_end_dot_

 after months of jettisoning staff members and repeatedly denying his personal involvement nixon was heard conspiring in some of these matters on secret white house tape recordings he had sought to keep out of investigators hands until the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court unanimously ruled he must surrender them _meta_end_dot_

 the delight in that liquor store line was palpable _meta_end_dot_

 after five and a half years of what we progressives viewed as the nixon nightmare we were just an hour away from our deliverance _meta_end_dot_

 in those days before ubiquitous public television screens much less wi fi we heard via portable radio the announcement of his departure from the white house lawn on army one _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd s cheers went on in waves for several minutes _meta_end_dot_

 as noted the party lasted from then until late sunday night _meta_end_dot_

 of course president ford pardoned nixon a month later dashing our hopes that he might actually be tried for his criminality _meta_end_dot_

 and while democrats massacred republicans in the _meta_number_ref_ congressional elections it wasn t so very long before ronald reagan was in the white house initiating a quarter century of dismantling the fdr legacy and adopting some of the ideas of what michael harrington had in _meta_number_ref_ labeled the socialists for nixon before they came fully out of the shadows neoconservatives _meta_end_dot_

 although the iran contra scandal nicked a few of that crew notably elliott abrams nobody went to prison thanks to george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s pardons _meta_end_dot_

 reagan s tepid mea culpa delivered without the threat of impeachment from an even more tepid congress was certainly no resignation speech _meta_end_dot_

 so here we are two decades down the road from reagan ruled by a regime responsible for a colossal roster of social economic diplomatic and military destruction facing a global climate crisis worsened by malignant denial and an energy crisis worsened by shameless cronyism underpinned by a brazenly imperialist foreign policy based on american exceptionalism and constitution shredding _meta_end_dot_

 and every bit of it sculpted by a fearmongering governance that would make big brother envious and probably have a congressman richard nixon demanding that impeachment articles be drawn up _meta_end_dot_

 no such luck with the current congress although a few brave souls thank you dennis kucinich have been willing to make the case and push it forward despite the broad resistance of most of their fellow representatives and many rank and file progressives _meta_end_dot_

 too risky they say _meta_end_dot_

 too distracting _meta_end_dot_

 too late _meta_end_dot_

 and now the congress is off for a two week vacation making it ever more likely that impeachment of richard bruce cheney and or george walker bush will never get a hearing _meta_end_dot_

 no chance to finally see that smirk wiped off mister bush s face or to deepen cheney s grimace as they depart in shame or handcuffs _meta_end_dot_

 instead on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ these two war criminals will be seated in places of honor when the new president takes the oath of office that these two men mouthed and then spent two full terms spitting on at every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 no ignominious last rides to the airport in helicopters for them _meta_end_dot_

 certainly no trips to leavenworth _meta_end_dot_

 the question is will there be long lines at the liquor mart for us _meta_end_question_

 will january _meta_number_ref_ just _meta_number_ref_ months from now offer progressives good reason for a hearty party _meta_end_question_

 when and of course if a democrat steps up as president to the podium that day we certainly know the speech will be better than any we ve heard from that quarter in the past eight years _meta_end_dot_

 we know we can stop holding our breath for fear one of the aging moderates on the supreme court will die _meta_end_dot_

 we know we ll see more attention paid to science fewer people who hate government regulation appointed as government regulators an end to disdain for environmentalists the crushing of reactionary federal policy on stem cell research some movement in the direction of covering everyone s health care needs the probable end to atrocities such as the guant namo detention camp reform or demolition of no child left behind and a new energy policy in which somebody besides the oil giants have a say _meta_end_dot_

 maybe even a new direction in the fair trade vs _meta_end_dot_

 free trade debate _meta_end_dot_

 all good reasons for a hoorah maybe even a toast _meta_end_dot_

 but i for one won t be partying january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i m saving that for the end of that legendary first _meta_number_ref_ days first instituted by fdr _meta_end_dot_

 or longer _meta_end_dot_

 until i see the new president seek a gutting of the patriot act _meta_end_dot_

 until domestic spying is controlled by a judicial arrangement far more constraining than the rubber stamp operation begun _meta_number_ref_ years ago after the church committee dug into the criminality of u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence operations _meta_end_dot_

 until torture in all its forms is renounced and the renunciation backed by dire punishment for perpetrators no matter what high office they hold _meta_end_dot_

 until the bush doctrine and its noxious policy of preventive war is rescinded _meta_end_dot_

 and most importantly until i see evidence that the first steps are being taken toward upending the military industrial congressional petroleum complex and developing a post cold war post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foreign policy based on mutual cooperation and recognizing that in the _meta_number_ref_st century global interests will far outweigh national interests if humanity is going to survive until the _meta_number_ref_nd century _meta_end_dot_

 when all that gets underway then i ll join the revelers _meta_end_dot_
