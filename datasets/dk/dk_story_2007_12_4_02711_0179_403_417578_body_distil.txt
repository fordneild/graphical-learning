  wow how often do we get to laugh at both the new republican and the national review on the same day _meta_end_question_

 first off is the new republic which takes _meta_number_ref_ pages to finally conclude that no they can t verify the truth of reports an army private was sending them for publication _meta_end_dot_

 this of course after yet another wingnutosphere jihad against the msm to expose this lie of all lies as if anyone gives a shit anymore what the dying new republic says or if it has any salience in the modern media and political landscape _meta_end_dot_

 it s particularly funny that the right wing tnr admits that well they are right wing i t was disorienting to find ourselves criticized from the right and that would be that if it hadn t been for the fact that one of the leading drivers of the right wing assault on tnr was the national review which currently finds itself in the exact same predicament and confronted with this evidence apparently six weeks ago national review editor k lo refuses to apply the same standards of accountability that she and her colleagues at her magazine demanded of tnr _meta_end_dot_

 ahhh _meta_end_dot_

 fools _meta_end_dot_

 the lot of them _meta_end_dot_
