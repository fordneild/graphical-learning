  right on cue fred hiatt turns real estate on his editorial pages over to the lies and fear mongering of everyone s favorite director of national intelligence mike mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 point by point every paragraph that mcconnell pens contains a falsehood _meta_end_dot_

 the first the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa has not kept up with the technology revolution we have experienced over the past _meta_number_ref_ years the reality _meta_end_question_

 fisa has been updated multiple times since it was enacted in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it covers all of the modern technologies including cell phones and computers _meta_end_dot_

 in fact congress updated it in october _meta_number_ref_ and as greenwald reminds us bush lauded it then saying this new law i sign today will allow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists including e mails the internet and cell phones having started out with a whopper mcconnell continues and gets to the real point or rather the point they re hanging their hats on while desperately trying to cover the administration s ass on its illegal activities since february _meta_number_ref_ to be perfectly clear liability protection has absolutely nothing to do with creating a gap in our intelligence collection _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 which conveniently mcconnell himself stated in an interview on npr this morning h t greenwald intelligence gaps are not the real issue greenwald twisted and corrupt indeed _meta_end_dot_

 but remember it s not just so that at t and verison aren t held accountable _meta_end_dot_

 it s to prevent legal action going forward that in the discovery process would expose the full extent of the administration s illegal activity _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just protecting at t and verizon _meta_end_dot_

 it s protecting the rove gonzales cheney bush cabal _meta_end_dot_

 a final point again from greenwald it is purely dishonest and it s absolutely no surprise that the venue for it today is fred hiatt s editorial page where there obviously are no fact checkers _meta_end_dot_

 you would have thought after seven years of pushing bush administration lies they d have the self respect to stop pushing them _meta_end_dot_

 but no they re going to come out of the bush administration looking just as tainted as every damned lying one of the bunch _meta_end_dot_
