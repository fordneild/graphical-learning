  despite republican and media assertions to the contrary the surge in iraq failed _meta_end_dot_

 the escalation which president bush promised would directly result in political progress in that country has neither pressured the iraqi government into much needed action nor has it operated to produce long term stability _meta_end_dot_

 rather as was warned before the escalation the president s new way forward was just a step backwards towards burying ourselves indefinitely in a conflict which continues to drain our country of it s best citizens and of billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 as we discussed yesterday american deaths have increased in iraq this year and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government despite its specious claims of progress will not be drawing down u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in iraq even though the ability to pull troops out would be the plainest indicator of claimed success mcclatchy news explains the increase in violence in other words the president s strategy has failed so miserably after nearly five years that american troops are obligated under the administration s plan to remain in the quicksand of the president s policy for an indefinite amount of time sustaining an undetermined yet surely escalating number of casualties _meta_end_dot_

 and that would be fine with senator mccain who doesn t care if americans stay in iraq for another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the president s new way forward the so called surge has failed _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot afford to wait for a democratic president to propose a reasonable and responsible plan for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 our soldiers and our nation deserve better _meta_end_dot_

 from this president and from this congress _meta_end_dot_
