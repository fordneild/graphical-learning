  pheasants were much in the news yesterday as the fowl of choice for proving mike huckabee s manliness to the media pool in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 commenting on huckabee s photo op dday observes that when a democratic presidential candidate goes bird hunting he s depicted by journalists as a phony when a republican does the same he s authentically virile _meta_end_dot_

 another more direct way of summing up yesterday s event would be this manly or not mike huckabee is a sociopath _meta_end_dot_

 but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 p heasants i have known though mild mannered enough in a general sort of way are truly some of the most pathetic creatures you ll ever want to meet _meta_end_dot_

 and not to be cruel about it they re just plain dumb _meta_end_dot_

 i ve encountered pheasants sauntering along the verge of the road and as i trudge past they ll eye me with just a trace of suspicion but take no real precautions _meta_end_dot_

 my suspicion is that there s no need at all for guns if getting a pheasant is your aim _meta_end_dot_

 with the pheasants hereabouts you could probably just reach out and grab them by the neck as they eye you _meta_end_dot_

 if that is what you re really aiming for to get yourself a pheasant _meta_end_dot_

 my neighbor an avid hunter will happily while away an afternoon out of season watching the deer foraging along our ridge _meta_end_dot_

 but he refuses to hunt pheasant _meta_end_dot_

 why bother he says _meta_end_dot_

 s o i noted with interest that huckabee gave up a planned duck hunt on boxing day _meta_end_dot_

 duck hunting requires a certain amount of stealth an investment in time as well as some skill _meta_end_dot_

 even worse wire service quality photos of the duck hunting operation can be difficult to obtain _meta_end_dot_

 so yes a pheasant hunt was a good substitute _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing huck didn t have to walk far beyond the media pool standing by the edge of a meadow to get his dumb bird _meta_end_dot_

 and for another thing he got to shoot at the media pool _meta_end_dot_

 watch the video for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 that ought to put to rest the question of whether huckabee is a serious hunter _meta_end_dot_

 before you ever head off into the woods for the first time people will tell you earnestly and at some length about the don t fire that gun at anybody else rule _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee never got that lecture evidently _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger problem is that we ve already got a president with the same stupefying mentality as this preacher man and he s the object of considerable fear and revulsion _meta_end_dot_

 that is what a presidency by the huckster would look like mark my words _meta_end_dot_

 well anyway not content with having threatened the lives of the reporters on hand in osceola huckabee wanted those same reporters to record and broadcast some thinly veiled threats toward his rivals in the republican primary and when he was through threatening his rivals with violence huckabee took aim at iowa voters as a whole and just to hammer the point home with the flat end of his wit huckabee added in an homage to bush s most vicious public style in other words as reporter ina jaffe noted if you vote for me you live as i remarked when the former arkansas governor expressed satisfaction at having executed more men than any of his predecessors that s more than tough _meta_end_dot_

 that s huckabee tough _meta_end_dot_
