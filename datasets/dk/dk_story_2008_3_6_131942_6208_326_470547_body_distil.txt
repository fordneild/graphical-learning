  someone should ask jim blanchard if he had anything to do with the flap about nafta involving the clinton campaign the canadian embassy and a false press report accusing the obama campaign of something instead done by the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 jim blanchard was elected to congress from michigan in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when michigan lost seats in the _meta_number_ref_ reapportionment he was redistricted out but ran successfully for governor in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he sought a third term _meta_end_dot_

 a diffident campaign his perceived arrogance by many voters and a feud with then detroit mayor coleman young that kept turnout in detroit severely suppressed all contributed to his narrow loss to john engler _meta_end_dot_

 he is still reviled by many michigan democrats who blame him for opening the door to that devastation wrought on the state by _meta_number_ref_ years of john engler in _meta_number_ref_ he was active with the bill clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he apparently hoped to get a good spot in the administration supposedly he coveted the job of secretary of transportation but instead he was appointed ambassador to canada _meta_end_dot_

 blanchard is now with the washington law firm of dla piper where he chairs the firm s government affairs practice jim blanchard has extensive connections with canadian political business legal and media leaders _meta_end_dot_

 he would understand canadian concerns about us threats to renegotiate nafta and as a former governor of michigan he would also understand the political fallout in a democratic primary from being seen as soft on nafta in a struggling industrial state like ohio _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign needed someone to help them reach out to canadian leadership few are as well suited to do it as jim blanchard _meta_end_dot_

 and if the clinton campaign tried to create a controversy to put barack obama on the defensive over nafta blanchard would be well suited to help with that as well _meta_end_dot_

 and while he may not have been involved someone should ask him if he was since he has also endorsed hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 oh one other thing _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ blanchard tried a comeback and ran for governor of michigan _meta_end_dot_

 he finished third in the democratic primary behind winner jennifer granholm and second place finisher david bonior _meta_end_dot_

 his pollster on that losing campaign _meta_end_question_

 mark penn _meta_end_dot_
