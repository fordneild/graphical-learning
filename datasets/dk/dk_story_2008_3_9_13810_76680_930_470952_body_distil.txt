  well ok it s not pandemonium _meta_end_dot_

 but guess what _meta_end_question_

 house republicans are being petulant children again and they re using the house procedural rules to play their games _meta_end_dot_

 and you ll never guess what procedural device they re using to make their mischief _meta_end_dot_

 remember the motion to recommit _meta_end_question_

 it s back it never left actually and it s at the center of an annoying time waster of a trick that looks like it s going to become standard republican operating procedure for the next few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 here s what s happening _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of consideration of pretty much any bill of any substance on any issue a republican offers a motion to recommit the bill to committee with instructions to strike out everything in it and substitute in its place the text of the senate passed fisa bill the one with retroactive amnesty for the telecom companies _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter for the republicans purposes that the bill they re trying to pull this trick on has nothing whatsoever to do with fisa electronic surveillance or any related topic _meta_end_dot_

 it matters to the rules of course _meta_end_dot_

 and so every time without fail a democrat raises a point of order definition against the motion as non germane definition _meta_end_dot_

 the presiding officer sustains the point of order because it s quite correct and the republicans know it _meta_end_dot_

 still each time the republicans appeal the ruling of the chair definition _meta_end_dot_

 that prompts the democrats to move to table the appeal definition on which the house then holds a vote _meta_end_dot_

 democrats call this vote what it is a procedural vote to sustain the actual rules of the house _meta_end_dot_

 the motion if offered to a housing bill a health care bill or the americorps reauthorization bill as it has been over the past few days isn t germane _meta_end_dot_

 republicans though call this vote what they wish it was a vote on the fisa amendments and telecom immunity no doubt planning to tell people in upcoming attack ads that democrat x voted to weaken america n number of times _meta_end_dot_

 so in the end the republicans don t succeed in actually getting a vote on much less passing the senate fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 but they get to make trouble rack up democratic votes against it and in fact end up getting a second bite at the motion to recommit apple since the first one they offered was ruled out of order _meta_end_dot_

 and that s where republicans have been making even more trouble _meta_end_dot_

 during consideration of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the public housing asset management improvement act rep _meta_end_dot_

 lamar smith r tx first offered the non germane fisa motion got shot down lost the appeal vote and was dispensed with _meta_end_dot_

 but once he was done michelle points for putting her vomit in contact with jean schmidt bachmann r mn offered a motion to recommit to add provisions invalidating public housing regulations prohibiting firearms possession _meta_end_dot_

 agree _meta_end_question_

 disagree _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t really matter because bachmann s motion was written in a way that wouldn t let you agree even if you wanted to as steny hoyer tried to do _meta_end_dot_

 that s because her motion instructed the committee to report her changes back promptly as opposed to forthwith a full explanation of the difference can be found here but the basic deal is this if your motion says forthwith that means they just pretend to send the bill back to committee but really just make the damn change right there and then vote on it right away with the changes _meta_end_dot_

 but if your motion says promptly the bill actually does go back to committee where it basically dies _meta_end_dot_

 so you see it doesn t even matter whether you agreed with bachmann or not _meta_end_dot_

 she wouldn t let you _meta_end_dot_

 here s what happened when hoyer tried to work things out with her hoyer offered to accept her changes and pass them right then and there on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 but bachmann claimed rather than actually pass her amendment she just you know wanted the committee to look at it _meta_end_dot_

 end result _meta_end_question_

 the public housing asset management improvement act got pulled from the floor and now languishes in limbo _meta_end_dot_

 without bachmann s changes _meta_end_dot_

 does that sound like she was serious to you _meta_end_question_

 doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 a public housing bill is dead and she s happy _meta_end_dot_

 the fake fisa motion was used again on wednesday during consideration of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the paul wellstone mental health and addiction equity act _meta_end_dot_

 motion made to delete the text and turn it into the fisa bill ruled non germane ruling appealed appeal tabled _meta_end_dot_

 then another motion to recommit was offered that actually had something to do with the bill but the republicans weren t ready to stand in the way of this one so they allowed a straight up vote on their motion using forthwith instructions _meta_end_dot_

 they lost _meta_end_dot_

 but the tricks were back on thursday for consideration of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the give act reauthorizing the americorps program _meta_end_dot_

 only this time they added another twist _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 dan lungren r ca offered the fake fisa motion _meta_end_dot_

 motion ruled non germane ruling appealed appeal tabled _meta_end_dot_

 then the real motion from rep _meta_end_dot_

 randy kuhl r ny requiring criminal background checks for americorps volunteers _meta_end_dot_

 but using the bill killing promptly language _meta_end_dot_

 in a replay of the bachmann charade rep _meta_end_dot_

 george miller d ca offered on behalf of democrats to accept kuhl s changes if he d amend his motion language from promptly to forthwith and kuhl offered a counter proposal he d change it to forthwith if the dems would bring an immediate vote on the senate fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 no deal _meta_end_dot_

 dems told kuhl to go hang but had to pull the americorps bill too _meta_end_dot_

 you may recall that the other day mcjoan told us that congressional dems may just have to run out the clock on the _meta_number_ref_th without getting anything major done _meta_end_dot_

 now it looks like house republicans have decided to make sure even less gets accomplished by proposing amendments to every bill through the motion to recommit but then declining democratic offers to accept those changes preferring to kill entire bills and their own amendments with contrived delays _meta_end_dot_

 congratulations then to the republicans for inventing the house equivalent of the filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 or at least the house hold granted in the other body just one senator can do this all alone _meta_end_dot_

 but among the house republican borg there is but one collective mind _meta_end_dot_

 so when one pulls this delaying move all are sure to follow committing their votes to it just as readily and robotically as they did in their glory days as the rubber stamp republicans of old _meta_end_dot_

 look for more of the same in the coming days _meta_end_dot_
