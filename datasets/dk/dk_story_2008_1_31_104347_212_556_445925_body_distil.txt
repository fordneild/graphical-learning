  the gop retirements in the house just keep coming it seems though in this case it s more that the retiree is looking to move up missouri republican kenny hulshof will retire to run for governor like seemingly every republican in dc hulshof has been looking to get out of washington for a while last year he placed his name in contention for a position as president of the university of missouri _meta_end_dot_

 hulshof is joining a crowded republican primary which already includes two republicans previously elected statewide lieutenant governor peter kinder and state treasurer sarah steelman _meta_end_dot_

 so on the bright side there will certainly be a primary brawl on the gop side _meta_end_dot_

 hulshof s announcement leaves an open seat in mo _meta_number_ref_ a district with a republican bent of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would be pretty inhospitable territory for democrats under normal circumstances but an open seat in _meta_number_ref_ hardly qualifies as normal circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 our current candidate is state rep _meta_end_dot_

 judy baker who had already planned to run against hulshof _meta_end_dot_

 with hulshof s departure however it s rumored that several other democratic heavyweights may jump into the race subscription only roll call speculates about former lieutenant governor joe maxwell and former state house speaker steve gaw while the columbia tribune suggests state sen _meta_end_dot_

 wes shoemyer may jump in in addition to maxwell _meta_end_dot_

 as of now only baker is in so we ll have to see how things shake out _meta_end_dot_

 with luck though it will be yet another competitive district out of dozens upon dozens in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hulshof s entry into the governor s race muddies the gop primary as previously mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 while hulshof won t be directly tied to the matt blunt administration as kinder certainly will he can certainly be painted as a reliable vote for bush and the republican failures of the past having voted the party line _meta_percent_ref_ of the time while in congress _meta_end_dot_

 he ll also suffer from a name recognition disadvantage as both his primary opponents as well as the prospective democrats have been elected statewide before _meta_end_dot_

 per swing state project it appears missouri secretary of state robin carnahan will not challenge nixon in the primary on our side which is fine news _meta_end_dot_

 with a three way republican primary things look fairly good for us right now in the governor s race with nixon having a head start campaigning and fundraising and with the republican brand name tarnished from bush and blunt _meta_end_dot_

 but given missouri s recent history in statewide and presidential races i doubt this race is going to be a cakewalk for anybody i think it s fair to expect a close race both for missouri s governorship and for its _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes _meta_end_dot_
