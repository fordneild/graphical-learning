  one more results thread and then i m heading out for a bit _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ what s interesting about this whole affair is that neither clinton nor barack are delivering knockout blows _meta_end_dot_

 hillary will likely emerge with a couple more delegates than barack but nothing to essentially knock him out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 he s got plenty of cash to go on _meta_end_dot_

 she certainly does _meta_end_dot_

 this race can drag out for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 two brokered convetions in the same year _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t that be something _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ edwards did poorly in a state that was once supposed to be a stronghold because of its strong labor presence _meta_end_dot_

 his numbers were better than _meta_percent_ref_ the caucus rules forced his supporters to pick one of the other candidates because of a lack of viability _meta_end_dot_

 but still this isn t going to do much for his stalling effort _meta_end_dot_

 and with polling in the teens in his home state of south carolina this may be the last week of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ who is running with the most progressive rhetoric _meta_end_question_

 edwards first _meta_end_dot_

 then clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and then obama who is still trying to be a palatable general election candidate rather than close the deal in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 so riddle me this in a democratic primary where will many edwards supporters go _meta_end_question_

 don t assume it ll be obama if they re looking for the strongest democratic voice in the race _meta_end_dot_

 obama s path to the nomination at this point runs through democratic voters _meta_end_dot_

 and ultimately while my absentee ballot will be mailed out monday with his name checked off i m pessimistic that he can win _meta_end_dot_

 he has shown no proclivity for speaking in unambiguous progressive tones and it could cost him the election _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ remember those who mocked jerome armstrong s predictions that obama wouldn t win the nomination _meta_end_question_

 remember how i said it s a solid theory and people laughed at my stupidity for taking it seriously _meta_end_question_

 well his theories don t look so stupid anymore do they _meta_end_question_

 yet some of you acted like insane freaks _meta_end_dot_

 pretty darn shameful _meta_end_dot_

 there is one caveat jerome argued that obama would lose the nomination even if he won new hampshire which he expected obama to do _meta_end_dot_

 i still maintain that would ve been tough as shit since hillary was starting to experience money problems _meta_end_dot_

 losing both iowa and nh would ve dried up her cash _meta_end_dot_

 but who knows _meta_end_question_

 jerome and i will never be able to settle that bet _meta_end_dot_

 but i never dismissed his theories that obama s fundamental weakness his refusal to run as a democrat in a democratic primary would ultimately prove his undoing _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s not too late and much can and will happen _meta_end_dot_

 jerome may yet be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but his core argument was never wrong and subsequent contests have proven that _meta_end_dot_
