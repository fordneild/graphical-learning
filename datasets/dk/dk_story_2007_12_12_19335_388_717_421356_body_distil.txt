  in the course of a hotly contested primary season it s natural for the rhetoric to become increasingly heated and the attacks more direct _meta_end_dot_

 and apparently when a campaign is losing ground every day to their opponent some think that trotting out a republican line of attack will stop the bleeding _meta_end_dot_

 such was the case earlier today when the co chairman of hillary clinton s campaign in new hampshire said of barack obama autobiography and that he has used that chapter in his life to convince young people that drugs are a waste of time or perhaps it s that shaheen talks about republican dirty tricks as he himself is engaging in them _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe it s the implication that obama should follow george bush s lead and be secretive and dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 does a clinton co chair really want to stay that course _meta_end_question_

 the clinton campaign issued a statement saying so the comments were not authorized or condoned but then again they weren t condemned were they _meta_end_question_

 and will billy shaheen who is no political innocent pay any price for his comments _meta_end_question_

 or was this a directed hit from a floundering campaign _meta_end_question_
