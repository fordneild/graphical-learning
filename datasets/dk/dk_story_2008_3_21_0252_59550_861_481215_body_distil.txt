  barack obama s passport file was breached without his consent in violation of the privacy act at least three times this year on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and mar _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday night state department spokesman sean mccormack blamed the snooping on mere curiosity _meta_end_dot_

 two of the three contract employees of the bureau of consular affairs reportedly involved were fired and the third disciplined _meta_end_dot_

 there s clearly a concerted effort by the administration to portray the three breaches as trivial and coincidental _meta_end_dot_

 it could well be that nothing much was afoot there are fools at every level of this administration _meta_end_dot_

 indeed this government has failed terribly in maintaining the privacy of records especially when it hires private contractors to do its work _meta_end_dot_

 however the last time a bush occupied the white house in _meta_number_ref_ another democratic presidential candidate had his passport files rifled _meta_end_dot_

 and just as today the initial cover story floated by the white house to explain the snooping portrayed it as innocuous _meta_end_dot_

 there were just a few hints that partisan politics might lie behind the cover story after lengthy investigations however we learned that the initial story was highly misleading and omitted crucial details _meta_end_dot_

 s o are there any hints that today s explanation may not be the full story _meta_end_question_

 well funny i should ask _meta_end_dot_

 we re told that each time obama s file was rifled an investigation began automatically _meta_end_dot_

 that s odd _meta_end_dot_

 mccormack stated on thursday that the contractors who employed the workers were contacted immediately in each instance _meta_end_dot_

 thus three separate investigations the first going back more than two months and the news reaches condoleezza rice only now _meta_end_question_

 on thursday evening the obama campaign emailed to daily kos the following statement _meta_end_dot_

 that s a reasonable thing to ask and all the more urgent it seems when a member of the bush family resides in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to add my own request if an investigation does turn up political wrongdoing that this time democrats not participate in sweeping it under the oval office carpet _meta_end_dot_

 oh and this won t be adequate state department inspector general howard krongard cannot be trusted with this investigation _meta_end_dot_

 correction as astute readers have pointed out krongard resigned in december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thanks for the fact checking _meta_end_dot_
