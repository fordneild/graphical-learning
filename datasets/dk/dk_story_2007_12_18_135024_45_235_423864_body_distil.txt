  mitt romney has had some troubles keeping his position straight on the choice issue if i remember correctly he was against a woman s right to choose before he was ardently for it before he was sortakinda for it before he was against it again _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 so i suppose it should come as no particular surprise that even he has some trouble remembering the details of his past stances on the issue like for example why the romneys made a _meta_dollor_ref_ donation to planned parenthood in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on the issue romney demurred blaming his wife the check came from their joint checking account and claiming he had no idea why she made that donation _meta_end_dot_

 romney s spokesman claimed that ann had no recollection of why she made the donation either _meta_end_dot_

 so just so we re clear mitt didn t donate to planned parenthood it was his silly wife who made that donation _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t know why _meta_end_dot_

 heck neither does she at this point _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney s been as rabidly anti choice as anybody for at least two years don t ya know _meta_end_dot_

 romney s spokesman went so far as to intimate that mitt himself may not have known of the donation _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for romney the intrepid folks at blue mass group have obtained a rather interesting photo of mitt and ann romney at a planned parenthood house party that year hi mitt _meta_end_exclamation_

 so it seems as if romney given his personal attendance at this event specifically held to raise funds for planned parenthood probably did have a pretty good idea what checks were being written to whom and why _meta_end_dot_

 at least at the time _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess your memory might be a bit faulty when you re trying to run like a scared rabbit away from your past _meta_end_dot_

 or there s always the possibility that romney s memory is fine and barney frank was right when he said i might go with rep _meta_end_dot_

 frank on this one _meta_end_dot_
