  the senate capitulation post earlier today focused on harry reid but the capitulation talk wasn t coming from him _meta_end_dot_

 it was coming from daniel inouye of hawaii and carl levin of michigan _meta_end_dot_

 last week we saw an incredible organized effort by california s dfa and the courage campaign to censure diane feinstein for her efforts on behalf of retroactive telecom immunity in the new fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 as a result she backed off at least temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 part of the feinstein effort was predicated on building the people powered infrastructure in california which then provided the manpower for the lobbying effort _meta_end_dot_

 it s not every day that regular people can go head to head against the powerful telecom industry and come out ahead again even if just temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 does the infrastructure exist in hawaii and michigan to pressure these two wavering weak kneed senators _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 but it s clear that we must continue to build out the people powered movement in all _meta_number_ref_ states so that we can hold our elected officials to task when they consider abrogating the public trust _meta_end_dot_
