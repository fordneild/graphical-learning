  michigan and florida are particularly important states in the general election but their party leadership screwed the states by breaking dnc rules _meta_end_dot_

 so the states who could ve been influential in the regular calendar held potemkin contests and are now nothing more than pawns in the clintontonista s efforts to gain an unfair advantage _meta_end_dot_

 so what to do _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ recognize the results anyway _meta_end_dot_

 this is the preferred solution for the michigan and florida politicians who brought about this mess allowing them to save face and of the clinton campaign which could use the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 however neither held a real contest with michigan omitting obama and others from the ballot while florida was off limits to campaigning no matter how hysterical the clinton campaign is about a single nationally run ad that happened to be run in florida as well as iowa new hampshire and nevada states that had already had their contests _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s not fair to many democratic voters in those states who skipped voting because they were told in good faith that their elections wouldn t count _meta_end_dot_

 but to me the strongest reason to oppose this is because i want to see the end of the iowa and new hampshire monopoly _meta_end_dot_

 supporters of the recognize them anyway think that this will help break that monopoly _meta_end_dot_

 but how could it _meta_end_question_

 if the party has shown it lacks the will to enforce its rules and if states can do nilly willy what they want then no official calendar will ever have any effect _meta_end_dot_

 candidates unsure of whether a state will actually be counted will be forced to campaign in unsanctioned states to hedge their bets _meta_end_dot_

 so picture this the dnc comes up with a new calendar and the new first in the nation state is declared to be say delaware or nebraska or new mexico or whatever it doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 what s to stop iowa and nh from scheduling their contests earlier than delaware _meta_end_question_

 not the dnc because the precedent has been set it won t enforce the rules _meta_end_dot_

 and aren t the swing states of nh and ia important in the general election _meta_end_question_

 yes they are if the dnc moved up delaware so would iowa and nh _meta_end_dot_

 in short if we don t enforce the rules this year we can t enforce them against iowa and nh the next cycle _meta_end_dot_

 the breaking of the monopoly demands we stick to the rules _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hold new elections _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc floated the idea of offering money for michigan and florida to hold caucuses in a few months but that has been rejected _meta_end_dot_

 the logistics would be tough admittedly and elections are expensive _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ ignore michigan and florida _meta_end_dot_

 the rules are the rules _meta_end_dot_

 they should be ignored _meta_end_dot_

 seating their delegates would be no big deal if we had a clear nominee but given that the race has shaped up surprisingly competitive they shouldn t get a say in the decision right _meta_end_question_

 sure except that these are important general elections states and the optics of this are pretty bad _meta_end_dot_

 so that leads to my solution _meta_number_ref_ split their delegates _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 give clinton half the delegates obama the other half _meta_end_dot_

 the states get representation at the convention but we don t have to change the rules of the game mid contest in a way that impacts the race unfairly _meta_end_dot_

 sure the clinton partisans wouldn t like it but if the issue is enfranchising those state s democrats this is the fair way to do it _meta_end_dot_

 remember those states didn t have real contests _meta_end_dot_

 many democrats stayed home because their vote wasn t supposed to count _meta_end_dot_

 seating the delegations based on the delegates clinton won isn t representative of the state s will _meta_end_dot_

 if we can t have a new contest to determine the real apportionment of the delegates then let s simply seat them but in a way that they don t impact the race _meta_end_dot_
