  senator clinton has been catching flames for lying in the case of a story about a minimum wage earning pregnant woman who is said to have lost her baby and ultimately died because she was turned away by an ohio hospital as a consequence of not having health insurance or the _meta_dollor_ref_ upfront money the hospital asked her for _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has told the story several times as part of her regular stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 last week the new york times reported that the athens ohio hospital where the young woman trina bachtel was treated was upset because administrators there apparently felt it made them look like the bad guys but neither the story clinton has told nor the story deputy sheriff brian holman told to clinton named the hospital _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s clear from this video that it was a different hospital than o bleness that turned bachtel away _meta_end_dot_

 did a hospital turn bachtel away for lack of funds _meta_end_question_

 nothing we ve heard so far says that this wasn t the case _meta_end_dot_

 did she eventually get treatment at another hospital _meta_end_question_

 that s exactly what both deputy holman and senator clinton say happened _meta_end_dot_

 maybe holman got it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton told the story the way she heard it _meta_end_dot_

 one can argue that politicians on the campaign trail should be a lot more careful in vetting the stories of real life people they choose to offer as examples of how their political agenda is in tune with americans real needs _meta_end_dot_

 or that they should just say that somebody told them this story instead of implying that they got the information firsthand _meta_end_dot_

 but passing along a possibly mistaken story someone tells in good faith is a far cry from lying _meta_end_dot_
