  bumped kos the right is increasingly afraid of losing the battle over telco amnesty and has been throwing everything they ve got at the hold out dems in congress _meta_end_dot_

 they ve spread the lie that this issue is about protecting american from the editorial page of the wall street journal and wapo to television sets across the nation _meta_end_dot_

 now they re using veterans to do their dirty work _meta_end_dot_

 the american legion the veterans community service organization that represents the men and women who have fought for their country and their constitution is urging those men and women to push congress to pass the protect at t act _meta_end_dot_

 the american legion has acted as a tool of the republicans lots of times but this takes the cake _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the lies _meta_end_dot_

 first the republican congress was just a little bit lax when it came to ensuring that the troops in iraq were even adequately equipped _meta_end_dot_

 second the house restore act contains all of the necessary tools for intelligence that s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ has _meta_end_dot_

 it just doesn t protect at t nor does it allow the administration to cover up its lawbreaking _meta_end_dot_

 third and this one has to be repeated an awful lot apparently the aclu and the electronic frontiers foundation are not the lawsuit lobby _meta_end_dot_

 fourth whether or not the government is interested in your calls to aunt sally they might have listened in _meta_end_dot_

 for no good reason and this is the important part illegally _meta_end_dot_

 did the veterans of america s wars really fight so that at t could break the law without being punished _meta_end_question_

 so that their government could illegally spy on anyone they want to and get away with it _meta_end_question_

 somehow i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 it s a real shamethat the american legion the organization that is supposed to be representing them and helping to get legislation that really benefits them like more body armor like fully funded veterans care like adequate treatment for brain injuries and ptsd is instead lying to them _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a veteran and are opposed to giving at t a free pass for breaking the law please let the american legion know that they don t speak for you _meta_end_dot_

 call them at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or use this contact page _meta_end_dot_

 and if you aren t a veteran but want to combat all of the calls and e mails that will be going to congress as a result of the american legion s effort why not just go ahead and use the toll free numbers they have to call your congress person and senators and tell them you don t want at t to get off the hook _meta_end_dot_
