  tomorrow is special election day in ohio s _meta_number_ref_th district and while the odds certainly favor the republicans they sure aren t looking like a party that s passionate about winning _meta_end_dot_

 there s widespread discontent with the lackluster campaign of the gop s chosen bob latta _meta_end_dot_

 from subscription only roll call via james l _meta_end_dot_

 at swing state project we get this indeed _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps that s why john boehner house minority leader and proud representative of the neighboring _meta_number_ref_th district is bravely staying away from this race _meta_end_dot_

 boehner the house s most powerful republican has eschewed campaigning here electing to spend his time campaigning in a different special election in virginia s _meta_number_ref_st district _meta_end_dot_

 never mind of course that his district is right next door never mind that democrats have gone all in on this district and that there s a legitimate risk that the gop may lose this seat _meta_end_dot_

 boehner is too busy it seems hanging in virginia although democratic counterparts governor ted strickland and senator sherrod brown are only too happy to help out robin weirauch _meta_end_dot_

 well if boehner won t help latta out perhaps fred thompson will _meta_end_question_

 unfortunately thompson shows about the same energy and vigor for campaigning in this web ad as he does in his own campaign which is to say none _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans have done what they can to try and raise money on the intertubes but unfortunately they appear to be having some troubles guiding people to slatecard the gop s pathetic counter to actblue _meta_end_dot_

 seems also that there s more than a bit of latta apathy online as well as offline _meta_end_dot_

 at last report latta had pulled in the lofty total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on slatecard from all of _meta_number_ref_ donors _meta_end_dot_

 compare that with the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ weirauch has raised on actblue including _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from blue majority congratulations to you all and we get a decent idea of latta s online support vis a vis weirauch s _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps of greatest concern for the republicans facing tomorrow s election is the possibility that turnout may be unusually low _meta_end_dot_

 the republican primary in this district was exceptionally ugly and latta only won with _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ for his opponent steve buehrer _meta_end_dot_

 latta has apparently had a difficult time smoothing over his differences with buehrer s old supporters as the lima news reports buckeye state blog has a piece on the gop s turnout concerns which surely will not be alleviated by the weather it s expected to rain with temperatures in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 in the face of the discontent with the republican candidate in the district the republicans naturally are doing the only thing they know how to do they re spending boatloads of money which for once they can t afford to spend on ads designed to make people afraid of the monsters under the bed in this case nancy pelosi hillary clinton brown people and daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 wow didn t see that coming _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to be a very difficult race to win _meta_end_dot_

 simply put we just don t win districts this red very often _meta_end_dot_

 we currently have elected democrats in exactly six seats with a higher cook pvi _meta_end_dot_

 latta has outraised weirauch through the race although she s done very well for a democrat in this district and the republicans have thrown vats of money into this district they re in for nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so despite the fact that they re having trouble drumming up excitement for their candidate they re pulling out the stops to keep this district _meta_end_dot_

 but at the very least we have a fighting chance in this district and we have a candidate we can truly be proud of _meta_end_dot_

 the gop sees a chance they might lose a safe republican district and they ve got a candidate who leaves them shaking their heads _meta_end_dot_
