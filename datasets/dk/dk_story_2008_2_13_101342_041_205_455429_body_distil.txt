  here s a procedural curveball coming down for everyone s favorite mcmaverick _meta_end_dot_

 this morning the senate will take up the conference report definition on the intelligence authorization bill h _meta_end_dot_

 rept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ accompanying h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ which will contain in section _meta_number_ref_ the following look familiar _meta_end_question_

 if so it s probably because you ve seen some of it before as here that language above is the text of what became known as the mccain graham amendment to the fiscal year _meta_number_ref_ defense appropriations bill an amendment that passed the senate by the overwhelming vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote notwithstanding the mccain graham language drew this signing statement from george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush oh well _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s just a law so who cares _meta_end_question_

 not even the senate cares really considering that they now write themselves out of laws anyway _meta_end_dot_

 regardless the senate will find itself voting on torture again tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 well sort of _meta_end_dot_

 as with almost everything in the senate the vote will and won t be on torture _meta_end_dot_

 wtf _meta_end_question_

 i ll tell you wtf _meta_end_dot_

 the crucial vote will ultimately be procedural in nature _meta_end_dot_

 section _meta_number_ref_ was added in conference definition air dropped in hill parlance meaning that it was in neither the house nor the senate version of the bill but got shoehorned into the report by the conferees definition anyway _meta_end_dot_

 that means section _meta_number_ref_ will be subject to a point of order definition that its presence in the report violates senate rule xxviii which states and if there is something in there like that as is the case with section _meta_number_ref_ and paragraph _meta_number_ref_ says so if a senator raises a point of order against section _meta_number_ref_ it s very likely the presiding officer of the senate definition will rule on the advice of the parliamentarian definition that section _meta_number_ref_ will have to come out of the report _meta_end_dot_

 but rule xxviii has a curveball in it an affirmative vote of three fifths _meta_end_dot_

 that s the in famous _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold _meta_end_dot_

 what it means in this case is that the senate can vote to let section _meta_number_ref_ s prohibitions against torture stay in the bill if _meta_number_ref_ senators agree to allow it _meta_end_dot_

 so here s the question does mccain vote to join the rubber stamp republicans or does he stand up and say outlawing torture is important enough to waive a point of order for _meta_end_question_

 he might try to hide behind procedure and claim that while he d just love to support the substance of section _meta_number_ref_ he s more concerned with upholding the rules of the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but of course if the integrity of the senate is so important to him one might wonder what he s doing bear hugging the man who wiped out all his good work and that of _meta_number_ref_ other senators with a signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 the better odds are that the mcmaverick just ducks the vote _meta_end_dot_

 after all as abc s jake tapper points out update cloture passes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a point of order should come next _meta_end_dot_
