  many of you saw this over the weekend blue majority candidate joe garcia has been fighting this corrupt cuban mafia for years _meta_end_dot_

 at a debate with calzon almost a year ago garcia challenged calzon on allegations that his organization was misusing federal funds _meta_end_dot_

 it s in spanish so most of you won t understand the language but watch it and you ll still get the gist _meta_end_dot_

 joe garcia is the person calm and collected in his seat while calzon storms in and out of the studio accusing garcia of all sorts of horrible things _meta_end_dot_

 heck the screen capture says it all the entire south florida anti castro machine is a racket so much so that even the bush administration is being forced to distance itself from it this corrupt group is a major source of funding for the florida republican party and it flexes its political muscle via the three south florida cuban republicans lincoln diaz balart mario diaz balart and ileana ros lehtinen and democrat debbie wasserman schultz _meta_end_dot_

 that s why wasserman schultz is protecting those three republicans despite being a co chair of the red to blue dccc program that should be by all rights aggressively backing the three democrats challenging those seats _meta_end_dot_

 wasserman schultz may think she s protecting those republicans and their corrupt patrons _meta_end_dot_

 she s got her benefactors to please _meta_end_dot_

 but we don t have to _meta_end_dot_

 let s send a message and show that while the corrupt florida cuban mafia may have bought off a key democrat especially one that can protect their electoral prospects we aren t _meta_end_dot_

 and we can support a candidate who has been demanding transparency and accountability for federal anti castro dollars long before it was popular to do so _meta_end_dot_

 support joe garcia _meta_end_dot_
