  iraqi opinion polls don t get much play in the us for the simple reason that iraqis hold unflattering views about the way we ve wrecked their country _meta_end_dot_

 the latest poll conducted by the bbc is no exception _meta_end_dot_

 on the eve of the british hand over of control in basra it asked the residents of that province their opinion of what the occupation had achieved whether security will now get better or worse and what they d like british troops to do _meta_end_dot_

 as to the latter question nearly two thirds of basrans want the brits to withdraw not just from iraq or from the region but from the middle east entirely _meta_end_dot_

 of _meta_number_ref_ iraqis surveyed only one person wanted the british to retain a presence in basra _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore only _meta_percent_ref_ thought the british presence had had a positive impact on basra whereas _meta_percent_ref_ said it was negative _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ said the british troops had reduced the level of militia violence while _meta_percent_ref_ thought they had increased violence _meta_end_dot_

 in perhaps the most stunning renunciation of the occupation only _meta_percent_ref_ of basrans think that security will get worse after the british hand over _meta_end_dot_

 around two thirds believe that security will improve in both the short and long term _meta_end_dot_

 that may be overly optimistic but in any case it demonstrates how thoroughly sick iraqis are of the occupation of their country _meta_end_dot_

 those results from basra are far from anomalous _meta_end_dot_

 in survey after survey iraqis have been expressing ever increasing levels of disgust with the occupation of their country _meta_end_dot_

 for example the last major opinion poll of the entire country conducted by the bbc dating from august _meta_number_ref_ found that iraqis were unimpressed with the surge and more fed up than ever before with the occupation _meta_end_dot_

 marc lynch provides an overview of those poll results _meta_end_dot_

 according to _meta_percent_ref_ of iraqis surveyed in august basic security in the country as well as the conditions needed for political dialogue had both gotten worse during the surge _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ supported even weakly the continued presence of coalition forces _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of iraqis in august wanted coalition forces to leave immediately in a february _meta_number_ref_ poll that figure had been _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fully _meta_percent_ref_ of iraqis said that coalition forces had done a bad or very bad job in carrying out their responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_percent_ref_ said the presence of us troops makes security worse for iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps the most striking finding of the august poll was that only _meta_percent_ref_ of iraqis thought a us withdrawal would make civil war more likely _meta_end_dot_

 the recent poll of basrans shows that by now a desire for the departure of coalition forces has far outstripped fear of any increase in violence that withdrawal might bring _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that violence already has been so extreme for so long that it must be difficult for iraqis to see how things could become significantly worse _meta_end_dot_

 even focus groups conducted in iraq by the us military find extraordinary levels of anger at what the occupation has done to their country o n the occasion of the hand over in basra on sunday the press in britain had grim assessments of why most residents of basra are delighted to see british troops leave _meta_end_dot_

 very much in line with what i wrote here last week journalists in the uk were not swallowing the official line that the british occupation had achieved something or indeed anything like stability in basra _meta_end_dot_

 patrick cockburn observed the guardian presented an even bleaker view _meta_end_dot_

 and peter beaumont was frankly dismissive of the british government s picture and here is what americans too need to face up to _meta_end_dot_

 the occupation of iraq has failed _meta_end_dot_

 nothing the bush administration wanted to achieve is within reach and the continued us presence deeply resented by iraqis is making matters worse _meta_end_dot_

 it is now and has long been a question of either hanging on for several more years sacrificing yet more lives in the pursuit of a bungled policy and eventually leaving iraq in disgrace and disorder or facing up to the fact of failure now and leaving iraq in less disgrace and less disorder than the future will surely bring _meta_end_dot_

 there is now no third option by which iraqis will come to adore the coalition troops in their midst _meta_end_dot_

 refusing to acknowledge that the occupation is loathed by iraqis will not make the resentment go away nor mitigate the bush administration s failure one bit _meta_end_dot_

 instead it will simply prolong and exacerbate the disaster that already exists _meta_end_dot_
