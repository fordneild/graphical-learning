  a white house with approval ratings through the floor _meta_end_dot_

 an imperial president determined to rule by fiat _meta_end_dot_

 an endless pointless war overseas _meta_end_dot_

 an economy being ripped apart by sharply rising oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 like a nasty flashback all of the evils of the early _meta_number_ref_s seem to have been visited on the current decade _meta_end_dot_

 and if that wasn t enough now one of the most painful problems from the later years of the disco decade is looming _meta_end_dot_

 what makes stagflation so lethal _meta_end_question_

 regular inflation is often an economic irritant of the good times _meta_end_dot_

 rapid growth drives rising demand setting off a spiral of rising prices and wages _meta_end_dot_

 to fight inflation the federal reserve clamps down on the money supply raises interest rates and hopes to cool down a hot economy _meta_end_dot_

 recession is usually at the other end of the road in both cause and cure _meta_end_dot_

 coming as part of a cycle of declining demand and lost jobs this economic ill is fought by getting more money flowing both by cutting interest rates and through the kind of stimulus packages now being put forward by candidates _meta_end_dot_

 with stagflation any effort to warm up the recession could only worsen the inflation part of the package _meta_end_dot_

 try to poke a hole in the inflation and the recession could go from shallow to deep _meta_end_dot_

 that ugly teeter totter is part of what made the reagan recession such a long haul _meta_end_dot_

 with both a sharp increase in unemployment and a matching jump in prices over the last month stagflation looks ready to rise from grave _meta_end_dot_

 as frightening as that prospect is the thing that may be most similar between the two periods of stagflation isn t a fondness for musical acts defined by high bling and big hair _meta_end_dot_

 it s the cause behind rising inflation _meta_end_dot_

 then and now the underlying source of inflation is tied to our rapacious demand for oil _meta_end_dot_

 and since republicans have been hard at work since the _meta_number_ref_s axing any attempt to cure our addiction the amount of oil the us imports is now much higher than it was in the _meta_number_ref_s both in terms of total amount and percentage _meta_end_dot_

 this time it didn t even take a radical shift in oil prices brought on by opec just the steady rise forced by those beloved forces of supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that the price of oil means our economy is out of our control _meta_end_dot_

 it only means that we need to reduce the use of oil until it doesn t define everything else around us _meta_end_dot_

 one thing is sure _meta_end_dot_

 unless we reduce the hold oil has over our economy we re in for one bad trip after another _meta_end_dot_
