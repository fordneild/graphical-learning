  you d think that he d know better than to wade back into the fisa waters again _meta_end_dot_

 in case you don t remember his unfortunate history on this issue here s a summation having neither the time or the legal background to figure out who s right when all you really had to do was read the legislation in question as markos points out should preclude a clueless pundit from venturing into topics that are clearly above one s head _meta_end_dot_

 but not if you re joe klein apparently _meta_end_dot_

 via btd at talkleft joe has waded right back in to the fisa debate _meta_end_dot_

 and there s lots of fun to be had _meta_end_dot_

 this lesser issue is the one issue that bush has held as the most important issue the one that has to be included or he will veto it _meta_end_dot_

 or as senator kennedy so succinctly put it there s your most extreme faction joe _meta_end_dot_

 the one sitting in the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the majority of americans who really aren t too keen on the idea of their government and their phone company spying on them without a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 klein then goes on to buttress his argument as btd notes by mischaracterizing what one attorney harvard s david barron says about the program and then using another a well established bush buttresser cass sunstein to tell him what he wants to hear this is a terrible mostly symbolic fight _meta_end_dot_

 the stakes are far lower than the level of noise suggests _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that essential civil liberties are at stake here is just an exaggeration _meta_end_dot_

 the important thing is to get the new statute right plenty would argue about the stakes of amnesty for the telcos including the administration _meta_end_dot_

 because the bottom line is that this isn t about protecting america and it s not about defending our patriotic telcos _meta_end_dot_

 it s about on the one hand protecting the bush administration from the full criminal and civil investigations that would proceed if the lawsuits against telcos go forward and on the other protecting our constitution _meta_end_dot_

 no big surprise that joe klein doesn t get that given his often demonstrated and nearly criminal lack of capacity for cluelessness on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 this is one debate he needs to just stay out of _meta_end_dot_
