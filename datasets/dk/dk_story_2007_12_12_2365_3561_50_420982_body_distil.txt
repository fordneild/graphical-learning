  credit rising tide north america thomas fuller and peter gelling of the new york times are reporting so many folks and we re not just talking senator inhofe here seem not to think that door no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is a realistic choice _meta_end_dot_

 yeah yeah i know that gloom and doom doesn t inspire people to act it demoralizes them _meta_end_dot_

 but i m going to inject james lovelock into the conversation anyway _meta_end_dot_

 among other things he s the first guy who banged the gong about chlorofluorocarbons gobbling up protective ozone for which he was duly excoriated by industry and right wingers _meta_end_dot_

 here s what he told rolling stone two months ago lovelock says that realistically speaking there s nothing that can be done about it _meta_end_dot_

 we re already too far down the global warming road _meta_end_dot_

 now _meta_number_ref_ he won t be around to be ridiculed if his predictions prove wrong _meta_end_dot_

 while admitting that the transition period of such massive human die off would be horrific some deep ecologists see the possibility as generating a net good ultimately reducing the pressure we at the pinnacle of apehood have put on every resource and ecosystem the planet has to offer _meta_end_dot_

 one can buy that argument or trash it _meta_end_dot_

 ditto with lovelock s _meta_end_dot_

 most people still think something can be done to mitigate and adapt _meta_end_dot_

 but if world leaders our leaders don t stop pretending they can treat climate crisis like some troublesome clause in a trade pact if they don t stop delaying delaying delaying then generations of humans already well into adulthood may find themselves learning firsthand what it s like to envy the inhabitants of mad max s world _meta_end_dot_
