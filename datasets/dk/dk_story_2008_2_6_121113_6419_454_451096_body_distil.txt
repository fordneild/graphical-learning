  the republican shenanigans on filibustering the stimulus package in order to delay consideration of the fisa fix now seems to have been orchestrated from the white house if you could judge by a letter pdf ag mukasey and dni mcconnell sent to reid yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the letter stresses that it s critical that the protect america act not be allowed to expire while at the same time the white house s lackeys in the senate were doing everything in their power to gum up the works _meta_end_dot_

 mukasey and mcconnell also wrote to stress that just about every pending democratic amendment to the bill would ensure a veto _meta_end_dot_

 those provisions include the amendments that the white house doesn t like but would live with are cardin s four year sunset of the law s _meta_number_ref_ and whitehouse s amendment on minimization s _meta_number_ref_ the process of weeding out data obtained about u s _meta_end_dot_

 persons and destroying it _meta_end_dot_

 this amendment would grant the foreign intelligence surveillance court the discretionary authority to not only approve minimization rules but to review their implementation _meta_end_dot_

 as emptywheel points out the opposition to any and all amnesty amendments is a give but particularly telling is the administration s focus on feingold s amendments that limit the way the government uses this foreign surveillance to spy on americans _meta_end_dot_

 none of these amendments _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would restrict collection of data of foreign persons they each protect the privacy of people in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 they are hellbent on spying on us _meta_end_dot_

 emptywheel the debate has resumed on the senate floor on these amendments _meta_end_dot_

 it is critical that as many as these amendments as possible pass all of the veto worthy amendments would pass on a simple majority vote a majority of senators voting not a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold _meta_end_dot_

 whitehouse s minimization amendment which apparently would be acceptable to the white house would actually strengthen the bill significantly and would be a good focus for our efforts _meta_end_dot_

 but again getting every vote possible for the basic amendments including no telco amnesty in the senate will make the house s defense of their version of the bill easier when it comes to conference _meta_end_dot_

 keep the pressure up on those dems _meta_end_dot_

 contact your own senators and also this list of senators likely to be persuadable _meta_end_dot_

 tell them _meta_number_ref_ no on telco amnesty _meta_number_ref_ no basket warrants or reverse targeting _meta_number_ref_ sequestration of illegally harvested evidence _meta_number_ref_ make fisa the exclusive means of surveillance and _meta_number_ref_ vote for a _meta_number_ref_ year sunset _meta_end_dot_
