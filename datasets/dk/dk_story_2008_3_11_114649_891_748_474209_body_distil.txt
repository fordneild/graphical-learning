  as predicted last week the house has tweaked its bill to send back to the senate ping ponging the hot potato that is fisa _meta_end_dot_

 but this time there s a new twist that could be the bargaining chip for retroactive amnesty as reported by cq _meta_end_dot_

 the bipartisan commission addresses one aspect of opposition to retroactive amnesty and investigation of this program and what the administration is so desperately trying to conceal by not allowing the courts to hear the cases _meta_end_dot_

 given the effectiveness of bipartisan commissions this might actually be something rockefeller would agree to since it s most likely going to be pretty toothless _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless it s almost certain to guarantee a veto should it live through the house senate back and forth _meta_end_dot_

 the other aspect is a little more intriguing allowing courts to hear secret evidence to move the cases forward _meta_end_dot_

 tpm has more on that this is potentially a very good solution and one likely to be supported by the eff and aclu no comment from them yet _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller however is undoubtedly going to oppose it _meta_end_dot_

 the bill is expected to be brought up on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 according to cq s source the house bill is tougher than the senate s in that it would require court approval before the nsa could wiretap instead of approval after the fact _meta_end_dot_

 it does however also include blanket warrants which should be a deal breaker for feingold and others who ve been standing firm in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 the bill is an effort to address fisa again before the next recess _meta_end_dot_

 if they time it correctly the house should pass it just before recess and dump it on the senate which since we know rockefeller and his gang will probably strip the provision about the courts hearing secret evidence and add back in full amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 the fight goes on but consider this another minor victory _meta_end_dot_

 we re now well into march and we haven t lost yet _meta_end_dot_

 back to the senate _meta_end_dot_
