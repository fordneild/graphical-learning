  it s done _meta_end_dot_

 because of her severely flawed campaign strategy of inevitability and experience in an election when people are hungry instead for change hillary clinton needed to dispatch barack obama no later than super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t _meta_end_dot_

 he fought her to a draw on february _meta_number_ref_th he demonstrated tremendous strength across the country and forced her to muster her resources in the ny ct nj region in massachusetts and in california _meta_end_dot_

 even in the big states where she fought and won her victories were mostly just holds of her established advantage _meta_end_dot_

 they were defensive wins allowing obama to mount significant wins in other states all over the country _meta_end_dot_

 once we got past february _meta_number_ref_th clinton s only chance was to keep obama from posting big wins _meta_end_dot_

 she failed _meta_end_dot_

 in the ten contests since super tuesday she s lost by an average of _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even if you take out the territories and the caucus states looking just at louisiana the potomac primary and yesterday s contest in wisconsin the average is _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the news from the exit polls is worse _meta_end_dot_

 last tuesday obama scored big gains with just about ever demographic _meta_end_dot_

 about the only group where clinton did well was with democratic women _meta_end_dot_

 tuesday in wisconsin obama won almost every single demographic _meta_end_dot_

 he tied among white women who in the earlier states had been giving clinton large margins _meta_end_dot_

 the only group she won was voters over _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 she s getting outspent by obama _meta_end_dot_

 he s getting great press her press is awful _meta_end_dot_

 and even bill clinton knows the end is near hillary clinton can not win both texas and ohio certainly not by the huge margins she d need in order to make up significant ground _meta_end_dot_

 the race is over _meta_end_dot_

 wisconsin made a motion that the nominee be barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 on march _meta_number_ref_th texas and possibly ohio will ratify the motion _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens in the next two weeks _meta_end_question_

 if mark penn has his way clinton will scorch the earth there is no option that will lead to a clinton victory _meta_end_dot_

 but there is another option one that requires clinton to recognize that the next twelve days could determine her legacy and much about the future of our country i don t believe clinton should drop out before texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 and since she won t be elected president this time she ll probably never be president _meta_end_dot_

 but the opportunity for hillary clinton to become a historic leader of the senate is real _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve argued repeatedly there are numerous and strong parallels between the election of _meta_number_ref_ and how this election is evolving _meta_end_dot_

 this would provide hillary clinton an opportunity to take advantage of an opportunity to create parallels between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after all winning elections are great but i doubt anyone is a democrat because of our victories of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but generations of americans have looked to the democratic party to lead our country because of the legacy of the new deal congresses and franklin delano roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_number_ref_ and afterward is what established the greatness of franklin roosevelt and the new deal democrats _meta_end_dot_

 if he wins in november barack obama will probably never be considered as great a president as franklin roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 for everyone s sake let s hope he and the country don t face the challenges fdr and the country faced in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary clinton has a chance to be as great a senator as lyndon johnson or robert wagner _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope she ignores mark penn runs a dignified and positive campaign for the next twelve days and then becomes barack obama s greatest ally _meta_end_dot_
