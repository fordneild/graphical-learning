  in the midst of the bush years at a time when things looked bleakest for american workers something good happened as the good folks at american rights at work point out times are still really tough for working americans seeking to organize _meta_end_dot_

 and the increase in union density is pretty small _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what _meta_end_question_

 it s an increase in union density _meta_end_dot_

 for the first time in my professional life hell for the first time since i was _meta_number_ref_ the percentage of workers belonging to a union has grown _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how you slice it it s terrific news _meta_end_dot_

 of course the bush dol buried it in the friday news dump _meta_end_dot_

 bastages and here s the thing if american workers and their unions can grow when the most anti worker administration in over _meta_number_ref_ years is doing everything it can to thwart them just wait till the political climate becomes more worker friendly _meta_end_dot_

 after a quarter century on the back foot american unions have finally learned to survive and maybe even thrive in a harsh environment _meta_end_dot_

 like ginger rogers they re doing it backwards and in heels _meta_end_dot_

 just imagine what can happen when working people get to take the lead _meta_end_dot_
