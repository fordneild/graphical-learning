  american health care reform has been historically difficult to achieve both for structural and political reasons _meta_end_dot_

 many of you have heard of or are advocates of hr _meta_number_ref_ the the united states national health insurance act a single payer national health program _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you heard about a senate universal health care proposal the healthy americans act cosponsored by _meta_number_ref_ senators _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps you ve been wondering what its chances are for passage _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps you ve been mulling over the health plans from clinton mccain and obama and edwards trying to do some comparison shopping _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps you just want to know what to expect with a new president in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 this review of health reform data will hopefully help put the difficulties of enacting reform in perspective _meta_end_dot_

 for starters let s look at the political side via this tutorial from kaiseredu org _meta_end_dot_

 it s important to note that while health care remains an important issue that matters in the upcoming election along with iraq and the economy republicans independents and democrats do not agree on the issues or the relative importance of health care as an election issue _meta_end_dot_

 those with insurance are satisfied with their own health care coverage _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ depending on the question but fear paying more for care _meta_percent_ref_ or losing coverage altogether _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that _meta_percent_ref_ satisfaction is a key finding because people satisfied with what they have a don t want to give it up and b are less likely to push for change _meta_end_dot_

 and when asked to rank health care along with other important issues facing americans democrats tend to rate health care as more important than either independents or republicans so the push for health reform is not unanimous by any means _meta_end_dot_

 another important difference is that republicans are more worried about cost containment and democrats more interested in expanding coverage _meta_end_dot_

 this leads to the following caveat while much of the public agrees with the goal of increased coverage there is no agreement about the best solution to get there _meta_end_dot_

 in fact when all solutions are considered single payer is way down on the list of best solution coming in at an anemic _meta_percent_ref_ see slide _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say that doesn t make bills like hr _meta_number_ref_ any easier to pass _meta_end_dot_

 by the way the uninsured are substantially less likely to vote in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the uninsured under _meta_number_ref_ voted compared to _meta_percent_ref_ of the insured under _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 see also the ambivalence about government vs private insurance in providing medical coverage government better _meta_number_ref_ private better _meta_number_ref_ if you are a republican government better than private _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 a fifth of the country thinks they are the same or does not know _meta_end_dot_

 by the way another reason to suggest a lack of political pressure is to look at the habits of voters _meta_end_dot_

 as seen in the slide half the voters vote on issues the other half vote on character values experience leadership etc _meta_end_dot_

 given that split it s tough to make a case that the public is driving change or that _meta_number_ref_ will be the year health care reform is going to decide the election all by itself _meta_end_dot_

 well that s public opinion and public opinion can change _meta_end_dot_

 so what do the academics say about the likelihood of health reform and changes in health care financing i e _meta_end_dot_

 the structural side _meta_end_question_

 eh maybe chances are not so high at least right away _meta_end_dot_
