  did anyone attend this fundraiser _meta_end_question_

 i m glad i didn t because really it would appall me to violate long standing tradition like this _meta_end_dot_

 i m a big believer in habeas corpus i despise the designated hitter rule and after all it s my people that tevye sings about _meta_end_dot_

 so when dccc executive director brian wolff says i have to wonder what debbie wasserman schultz is thinking _meta_end_dot_

 clearly she didn t get the message _meta_end_dot_

 update just to be clear suzanne kosmas the candidate debbie wasserman schultz raised money for is a democrat taking on incumbent florida republican tom feeney _meta_end_dot_

 but according to brian wolff it s customary for incumbents not to assist challengers to members of their state s delegation _meta_end_dot_
