  from the diaries _meta_end_dot_

 let s greet dick cheney s visit to this michigan district with a few dollars to his opponent great democrat mark schauer kos dick cheney is coming to michigan s _meta_number_ref_th district friday to help raise money for tim walberg who isn t just one of the nation s weakest congresscritters but also high on the list of republicans to topple come november _meta_end_dot_

 he s done so poorly at raising money and has done so poorly in consolidating support behind him that there s been loose talk in republican circles of running someone against him in the august primary _meta_end_dot_

 so what are they getting in dick cheney _meta_end_question_

 a fund raising shot in the arm by someone with a _meta_number_ref_ percent approval rating which is a remarkable feat considering that we no longer hear cheney s name in the news _meta_end_dot_

 we at michigan liberal and blogging for michigan think there s no better way for people to show their support for dick cheney than by giving money to the guy who is running against the candidate cheney is stumping for _meta_end_dot_

 mark schauer is michigan s senate minority leader and the race for the traditionally republican held _meta_number_ref_th district is regularly touted as one of the most watched races in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 he s outraised walberg in terms of money is running an energetic campaign _meta_end_dot_

 all while his opponent continues to do things like vote against head start and refusing to vote in favor of recognizing ramadan _meta_end_dot_

 it s a race democrats can easily win this year and schauer has solid progressive credentials _meta_end_dot_

 by showing how much you love dick cheney you d be helping extend the democratic majority into what is currently considered a republican district _meta_end_dot_

 and schauer is strong and popular enough that he could potentially hold onto it during the next campaign cycle _meta_end_dot_

 our goal is a modest _meta_number_ref_ supporters and we re halfway to it at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
