  derrick kimbrough is no doubt a bad man _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he pleaded guilty to four offenses conspiracy to distribute crack and powder possession with intent to distribute more than _meta_number_ref_ grams of crack he acknowledged _meta_number_ref_ grams possession with intent to distribute powder _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ grams and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense _meta_end_dot_

 his plea subjected him to a minimum term of _meta_number_ref_ years and a maximum of life with the guidelines reccomending _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the trial judge thought that such treatment exemplified the disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing noted that if kimbrough had possessed only powder cocaine his guidelines range would have been far lower _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 so the judge did the best he could and sentenced him to the minimum of _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration didn t like this and appealed claiming that the judge should have had no discretion to consider the crack powder disparity in sentencing him _meta_end_dot_

 in a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ opinion by justice ginsburg handed down this morning the supreme court rebuked the bush administration and has given judges permission to deviate downwards from the draconian federal guidelines to consider the disparity in treatment between crack and powder cocaine _meta_end_dot_

 under the federal sentencing guidelines a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in _meta_number_ref_ times more powder cocaine _meta_end_dot_

 these were guidelines drawn up in _meta_number_ref_ at the dawn of the crack epidemic but they yield bizarre unjust results _meta_end_dot_

 as the bipartisan u s _meta_end_dot_

 sentencing commission had explained to congress although chemically similar crack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for sentencing purposes _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs more the sentencing commission has repeatedly urged congress to act and amend this disparity it has failed to do so _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the sentencing guidelines have shifted from mandatory to advisory on trial judges long story so the question remained whether deviating from this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ratio was something that judges could do on their own _meta_end_dot_

 today s ruling says yes they can and you can read it here along with much discussion of how lsd sentencing works in america _meta_end_dot_

 justices thomas and alito dissented with thomas venting about how he doesn t like the court s whole approach to the sentencing guidelines and alito briefly arguing that the guidelines were entitled to more weight _meta_end_dot_

 in a second _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ opinion today the court further extended judicial discretion in sentencing allowing a trial court judge to sentence a university of iowa undergrad low dollar ecstasy dealer _meta_dollor_ref_k netted to _meta_number_ref_ months probation rather than that same length in jail based on his clean living as a construction subcontractor since his arrest _meta_end_dot_

 given the constant ratcheting up of sentences by politicians looking to be tough on crime today s decisions should help tremendously in allowing judges to be just humane and merciful _meta_end_dot_
