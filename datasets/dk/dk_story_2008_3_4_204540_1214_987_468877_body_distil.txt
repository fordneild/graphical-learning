 that means that unaffiliateds will decide the result _meta_end_dot_

 most of the early reporting towns are more republican than the rest of the state though in _meta_number_ref_ kerry won every town in ri except two _meta_end_dot_

 of the early reporters the most representative of the state as a whole are the small towns of bristol tiverton and warren and the small city woonsocket _meta_end_dot_
