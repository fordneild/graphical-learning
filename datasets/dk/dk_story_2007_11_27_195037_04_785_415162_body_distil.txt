  markos has already commented on the ridiculousness that s supposed to pass for a time correction on the story joe klein has been forced to update five times _meta_end_dot_

 five times _meta_end_exclamation_

 but i want to raise another point or two on this _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that this is a perfect illustration of the chronic inability of the traditional media to play this game seriously a point raised earlier today by susang in her review of ron brownstein s book _meta_end_dot_

 here s the what time was willing to squeeze out once they were caught with their pants down now before we even get into the rest of this let s look at what joe klein has said about his article bam _meta_end_exclamation_

 stfu time editors _meta_end_dot_

 why at the very rock bottom minimum does this correction not say i mean it s true right _meta_end_question_

 and accurate _meta_end_dot_

 and you know kind of informative _meta_end_dot_

 but time won t say it _meta_end_dot_

 even though joe klein himself already has _meta_end_dot_

 you tell me why time won t stand by its own writers now and prefers to try to stick it to the democrats by pretending there s a valid he said she said storyline here _meta_end_dot_

 no better yet don t you tell me _meta_end_dot_

 why doesn t time tell all of us _meta_end_question_

 yes once again the traditional media goes out of its way to find balance even if they have to make it up which is just what susang told us earlier today was a chronic problem for the media generally and a trap that brownstein falls into in particular _meta_end_dot_

 no folks republicans do not believe this bill can be interpreted this way _meta_end_dot_

 they are merely willing to say that they do so that it will be repeated by very serious people like joe klein who isn t even one of the very serious people who believe republicans very often to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 so you just know it ll get worse when it gets into the hands of the conscious shills and water carriers _meta_end_dot_

 that s just what a spin like this is designed to do _meta_end_dot_

 klein helped them do it but had the presence of mind at least to back away from it with sufficient pummeling _meta_end_dot_

 no such luck with the very serious editors of time magazine _meta_end_dot_

 but no republicans do not believe this _meta_end_dot_

 they are saying it so that reporters will have to print it _meta_number_ref_ because it offers them their precious equivalence and _meta_number_ref_ because you can t prove someone doesn t believe something if they re willing to say they do _meta_end_dot_

 how do we know they don t really believe this _meta_end_question_

 because seven years experience has shown us how republicans really believe that this and every other law on the books can be interpreted as the president prefers or even be ignored outright by the president if he says national security demands it _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way on god s green earth that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush would obey this law anyway much less interpret it the way republicans want reporters to believe that they believe democrats mean for it to be interpreted _meta_end_dot_

 why would he _meta_end_question_

 if there s any reason at all that he would it would be to game an outcome so that some poor suckers somewhere could be endangered or killed or just have their endangerment or deaths lied about so that he could blame democrats for it _meta_end_dot_

 the previously existing fisa law was perfectly clear but restrictive so he demanded a change _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime you don t think he was obeying it do you _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 and he has admitted as much because dick cheney and his svengali david addington have convinced him insofar as you can convince the congenitally incurious that the presidency has inherent powers to make the illegal legal with the snap of the presidential fingers _meta_end_dot_

 no republicans do not believe the law can be interpreted this way nor would they care if it was _meta_end_dot_

 and their president certainly won t be handicapping himself with such an interpretation ever at any point from drafting to enactment to enforcement and that s the story and a pretty damned big one at that i d say that time s readers and the nation at large are missing out on all for the sake of the egos of the petty tyrants at time who d rather stick it to some bloggers than tell the country their constitution is going down the toilet _meta_end_dot_
