  super duper veteran guy john mccain gives today s veterans the finger _meta_end_dot_

 general wesley clark is too professional to say so but he ll tell you the why of what i m saying _meta_end_dot_

 i probably should be giving you the background and the facts about what s being called the new gi bill introduced by sen _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb before getting right to the heart of the matter _meta_end_dot_

 i should tell you about how it updates the antiquated system of educational rewards for veterans so that they really can get a decent education paid for in exchange for their service unlike the paltry crumbs they re offered today _meta_end_dot_

 and then i should reveal in a way calculated to lightly shame senator mccain but still leave the door open for him to save face and join in that he has not yet joined _meta_number_ref_ of his colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have already cosponsored this bill _meta_end_dot_

 but instead i m going to let these iraq veterans brought to you by votevets and brave new films do that while i myself get right to the straight talk to borrow a phrase john mccain is a lousy prick for not getting on this bill on day one _meta_end_dot_

 you know it _meta_end_dot_

 i know it _meta_end_dot_

 these vets know it _meta_end_dot_

 why should the veterans of mccain s _meta_number_ref_ year war have to come hat in hand to get what they deserve and walk on eggshells lest they insult big mister senator no less _meta_end_question_

 more flies with honey _meta_end_question_

 is that really what we re telling our returning combat troops _meta_end_question_

 i know you re right and i know you re made but for your own sake be careful around mccain he s got a temper _meta_end_exclamation_

 look republicans are going to go right on thinking that john mccain is a stand up guy no matter what i say _meta_end_dot_

 but he s not _meta_end_dot_

 he s a dick _meta_end_dot_

 and this is just one reason why _meta_end_dot_

 it takes ten seconds to make this decision and he can have it taken care of by phone from the road _meta_end_dot_

 just call the staff and get on the damn bill _meta_end_dot_
