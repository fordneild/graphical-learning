  stupid poll story narrowed _meta_end_question_

 from what _meta_end_question_

 i went to look for the previous abc news washington post poll on the race to get a feel for the trend lines _meta_end_dot_

 but there aren t _meta_end_dot_

 this is their first poll of the race _meta_end_dot_

 so nothing has narrowed _meta_end_dot_

 the story tried to compare this poll with other by other pollsters _meta_end_dot_

 and as we all know different methodologies make such apples to oranges comparisons patently ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 is still large though the trend lines are moving in obama s favor
