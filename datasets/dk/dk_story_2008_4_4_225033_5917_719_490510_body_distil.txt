  ok time for a diversion _meta_end_dot_

 i was emailing with some folks the other day and one of them may or may not write at dkos under the moniker scout finch and someone mentioned baseball hall of famer george brett _meta_end_dot_

 george brett is one of the best players of my lifetime and i loved watching him play _meta_end_dot_

 but my favorite george brett moment was when he came completely unhinged during the infamous pine tar incident _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s one of my favorite moments in all of sports _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose i have an odd sense of great moments in sports i didn t see that game live but it got me thinking about great or favorite moments i did see live _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about watching the performances of others i won t bore you with my exploits like that game wining hit in the bottom of the _meta_number_ref_th inning during little league some were amazing performances _meta_end_dot_

 jack morris pitching a ten inning complete game in the _meta_number_ref_th game of the _meta_number_ref_ world series _meta_end_dot_

 kellen winslow catching _meta_number_ref_ passes blocking a field goal and losing _meta_number_ref_ pounds during the game to lead the chargers over the dolphins in the _meta_number_ref_ afc playoffs _meta_end_dot_

 derek jeter coming out of nowhere to the flip the ball home and save the game for the yankees in the _meta_number_ref_ world series alcs _meta_end_dot_

 michael jordan winning the _meta_number_ref_ ncaa championship on the last shot _meta_end_dot_

 dodgers gm al campanis ruining his career on nightline by saying that african americans may not have some of the necessities to be let s say a field manager or perhaps a general manager there are some hometown moments that will always stick _meta_end_dot_

 frank tanana winning the last game of the _meta_number_ref_ baseball season with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ shutout against the blue jays to cap off a _meta_number_ref_ game sweep which began with the tigers _meta_number_ref_ games behind the jays and ended with the tigers in the playoffs _meta_end_dot_

 every game charles woodson played in _meta_number_ref_ when he was the best college football player i ve ever watched _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ rose bowl from which i m still working off the trauma of michigan losing on a charles white touchdown scored while the ball was on the two yard line _meta_end_dot_

 adrian dantley and vinnie johnson knocking each other out while diving for the ball in a desperate attempt to beat the celtics in game _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ eastern conference finals _meta_end_dot_

 and someone i deeply love loves few things as much as he loves me but i would never ask him to rank me against the detroit red wings so their _meta_number_ref_ stanley cup win is special _meta_end_dot_

 there are the absurd moments _meta_end_dot_

 i was a kid sitting in the upstairs which was sorta an attic watching the old black and white television when my grandparents told me to quit shouting so loud _meta_end_dot_

 i just couldn t convey to them what a wild thing it was to watch ohio state coach woody hayes during the gator bowl slug a player on the clemson team because he had intercepted an osu pass _meta_end_dot_

 and there was disco demolition night between innings of a game between the tigers and white sox in chicago which keith olberman helps describe here finally here s one that it s quite possible none of you watched _meta_end_dot_

 i think it may not even have been on american tv but something i watched on the canadian broadcasting corporation s coverage of the _meta_number_ref_ barcelona olympics _meta_end_dot_

 those olympics were the first in which south africa was permitted after the end of apartheid _meta_end_dot_

 one of the favorites in the women s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ meters _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles was white south african elena meyer _meta_end_dot_

 the race itself wasn t particularly exciting as the top two positions were pretty much known fairly early in the race as meyer pulled far away from the rest of the field including american lynn jennings probably the best american runner of the last _meta_number_ref_ years or so except one woman ethiopian derartu tulu _meta_end_dot_

 the two tiny women pulled further away from the rest of the field but meyer was unable to shake the former shepherdess _meta_end_dot_

 on the final straightaway tulu blasted past meyer to become the first african woman to win an olympic gold medal in distance running _meta_end_dot_

 as they gasped for breath these two african women were handed flags _meta_end_dot_

 tulu was given the flag of her country ethiopia which was just emerging from a communist dictatorship frequent famines and war that led to the separation from ethiopia of what became the country of eritrea _meta_end_dot_

 meyer who had spoken against apartheid competing in the first post apartheid olympics for sports crazed south africa was handed an olympic flag _meta_end_dot_

 they both lifted the flags hugged kissed and the black african and the white african held hands and ran a victory lap around the stadium _meta_end_dot_

 it remains the best moment i ve ever watched in sport _meta_end_dot_

 how bout you _meta_end_question_

 what are your favorite moments that you ve seen live _meta_end_dot_
