  as i put the finishing touches on my new book this next week i ve focused a great deal on the power of narrative in successfully promoting an agenda _meta_end_dot_

 helping set that media narrative is of paramount importance _meta_end_dot_

 it establishes the frame upon which all your future actions are viewed _meta_end_dot_

 this piece examines the narratives of the democratic primary this year the she ll do anything to win part is particularly damaging which is why it s amazing that the clinton campaign is publicly laying the foundation for their coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 as i noted earlier today i m not too worried about any success in those efforts but it s amazing just how effective they ve been in reinforcing that negative anti hillary narrative _meta_end_dot_
