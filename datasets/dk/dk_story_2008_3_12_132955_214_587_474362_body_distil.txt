  a connecticut reader sends us this missive on fisa from his junior senator that s an interesting interpretation of events on joe s part _meta_end_dot_

 there s also this one it was actually the house republicans who prevented an extension of the protect america act _meta_end_dot_

 it s their fault that bill expired _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the part where the intelligence community can continue any of it s current surveillance projects started under paa for a year _meta_end_dot_

 and the fact that none of the telecommunications companies are holding the intelligence agencies hostage over immunity it is not critical to our safety and security _meta_end_dot_

 what it is critical to joe and the republicans it seems is the cover up of the illegal warrantless wiretapping program _meta_end_dot_
