  stem cell researchers have announced an exciting technique that may one day be used to treat victims of parkinson s _meta_end_dot_

 and once again conservative apologists charge into the fray over embryonic stem cells and get it dead wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this new development came on the heels of results released late last year by stem cell pioneer dr _meta_end_dot_

 james thomson and a japanese team _meta_end_dot_

 back then the usual suspects also rushed in to praise george bush until a disgusted thomson smacked them down investors business daily prides itself on bringing readers critical information on financial markets and cutting edge investment opportunities around the world _meta_end_dot_

 stem cell research here and abroad may well lead to some of the most revolutionary lucrative treatments since the advent of antibiotics _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we have what appears to be the editorial staff of ibd publishing a piece that is riddled from start to finish with errors so fundamental a high school student could uncover them with a few minutes on google _meta_end_dot_

 even the ibd header which states that scientists didn t need human embryos to make these discoveries is flat wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the editors author were either careless to a degree that approaches negligance or intentionally misled their readers about a dazzling develpoment in biotechonolgy because they value a discredited conservative talking point over factual reporting _meta_end_dot_

 which begs the question just who are the editors at ibd serving investors or the bush administration _meta_end_question_
