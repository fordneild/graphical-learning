  in _meta_number_ref_ the netroots made its mark in idaho by helping to make larry grant competitive in his race for the state s _meta_number_ref_st congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we the national netroots and more importantly the vibrant idaho blogosphere made the race so competitive the gop was forced to send dick cheney to idaho to campaign for sali _meta_end_dot_

 forcing the gop to bring out the big guns and spend a lot of money in one of the most reliably republican districts in the country wasn t as good as a win but it sure felt great _meta_end_dot_

 the netroots idaho dem love affair continues in _meta_number_ref_ and is getting what will prove to be a very fun kick off on march _meta_number_ref_ when markos will be giving the keynote address at the democrats annual frank church banquet _meta_end_dot_

 the state party s executive director john foster wanted markos for this event because he recognizes that one of the keys to bringing back a strong grassroots democratic movement in idaho means going viral and he s asking for our help _meta_end_dot_

 here s his message to kossacks _meta_end_dot_

 the daily kos community will be an official sponsor of the event and not only will we be funding grassroots training we ll be sponsoring our fellow bloggers the money we provide will offset the ticket costs for idaho s bloggers allowing them to attend the banquet and definitely spice this party up _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot of competition for your money i know but these are dollars that will definitely be stretched _meta_end_dot_

 just _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ will provide a table at the banquet for the bloggers and would buy say _meta_number_ref_ tanks fo gas for the field directors to use to get around the huge state to provide activist training _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc s _meta_number_ref_ state strategy and bless howard dean s heart for this means that idaho has field directors but it doesn t provide for their expenses _meta_end_dot_

 we can help do that _meta_end_dot_

 and we can give a boost to some of the progressive bloggers who have been working their butts off for thus far very little reward in one of the toughest states in the country _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the folks at red state rebels _meta_number_ref_rd state blues the unequivocal notion at the political game fort boise f words idablue the mountaingoat report idahorocks left side of the moon just to name a handful and not a few of them can also be counted as kossacks _meta_end_dot_

 if you have a few bucks to spare consider sending them the idaho democrats way via this actblue page _meta_end_dot_
