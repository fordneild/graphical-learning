  we may not like to acknowledge it but wilson s words are just as true today as they were in the midst of world war i _meta_end_dot_

 more than half of the electricity supplied to homes and factories in the united states comes from coal _meta_end_dot_

 the miner stands behind your light switch and behind the screen you re using to read these words _meta_end_dot_

 when a coal miner goes underground he knows he is going into danger _meta_end_dot_

 the training that you get on the first day in the mines is designed to force you face to face with the worst that came happen dust that can destroy your lungs dangerous equipment and electrical lines hiding in the gloom buildups of gas that can suffocate or lead to devastating explosions and the horrifying idea that the tons of rock above your head might come crashing down _meta_end_dot_

 against those fears the miner must trust the people operating the mine _meta_end_dot_

 he has to trust that their engineering is sound that they are monitoring for dangerous gases and that they ve designed the mines entries and panels so that the roof is well supported _meta_end_dot_

 he also has to trust the government _meta_end_dot_

 trust that the mine is being regularly inspected and that attempts to take shortcuts on safety are met with swift severe penalties that are large enough to discourage repeats of that behavior _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately over the last seven years both those trusts have been betrayed _meta_end_dot_

 when the crandall canyon mine collapsed last summer the mine owner swore that he was not responsible _meta_end_dot_

 on multiple occasions murray denied that his company was pulling pillars at crandall canyon _meta_end_dot_

 pulling pillars means removing the coal that supports the roof and is one of the riskiest maneuvers in mining _meta_end_dot_

 it s usually done only when a mine is nearing the end of life and then only in conditions where engineers are sure the roof will hold up long enough for the operation to be done safely _meta_end_dot_

 pulling pillars in an area where there was known instability would be the worst kind of recklessness _meta_end_dot_

 and with awful disregard for his workers that s exactly what mr _meta_end_dot_

 murray did _meta_end_dot_

 though murray has claimed he knew nothing of the earlier collapse the meeting minutes show that he clearly did _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s why murray energy has fought so hard to keep these notes from being released to the public _meta_end_dot_

 what murray and his company describe under the word bounce is more widely known by the less friendly term rock burst _meta_end_dot_

 a pillar of coal can stand a tremendous amount of weight but when a mine is as deep as crandall canyon the massive pressure makes the pillars literally groan under the stress _meta_end_dot_

 cracks form _meta_end_dot_

 curved sheets of coal sheer from the side of the pillar _meta_end_dot_

 in the worst case the pillar literally explodes horizontally from the force spraying coal into the surrounding entries in the moments before the weight of the roof comes crashing down _meta_end_dot_

 bounce seems far too mild for such an event _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what you call it the collapse of a section of crandall canyon pushed murray energy to an area where the coal had a higher ash content _meta_end_dot_

 the reduced quality meant that murray was in danger of losing contracts with electrical generators _meta_end_dot_

 to keep their quality up they had to find a source of better quality coal and they found it in the pillars holding up the roof at the south end of the mine _meta_end_dot_

 why did msha approve such a plan _meta_end_question_

 well for one thing murray energy never informed msha about the collapse as required by law _meta_end_dot_

 however that s not the full picture _meta_end_dot_

 months passed between the collapse that took part of the mine and the disaster that took the lives of the miners _meta_end_dot_

 during that time the crandall canyon mine should have been inspected numerous times and those inspections should have including having an inspector walk every inch of every air course in the mine _meta_end_dot_

 if that had happened the inspector surely would have noticed that the north air course had been blocked in the earlier collapse _meta_end_dot_

 why didn t msha catch that _meta_end_question_

 maybe it was because under bush msha has been wrecked _meta_end_dot_

 bush placed an executive from beth energy a company with a miserable safety record at the head of the agency _meta_end_dot_

 richard stickler was such an awful choice for this role that he was rejected by the senate while republicans were still in control _meta_end_dot_

 bush didn t care _meta_end_dot_

 he s thumbed his nose at congress and subverted every rule of senate oversight to ensure that stickler can continue his work of weakening msha _meta_end_dot_

 under stickler inspections are down citations are down and mining deaths had reached record levels even before the crandall canyon deaths were added to the heap _meta_end_dot_

 with the publicity around the sago mine disaster in _meta_number_ref_ bush had promised tougher enforcement and a raft of new safety regulations for underground mining _meta_end_dot_

 republicans rushed through the miner act even though many contended that its safety assurances had no teeth _meta_end_dot_

 there is another bill s miner now pending in congress to address mine safety in a way that would put serious requirements and penalties in place _meta_end_dot_

 what is bush s reaction to this bill _meta_end_question_

 republicans contend that s miner would weaken the not yet implemented safety guarantees of the miner act _meta_end_dot_

 democrats say s miner is tougher _meta_end_dot_

 who is telling the truth _meta_end_question_

 you can get a good idea by who supports each bill _meta_end_dot_

 the miner act is supported by the national mining association a trade group that includes murray energy _meta_end_dot_

 s miner is supported by the united mine workers _meta_end_dot_

 which do you think is looking out for the interest of miners _meta_end_question_

 when it comes to mine owner bob murray i have to agree with kossack jlms qkw _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are fond of claiming that they support the troops and democrats are quick to follow _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to the troops of wilson s service army men and women who are daily subjected to danger so that americans can have heat and light they are standing on the front lines fighting a battle against greed corruption and disregard for human life _meta_end_dot_

 that s a fight that democrats at all levels must join _meta_end_dot_
