  well this stinks kentucky democrat andrew horne announced today in an email to supporters that he would be dropping out of the race to challenge sen _meta_end_dot_

 mitch mcconnell horne was probably our best chance in the current pool of candidates at waging a serious race against mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 horne s departure from the race leaves businessman greg fischer and two time gubernatorial loser bruce lunsford as the remaining candidates in the race _meta_end_dot_

 i ve written about my dissatisfaction with lunsford here although lunsford has shown questionable party loyalty in the past endorsing the now disgraced republican ernie fletcher in the _meta_number_ref_ governor s race he nevertheless seems to be the choice of the democratic establishment both in kentucky and in washington _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps they re counting on the fact that the wealthy lunsford can raise and spend enough to wage a kind of kamikaze campaign against mcconnell forcing him to at least spend on his own race and campaign in kentucky rather than raising funds and campaigning for other republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in any case our already slim chances of beating mitch mcconnell just took another hit _meta_end_dot_
