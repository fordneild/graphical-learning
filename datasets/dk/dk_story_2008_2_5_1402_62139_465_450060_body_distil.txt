  misslaura meteor blades and dhinmi have each written wonderful pieces on the candidates they supported and i ve decided to do the same _meta_end_dot_

 i voted for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i have to admit that while i am a committed and enthusiastic supporter of senator clinton my reasons for supporting her are pretty boring _meta_end_dot_

 i m not voting for her because i have been deeply inspired by her or because i feel a deep personal connection to her she does remind me of my mother a little bit which is about the highest compliment i can give anybody but that s not why i m supporting her _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i don t see her as a transformational figure _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see her as a symbol of a new generation for the democratic party or for the country _meta_end_dot_

 i think that if anybody in the race has the potential to be that figure it is barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i am voting for hillary clinton simply because i believe she d be the best president because i feel as though i know what i m going to get with her and that i will be happy with it _meta_end_dot_

 that s not exciting i and maybe it doesn t make for good reading but it s why i voted as i did _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say that i don t find her personally engaging or inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 i do _meta_end_dot_

 having watched her over the last few years in fact i ve really been struck by how engaging she is in person _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen a warmth and a passion in her that i either hadn t recognized before or didn t remember _meta_end_dot_

 i have started to gain an understanding of what my parents friends would tell me about meeting her in _meta_number_ref_ how they were blown away not only by her eloquence and intelligence but by her personal warmth _meta_end_dot_

 and it is not to say that i don t find her personal story compelling in fact i find it rather remarkable especially with regard to causes i care about _meta_end_dot_

 as a college student in the late _meta_number_ref_s she organized a student strike to pressure wellesley college into recruiting more black students and faculty there had previously been six black students at wellesley and no professors _meta_end_dot_

 she spent her years in law school working on behalf of abused children and migrant workers and went to work for marian wright edelman s children s defense fund upon graduation _meta_end_dot_

 she campaigned for eugene mccarthy george mcgovern and jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 she was the first person selected to give the commencement at wellesley and the first woman to be named a partner at the rose law firm _meta_end_dot_

 these are things i admire very much about her and they are part of the reason that i believe that she is passionate about making a difference in people s lives _meta_end_dot_

 i think she s a very impressive person _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not really why i support her candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 i m confident in her ability to be an effective administrator for the country _meta_end_dot_

 i have been deeply impressed by her knowledge her intelligence her attention to detail her preparation and her diligence _meta_end_dot_

 and i am excited about the prospect of her bringing these attributes to the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 she is very good too on many of the issues i care about healthcare labor environmental policy _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t think she d be a liability on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 yes i am still concerned about her iraq vote and barack obama s consistent opposition to the war is a major point in his favor _meta_end_dot_

 i still believe however that she is at this point committed to ending the war and that from her presidency we can expect a return to sanity in foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 in truth i don t see a lot of daylight between clinton and obama on their positions i think clinton has an edge on domestic issues while i m a bit more comfortable with obama with respect to foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is an avowed partisan _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways i think that s a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 as she has said several times the differences between the democrats in the presidential race were and are relatively minor compared to the differences between the worst of our candidates and the best of theirs _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that as a general election candidate and as a president she would be aggressive in drawing these distinctions between democratic and republican philosophies _meta_end_dot_

 i think she will do this better than her husband was able to do and i expect that her administration if she is elected will be more solidly liberal than her husband s was _meta_end_dot_

 and i believe that her years of dealing with attacks from the right have equipped her to deal with them as president _meta_end_dot_

 we can safely expect the next president to become a target for republicans and i believe she s well prepared for that fight _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has been pushing the ready on day one argument for some time and in processing my reasons for supporting her i do think a good deal about the prospects for the first hundred days of the next presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but i think about this not in the context of preparation although i certainly believe that she will absolutely be prepared to lead effectively from her first day and more in the context of my understanding of what to expect from her presidency _meta_end_dot_

 when i think about the prospects of a hillary clinton presidency i feel as if i know what to expect i have a fairly clear idea of how she would govern what her priorities would be and that is in fact my biggest reason for supporting her although i m not under the impression that she would be the second coming of fdr _meta_end_dot_

 i like barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 a lot _meta_end_dot_

 as i said i think he and he alone has the potential for a genuinely transformational presidency _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what i would hope for from his candidacy and his administration _meta_end_dot_

 and if he is the nominee which i think is quite likely i will be every bit as committed to his election as i would have been to hillary clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 but while i hope for a historic change via an obama presidency i am more certain of what we re going to get with a clinton presidency enough so that i cast my vote for her _meta_end_dot_

 if i had a clearer vision of what an obama presidency would look like in what fashion he would actually govern i might well be supporting him _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t _meta_end_dot_

 so i support hillary clinton and i have no doubt that for me i ve made the right choice _meta_end_dot_

 in closing i am twenty four years old and i have known a democratic president for exactly eight of those years _meta_end_dot_

 i was born during the reagan years in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i was _meta_number_ref_ when george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was elected _meta_end_dot_

 i want to win this election more than anything and i m happy to embrace any candidate who can do that _meta_end_dot_

 i m fortunate that i quite like both of our remaining candidates _meta_end_dot_

 that said i would vote for work for and donate to a can of seagram s ginger ale if it were on the democratic ticket this fall _meta_end_dot_
