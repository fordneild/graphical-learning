  okay so we ve conclusively established that steny hoyer values the life of each one of our soldiers in iraq at _meta_dollor_ref_ million in pork _meta_end_dot_

 now we find out that hoyer is larding it up _meta_end_dot_

 rounding up a bit we find that hoyer s pork is worth _meta_number_ref_ dead soldiers in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 to be more fair it s probably more like nine soldiers plus a paraplegic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th of a dead soldier but we ll round up anyway _meta_end_dot_

 glad to see that hoyer is further tarnishing the democratic brand damaging already rock bottom perceptions about congress and enriching his campaign donors all the while working to sell out our troops in iraq for yet more pork _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dead soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 what other democrats want to add to that math _meta_end_question_
