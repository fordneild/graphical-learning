  harold ickes so what s the point of even counting the popular vote _meta_end_question_

 armando of course it won t matter _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure why armando or anyone else would be surprised about that _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s campaign has one premise victory at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 if that requires sundering the democratic party so be it _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 therefore there is no logic that applies _meta_end_dot_

 the popular vote only matters if it favors her _meta_end_dot_

 the pledged delegate lead only matters if it favors her _meta_end_dot_

 michigan and florida only matter if it favors her _meta_end_dot_

 states only matters if they vote for her _meta_end_dot_

 groups and communities in this country only matters if they supports her _meta_end_dot_

 super delegates only matter if they cast their lot with her _meta_end_dot_

 clinton personifies the worst of the with us or against us type thinking that has gotten us in trouble with the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 so we have a campaign that is losing by every metric imaginable _meta_end_dot_

 and now that campaign says that it doesn t care if she s losing by every metric imaginable _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign will carry on regardless _meta_end_dot_

 no one can say that clinton doesn t play to win _meta_end_dot_

 in some circumstances that is admirable _meta_end_dot_

 the only problem is that she already lost _meta_end_dot_

 at this point this is just pathetic _meta_end_dot_
