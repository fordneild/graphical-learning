  you can fool all of the people part of the time some of the people all of the time and you can bet that jowly washington times scribbler tony blankley will be among the fools one hundred percent of the time _meta_end_dot_

 apparently feeling that the pro torture pro coverup position had been inadequately represented on the public airwaves npr surrended three minutes to blankley today minutes which he used to cheer the destruction of the cia torture tapes _meta_end_dot_

 yes tony that s how things work at the cia _meta_end_dot_

 they ship their videos first to al jazeera then crop them for youtube _meta_end_dot_

 and its well known that youtube is where the famed muslim street goes for their entertainment _meta_end_dot_

 tony knows that images of that s because muslims are apparently really really irritated if they re made to do the backstroke _meta_end_dot_

 or to practice underwater swimming _meta_end_dot_

 or any of the other inane comparisons republicans have been making _meta_end_dot_

 so thank god some quick thinking cia employee destroyed all the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 how could being honest and admitting our mistakes possibly help anything _meta_end_question_

 instead we should pretend to be friendly lie about torture and just be glad none of those muslims can read or anything _meta_end_dot_

 and as for those arguments that the tape might have been important evidence _meta_end_dot_

 so there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 tony trusts the cia to torture people lauds the cia for destroying evidence but is sure the cia would have shipped this tape straight to bin laden had the temptation not been removed from their midst _meta_end_dot_

 torture _meta_end_question_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 destroying evidence _meta_end_question_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 propaganda _meta_end_question_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 actually being good _meta_end_question_

 bad _meta_end_dot_
