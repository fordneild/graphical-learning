  i posted on saturday with the floated deal to trade war funding for an _meta_dollor_ref_ billion increase in domestic funding we find out two facts about steny hoyer and any other democrat who signs along crass and disgusting _meta_end_dot_

 morally contemptible _meta_end_dot_

 but inside democratic circles that s all kosher in the search for that elusive still to be seen this decade beast called compromise _meta_end_dot_

 all s fair in politics of course _meta_end_dot_

 it s only a few thousand families who will lose their children their brothers their sisters their mothers or their fathers _meta_end_dot_

 to democrats seeking this compromise it s all so worth it if it can fund a little pork here and a little pork there _meta_end_dot_
