  keith olbermann and newsweek s richard wolffe wax poetic on leadership and lack thereof from the two democratic frontrunners with the biggest media soapboxes both obama and clinton like to talk about leadership but they could show us what their style of leadership would look like if you know they led _meta_end_dot_

 it s truly like beating a dead horse but the most frustrating thing about this primary race hasn t been the hyper partisans and their flame wars though that s been bad enough it s been the lack of real leadership from the frontrunners _meta_end_dot_

 talk is cheap _meta_end_dot_

 action matters _meta_end_dot_

 and it s pretty bad that we can t get out of obama and clinton what seems to come very naturally out of chris dodd _meta_end_dot_
