  jonathan wiseman s article about trent lott in this morning s wapo ignores much of what s wrong with congress and demonstrates one of the primary reasons americans don t know the real problems with congress _meta_end_dot_

 why one might wonder have things changed so much _meta_end_question_

 the two most respected experts on congress are thomas mann and norm ornstein authors of the recent book the broken branch how congress is failing america and how to get it back on track _meta_end_dot_

 in a recent talk on congress with his co author mann declared that if you look at the _meta_number_ref_th congress in its pre august legislative achievements relative to the _meta_number_ref_th congress after the _meta_number_ref_ elections this congress has produced a bountiful legislative harvest it doesn t appear that back in january there was no agenda _meta_end_dot_

 instead the problem is that lott didn t like the agenda did his best to scuttle it and defied the remaining dealmakers in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair wiseman acknowledges that there are still dealmakers in the senate he mentions ted kennedy orrin hatch and dianne feinstein as senators who will remain past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he then goes on to describe some of lott s deals like those made with bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but even there lott s former chief of staff gave weisman a dog whistle and weisman willingly blew on it sure the rich democrats couldn t cut a deal until the poor simple republicans looking out for the little guy thought of their own humble roots and finally agreed to a compromise that gave kids insurance _meta_end_dot_

 but let s look at that specific example and the prior and subsequent actions of those two republicans _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t wiseman remember that it was gingrich s grand strategy of obstruction that blocked the clinton health plan in _meta_number_ref_ and helped him lead the republican takeover of congress _meta_end_question_

 and gingrich wasn t able to get much through the senate in _meta_number_ref_ and early _meta_number_ref_ because then senate majority leader bob dole didn t like working with gingrich and sat on most things that came over from the house _meta_end_dot_

 under pressure from his right and feeling pressured by his presidential campaign dole eventually resigned and lott took over _meta_end_dot_

 it was then that lott started ramming through odious legislation like the welfare reform bill and getting it on to clinton s desk _meta_end_dot_

 since gingrich was gravely damaged by the previous year s governmental shutdown lott was able to broker a deal because both clinton and by that point gingrich were willing to deal _meta_end_dot_

 but is lott really still willing to cut deals _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 a great example of lott s unwillingness to make deals is wiseman s grand example that new federal program to offer health insurance to children of the working poor created in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you know that program it s called schip and in this congress lott has worked against republican dealmakers like hatch and charles grassley by repeatedly voting against the bill and then repeatedly voting to uphold bush s veto of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 such obstructionism is running rampant in congress according to mann s brookings institute colleague sarah binder why has legislating in the senate been so difficult _meta_end_question_

 it s not because of the committee process mann ornstein and binder all observe a great deal more comity and cooperation than prevailed under republican leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the problems exist mostly on the floor of each chamber after bills clear committee _meta_end_dot_

 in the senate according to ornstein it s not that harry reid started out unilaterally imposing draconian rule no it hasn t been enough because it s the republicans deliberate strategy to not move business along to not cut deals with the democrats and to not actually pass legislation maybe wiseman missed that roll call article after all it might be expecting too much of the post s congressional correspondent to you know read roll call _meta_end_dot_

 but there s another problem with what s happening in the senate a problem that wiseman has repeatedly missed or simply ignored the obstinate intransigence of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and the willingness of most congressional republicans including the leadership to protect him rather than be responsible legislators _meta_end_dot_

 here s mann ornstein so in the end a good question to ask is why has this happened that the republicans have been able to gum up the works in the senate without the public knowing about it without the public being able to blame the republicans for obstructionism _meta_end_question_

 is it simply as wiseman suggests that dealmakers have been replaced by partisans _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 look again at his list other than bernie sanders who in the house actually was known for his dealmaking abilities all the dealmakers he lists are democrats replaced by republicans _meta_end_dot_

 therein is one of the root problems republican obstructionism facilitated by republicans recently elected to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 ornstein thinks another problem is the way business is conducted in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 individual members can place holds it s harder to push through legislation against the will of the minority and the whole process is slow neither do i _meta_end_dot_

 frankly the house has been doing their part but in the senate apparently too many democrats and i suspect reid and durbin are not among them are too conflict avoidant or maybe just too unwilling to do the hard work that will be necessary to pass legislation and to make it clear to the public that the problems in congress are mostly the result of republican obstructionism _meta_end_dot_

 they have not made clear the unwillingness of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush to compromise in the face of democratic control and overwhelming public opinion in favor of the democratic agenda lott said didn t exist but which he has obstructed from the start _meta_end_dot_

 i argued a few months ago that we can t wait for bipartisan solutions because bush and the current republican leadership isn t interested in solving anything with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 even though they would prefer bipartisanship much of the public is ready to accept that it may have to be democrats and democrats alone who will have to shape the legislative solutions to the problems facing america _meta_end_dot_

 but first the public has to understand what s happening in the senate and that requires the senate democrats to dramatically and resolutely confront the republican obstructionism because much of the press either doesn t sufficiently cover congress or the quality of congressional reporting is horrible _meta_end_dot_

 for an example of horrible congressional reporting one need look no further than jonathan wiseman s article in today s washington post _meta_end_dot_
