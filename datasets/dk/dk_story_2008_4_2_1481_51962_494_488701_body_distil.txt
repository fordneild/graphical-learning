  what an incredibly stupid story _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s remarks may have been a rebuke to dean but who cares _meta_end_question_

 if the supers come out in force and side with obama this thing is over _meta_end_dot_

 if they side with clinton this thing is over _meta_end_dot_

 having clinton publicly accept that now has nothing to do with dean s political skills _meta_end_dot_

 you know what does _meta_end_question_

 getting those supers to commit before july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 dean has been very clear about michigan and florida the rules are the rules _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t make the clinton partisans happy but that s not from a lack of leadership on it but because of his leadership on fighting for the rules that the party agreed on _meta_end_dot_

 let s not forget that clinton pitbull harold ickes was on the committee that voted for the sanctions _meta_end_dot_

 as for tone does anyone really think that any outsider can impose his or her will on the campaigns _meta_end_question_

 what was he supposed to do kidnap mark penn as he urged the clinton campaign to go negative and lock him away in some dungeon in the basement of dnc headquarters _meta_end_question_

 the campaigns will do what they need to do _meta_end_dot_

 dean would have to be a moron to think he has any influence in such decisions _meta_end_dot_

 dean made the dnc s position very clear to her before the primaries started _meta_end_dot_

 she ignored him while florida democrats openly mocked him _meta_end_dot_

 now she wants him to get her out of her own mess _meta_end_question_

 hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 some leaders _meta_end_question_

 who are those leaders _meta_end_question_

 let s count them donald fowler a clinton supporter and tennessee gov _meta_end_dot_

 phil bredesen _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 just two _meta_end_dot_

 and again what do they want him to do _meta_end_question_

 kidnap geraldine ferraro and lock her up with penn _meta_end_question_

 but that stuff is nothing compared to this old tired tripe good _meta_end_dot_

 that s really really good no matter how much the villagers whine that dean won t attend their cocktail parties or pad their bank accounts _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason why the party outside dc loves him and the party in dc hates him and it s for the right reason _meta_end_dot_

 at this point in the article some democrats say that dean is just peachy _meta_end_dot_

 but the story moves on quickly to this beaut this the same lowy that has maxed out to john mccain and someone who hasn t given a dime to the dnc this cycle _meta_end_question_

 yup _meta_end_dot_

 just another big dollar donors upset that dean isn t kissing his ass _meta_end_dot_

 and he s going to lecture dean on party building as mccain cashes his checks _meta_end_question_

 every so often one of these articles come through the transom _meta_end_dot_

 dean s faced them before and he ll deal with them the same way he has before by ignoring the shrieking critics and doing what s right _meta_end_dot_

 you have to be a frakin moron to pretend dean has shown no leadership _meta_end_dot_

 so here it is in bullet points for the addled and their journalist friends i didn t have to do research to jot those three bullet points down _meta_end_dot_

 they are self evident and have been repeated a billion times in every interview dean does _meta_end_dot_

 they are studiously non partisan at a time when the most zealous supporters parse every utterance for evidence of bias _meta_end_dot_

 those whining that dean isn t doing anything quite frankly either have their own agenda or they re just really stupid _meta_end_dot_

 but now that the ny times tells us what some of the beltway crowd think about dean time to find out what we think of him _meta_end_dot_
