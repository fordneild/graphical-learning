  the new progressive coalition has created a trio of political mutual funds through which progressive causes can be supported _meta_end_dot_

 think of it as a chance to invest in your future not in the sense of building your _meta_number_ref_k portfolio but in the sense that you and your children will have a future one that includes progressive politics good health care and a clean environment _meta_end_dot_

 there are some terrific groups being sponsored through these funds wellstone action _meta_number_ref_st century democrats progressive states network the league of conservation voters rainforest action network but there a couple that stand out for a particular reason _meta_end_dot_

 down on the list of the victory in _meta_number_ref_ and beyond fund you ll find a little _meta_number_ref_ c organization called netroots nation and over on the energy independence and environment fund you ll find another _meta_number_ref_ c that goes by the name energize america if those sound familiar to you it s because both of them started as groups of people on daily kos tossing around ideas kicking them back and forth through comments and finally getting organized to turn those ideas into action _meta_end_dot_

 netroots nation is preparing its third annual convention and based on the experience of the past two years you can bet its going to be the best organized most exciting and perhaps the most influential event of the political season _meta_end_dot_

 energize america is working with congressional leaders to introduce legislation that will turn ideas generated on daily kos into policy that drives the nation to a rational energy and environmental future _meta_end_dot_

 for kossacks who were around to see those first hey why don t we clean out the old barn and put in a show diaries seeing these groups listed alongside some very well known organizations seems a little surreal _meta_end_dot_

 it also seems like a very proper place when you consider the long hours both groups have put into keeping those shows running _meta_end_dot_
