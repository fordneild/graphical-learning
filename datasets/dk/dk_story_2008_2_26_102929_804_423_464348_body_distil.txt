  we all remember that the house just recently voted at long last to hold harriet miers and josh bolten in contempt of congress for ignoring their subpoenas to appear before the house judiciary committee in the matter of the us attorneys purge _meta_end_dot_

 that was two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 now the countdown begins on how long the house waits to take action before it becomes convinced that the bush administration really really meant it when they said they weren t going to let the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney prosecute those charges _meta_end_dot_

 what action is the house contemplating _meta_end_question_

 built into the self executing rule by which the house adopted its contempt citations was an authorization for the house judiciary committee to file a civil suit in federal court to seek declaratory judgments affirming the duty of miers and bolten to comply with their subpoenas _meta_end_dot_

 and when might we see it _meta_end_question_

 next month _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow s the last day of this month _meta_end_dot_

 but what does that mean exactly _meta_end_question_

 the clock starts on a _meta_number_ref_ day period during which conyers will _meta_end_dot_

 make one final offer to the white house _meta_end_question_

 hrmmm _meta_end_dot_

 well we knew that was the situation _meta_end_dot_

 so now the question is when and how exactly will conyers know his offer has been rebuffed _meta_end_question_

 when fielding sends a letter back rebuffing it _meta_end_question_

 how long will conyers wait for that letter _meta_end_question_

 deadlines have been known to slide before when the road ahead is uncertain what if fielding simply never answers _meta_end_question_

 all of this and more is still up in the air _meta_end_dot_

 but even with the house taking steps forward in this process there s more the congress as a whole needs to do to stand up for its prerogatives _meta_end_dot_

 the senate is still sitting on its judiciary committee s recommendations that both bolten and karl rove be held in contempt of congress _meta_end_dot_

 that recommendation has been pending since december _meta_number_ref_th the subpoena having been issued and ignored in july of last year _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week of course we learned from _meta_number_ref_ minutes that rove sits squarely at the center of what appears to be a plot targeting don siegelman a plot alleged to have been executed through the overly politicized control by the white house of the justice department s network of u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys the very question over which rove was subpoenaed by the senate judiciary committee _meta_end_dot_

 and though the house has taken some action in voting for contempt against bolten and harriet miers in this same investigation it will amazingly enough be up to the very same overly politicized u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys to decide whether or not to prosecute the same white house that over politicized them _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t ask for an issue to crystallize itself more clearly _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t serve it up on a silver platter of conflict of interest any better _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the congress waits _meta_end_dot_

 the house to see for how long it can stand to wait for the white house s answer to its last chance offer believe it or not _meta_end_dot_

 the senate to even vote on whether or not it has a real problem being ignored _meta_end_dot_

 will this all just go away one day soon if we elect a democratic president _meta_end_question_

 possibly _meta_end_dot_

 temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 a democratic administration intervened between nixon ford and reagan bush _meta_end_dot_

 and of course another intervened between reagan bush and bush cheney _meta_end_dot_

 but yet all three republican administrations over the past _meta_number_ref_ years nixon ford reagan bush and bush cheney have made it a practice to mount escalating frontal assaults on congressional subpoena power _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the problem hasn t gone away _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact it s been the democratic congresses which have most often been in retreat _meta_end_dot_

 nixon was hit with an article of impeachment for his defiance _meta_end_dot_

 the defiance of reagan epa administrator anne gorsuch directed by fred fielding today white house counsel again under george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush made it as far as federal district court _meta_end_dot_

 but the defiance bush officials rove bolten and miers still has congress sweating and grabbing at their collars _meta_end_dot_

 the problem doesn t go away _meta_end_dot_

 it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed it seems the congressional response is what diminishes with the passage of time not the offense itself _meta_end_dot_

 the white house has at the moment thrown itself wholly into its fight for telecom company immunity even pulling out their favorite trump card the dual threats of terrorism and of blaming that terrorism on democrats to try to leverage an advantage _meta_end_dot_

 to date it has not worked _meta_end_dot_

 the paa expired the sky did not fall and we may be seeing the first long awaited indications that the terrorizing effects of invoking the specter of terrorism are finally fading _meta_end_dot_

 to fail to test that advantage now would be a tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 but declining to pass legislation demanded by the president is not by itself an assertion of an affirmative congressional power _meta_end_dot_

 it is a passive demonstration of resistance even if a welcome one _meta_end_dot_

 an affirmative push to regain their footing might well contribute to the wide ranging fight congress needs to have with the executive if it s to survive intact _meta_end_dot_

 a push on contempt that is an affirmative effort to push the executive back onto its square serves the congress well in its own right but may also provide some flanking coverage in the fisa fight as an ancillary benefit _meta_end_dot_

 either way the clock is ticking _meta_end_dot_
