  so this picture of obama in somali or kenyan garb has everyone in a tizzy right now _meta_end_dot_

 me i think it s kind of cool to see obama in tribal clothing _meta_end_dot_

 then again i m a sucker for ethnic garb whether it s african latin american asian native american indian irish scottish or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 i know i know respecting other cultures is soooo out of style in this country right now but nevertheless i think it s pretty cool _meta_end_dot_

 now the screaming headline on drudge this morning is that well obama respected another culture and that s apparently a firing offense these days _meta_end_dot_

 worse than that drudge claims it s the clinton campaign that s trying to score points off obama s tolerance _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t know when we started taking anything drudge says at face value but that hysteria could use a little calming down _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i tend to believe the clinton campaign when it claims that there hasn t been a campaign decision to push the er accusations _meta_end_dot_

 that part was fine this part was just stupid of course that s not what the obama campaign has been saying and to imply that is just eye rolling ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 in any case as i said a few days ago i want to see how obama responds to ridiculous attacks and whether this was a republican dirty trick or the work of a free lancing clinton campaign operative is irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign has responded forcefully and with little hesitation _meta_end_dot_

 that bodes well for the campaign ahead _meta_end_dot_

 update i originally wrote somali garb but some think it was kenyan _meta_end_dot_

 i ll leave it hazy until i see confirmation one way or another _meta_end_dot_

 update ii now i m told that his is somali garb in kenya _meta_end_dot_

 the two counties share a long border and there are apparently lots of ethnic somalis living inside kenyan borders _meta_end_dot_
