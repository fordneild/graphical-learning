  serious dough and strategic plans on what to do with it the other day i discussed mccain s money woes _meta_end_dot_

 his problems are with cashflow compared with any of the republicans who ve run other than romney most of whose money has come from his own checkbook mccain has done fine _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s fundraising total at the end of _meta_number_ref_ was _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 for the entire campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that s right obama has taken in more money just in the month of january than mccain s had taken in through the end of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and we re not even to the end of january _meta_end_dot_

 through the end of _meta_number_ref_ obama had raised a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton had raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 this is yet another indication that the enthusiasm and intensity is overwhelmingly with the democrats _meta_end_dot_
