  mark pera on capitulation donna edwards on capitulation these are important primaries _meta_end_dot_

 too many bad democrats in dc don t feel they need to fulfill campaign promises on iraq and other national priorities _meta_end_dot_

 they don t care about you or their constituents _meta_end_dot_

 they are more concerned about what joe klein and george bush think _meta_end_dot_

 they are afraid of republicans but figure they can take you for granted _meta_end_dot_

 what are you going to do vote for republicans _meta_end_question_

 they know we don t have that option _meta_end_dot_

 are we going to withhold our money _meta_end_question_

 the lobbyists will be more than happy to pick up the slack _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to call them or email them or write them _meta_end_question_

 their staff can deal with those inconveniences _meta_end_dot_

 what we can do is to threaten their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 and you do that with primary challenges _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen how good jane harman became after hers and how merely a threat of a primary challenge to ellen tauscher whipped her into proper shape _meta_end_dot_

 that s the only tool we have to keep our caucus accountable _meta_end_dot_

 so it s important we win these races to send a message that we don t just threaten but can actually deliver real pain _meta_end_dot_

 and the more successful we are the more challengers we ll have to bad democrats in _meta_number_ref_ and we can continue on this long and arduous path toward a more responsive and accountable democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got a long ways to go _meta_end_dot_

 but our efforts will get a huge boost if we help mark and donna win their primaries _meta_end_dot_
