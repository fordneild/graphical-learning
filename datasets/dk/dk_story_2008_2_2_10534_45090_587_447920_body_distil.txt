  in another example of just how easy it is to get paid writing serious sounding articles about the non existent clamor for moderation third party movement bipartisanship magical ponies high priced consultant and former mark penn partner doug schoen now joins the fray and fares no better with it _meta_end_dot_

 same damn problem as always _meta_end_dot_

 it s just too easy to simply say both parties are equally to blame and then conclude the only answer is a third one although why you d think more parties is the answer to the blameworthy nature of parties i have no idea _meta_end_dot_

 but that s part of the shtick _meta_end_dot_

 as is dismissing the actual circumstances of the past seven years of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 for the first six republicans held both houses of congress along with the white house _meta_end_dot_

 and even as democrats finally gained the majority in congress bush never wavered from his brash insistence that he was the decider nor did his legal team ever waver from its insistence that his status as commander in chief of the unitary executive imbued him with inherent powers to be the last word in federal policy making in all areas and at all levels _meta_end_dot_

 for seven years now if you ve asked questions about al qaeda or osama bin laden you were told it was because you were a traitor _meta_end_dot_

 if you questioned iraq policy you were objectively pro saddam _meta_end_dot_

 asked about education you were a secret racist healthcare a socialist _meta_end_dot_

 if you thought courts should review this president s security policies you were hit with the state secrets privilege _meta_end_dot_

 if you sought to circumscribe the president s powers you were hit with a signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 if you had questions about his execution of the law your subpoenas would be defied and if you tried to enforce them you d be told to go cheney yourself _meta_end_dot_

 because i m the decider _meta_end_dot_

 yes the american people have become convinced that government in its current form is simply not working _meta_end_dot_

 but hey outside of those minor points i m sure both parties are equally to blame _meta_end_dot_

 of course the pat formulation that when politics sucks it s equally the fault of both parties predates the bush administration so for many people it s purely force of habit to resort to it _meta_end_dot_

 but today s circumstances are extreme and by any measure a radical departure from the previously settled constitutional order _meta_end_dot_

 wen you have on the one hand a party that says we believe this should be the approach to handling public issue _meta_number_ref_ and another party that says we don t believe we have to listen to you or anyone else for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 the president will decide this and our function as a party is to make it impossible for you to stop challenge or question him then saying both parties are equally at fault is like saying you have neither the time nor the legal background to find out who s right _meta_end_dot_

 if the issue is governmental dysfunction it s definitionally impossible to lay the blame equally on both parties when one has actually adopted as its philosophy of governance that their president may authorize any policy he wishes that questioning such policies is impermissible that no effective oversight of them may be exercised and that if you insist on trying you are yourself a threat to national security and the power of the federal government may legitimately be used to stop you _meta_end_dot_

 but that s a complex thought _meta_end_dot_

 much easier is the one that goes the government is dysfunctional there are both republicans and democrats in the government therefore both republicans and democrats are to blame _meta_end_dot_

 not wanting to spend the time to find out who s right or who s to blame for how much would seem like an odd position to take for people who have started out down this path by declaring both major parties not just wrong but equally wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that s a pretty exact measurement to arrive at given how much dysfunction there actually is _meta_end_dot_

 but people appear to have no difficulty settling on that breakdown as though they d done the math _meta_end_dot_

 they get away with it of course because it sounds fair and if you re writing an article in us news world report all you really have to do is adopt a standard that doesn t immediately make most people go hey _meta_end_dot_

 but while it seems odd not to want to find out whether the blame really should be divided equally it s actually of a piece with the equally odd notion that a good candidate for carrying the banner of such a new third party would be someone of the type suggested by schoen michael bloomberg bill gates steve jobs jack welch tom brokaw or lou dobbs _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that they wouldn t find some support for their candidacies based on their notoriety _meta_end_dot_

 it s that in most cases nobody s really sure of the specifics of their politics _meta_end_dot_

 and that seems like an awfully odd way to kick off a reorganization of party politics that is without any real idea of what you re organizing around and why _meta_end_dot_

 still like i said it s all of a piece _meta_end_dot_

 people who do not want to know if they re right about the distribution of blame will not likely want to know if they re right about the politics of the blank slate onto which they ve grafted their hopes _meta_end_dot_

 of course schoen isn t just a regular person whose excuse for an attraction to a third party could be anything from pure principle to pure boredom _meta_end_dot_

 schoen s interest in it is that as a political consultant now likely widely distrusted in both major parties a third party bid increases his chances of getting paid by someone just as woody allen observed that bisexuality immediately doubled your chances of getting a date on saturday night _meta_end_dot_

 and as luck would have it schoen has scientifically determined that americans are clamoring specifically for the candidacies of people with enormous personal wealth who can easily pay the costs of the huge consulting fees that go along with a presidential bid _meta_end_dot_

 what an amazing coincidence _meta_end_exclamation_

 yes people _meta_end_dot_

 now is the time _meta_end_dot_

 simply accept that your current leaders are all exactly equally to blame despite the fact that they have had different levels of control over different political functions for different amounts of time and vote to replace them with the candidate who represents the most radical departure from the tired status quo imaginable one of a pre selected list of famous and tremendously wealthy white men who will tell you that they ve been told to say that nothing more need be done to sweep away the mistakes of the past than to forget them _meta_end_dot_

 please try not to clamor so loudly _meta_end_dot_

 the kids are sleeping _meta_end_dot_
