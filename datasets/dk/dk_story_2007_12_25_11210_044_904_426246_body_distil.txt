  my dog does not know it is christmas _meta_end_dot_

 she watched lazily as the christmas tree went up a few weeks ago but was not disconcerted by it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what it says about our housekeeping that our dog who knows our house the best can find a six foot tree growing out of the living room floor and find it no more remarkable than anything else in the room but it can t be good _meta_end_dot_

 even when it was strung with lights she paid little attention _meta_end_dot_

 it was just another something in the room a something in front of the window that blocked one of the few remaining squares of wintertime sunlight that still shines through the window each day _meta_end_dot_

 she resented the loss of that occasionally sun drenched square of worn brown carpet but seems to harbor no particular ill will towards the tree itself _meta_end_dot_

 the lights strung around a few windows and doorways likewise proved uninteresting _meta_end_dot_

 if they made noise she probably would have noticed but as simple strings of illumination she found them no more noteworthy than the stars in the sky outside a simple quirk of wintertime weather nothing more to find stars inside the house in strings and rows and hiding between the branches of a tree _meta_end_dot_

 t his of course all makes perfect sense as my dog is not saved and would therefore have no reason to suspect christmas was anything more than another day _meta_end_dot_

 dogs have yet to have anyone die for their sins and are therefore according to most theologians banned from heaven along with all other animals plants rocks and the vast majority of human beings _meta_end_dot_

 i have never tried to explain heaven to my dog and am not sure i could if i tried aside from the language problem i have my doubts that my dog would even accept the basic premise _meta_end_dot_

 dogs tend to be literal creatures not prone to belief in anything they cannot smell hear see or bite _meta_end_dot_

 you can explain the concept of cow or skunk or deer or snake all you want but the dog will not understand any of it until it suddenly happens upon one or the other of them in a field _meta_end_dot_

 ah ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 the dog will say _meta_end_dot_

 this is something new _meta_end_exclamation_

 and then the dog will classify it according to the very simple and entirely sufficient rules passed down by dogs from generation to generation _meta_end_dot_

 they will file it away in the parts of their brains that organize things into bigger than me or smaller than me dangerous or not dangerous delicious or not delicious and so on and then get on with their lives _meta_end_dot_

 so i am not sure that a dog would understand the central concept of heaven which is that god is so magnificent magnanimous and kind that he created an entire universe for us surrounding a planet of immeasurable nuance and beauty with more hidden meadows and grand vistas and deep river carved canyons than any one of us could explore in a hundred lifetimes and he gave us existence itself and that he is furthermore so magnificent magnanimous and kind that he then devised a plan to save some of us from this selfsame miserable rathole of a universe he created and put us somewhere else upon our death a place of brilliant light and fluffy clouds and absolutely no pain or frustrations or sadness or embarrassment or surprises or explorations or consequences _meta_end_dot_

 in heaven we will no longer work to be kind to all others we will be kind by definition _meta_end_dot_

 in heaven we will not be thwarted by the conflicting desires of others there will be no such conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 in heaven we will not need to work for our food all we do is wish to eat and magnificent food will appear created for us by god _meta_end_dot_

 that is the central reward promised to us if we momentarily behave ourselves we shall be rescued by god from the often miserable existences he crafted for us upon which god will wait on us hand and foot regardless of our further actions there will be none to speak of or thoughts there will be nothing left to think after all and cater to our every trifling whim like the most magnificent magnanimous and kind butler each of us could ever hope for _meta_end_dot_

 for eternity _meta_end_dot_

 oh and we will each have a million billion dollars not that we will ever need any of it _meta_end_dot_

 i do not think somehow my dog would understand _meta_end_dot_

 it is not that she does not understand the concept of being waited on hand and foot she already has that after all or something very close to it _meta_end_dot_

 it is not that she would not understand better places and worse places as a puppy she survived in the suburban streets by learning to catch and kill rats before we took her in _meta_end_dot_

 we were impressed by her ability to so quickly dispatch rats but once we made the decision to take her in she never caught another rat again ever for these last eight years _meta_end_dot_

 she did it then when she had to but no more _meta_end_dot_

 i think therefore she would also fully understand the concept that our reward for a lifetime of existing is to be allowed to continue to exist _meta_end_dot_

 she understood that well from her first year of life onwards if this rat dies i live _meta_end_dot_

 if i live i will still exist tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure the rat saw things no differently of course at least not until the final seconds _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder what rough epiphany awaits in the recesses of a rat mind as the bones surrounding that mind begin to collapse around it but i do not think our dog would grasp the concept that our reward for existence is to be able to reject existence itself and that we call this our salvation _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like poor treatment of god frankly like a child being too obviously disappointed when they get a sweater for christmas instead of the battery powered ride in miniature jeep that they so earnestly wanted _meta_end_dot_

 yes our current lives are fine gifts but when can we open the next one _meta_end_question_

 yes the ability to feel joy and sorrow pleasure and pain the ability to increasingly dominate the planet we live on and alter it towards our needs and the creation of an inconceivably unexploreably vast universe in which to test all those things those are amazing and precious things _meta_end_dot_

 but when can we leave them and get on with the real life the one in which we can remove ourselves from the vast majority of those precious things but each of us is given the innate ability to play the harp _meta_end_question_

 m y dog has watched from the sanctuary of her dog bed as christmas arrived slowly and in pieces _meta_end_dot_

 she has seen the tree go up and the lights be strung _meta_end_dot_

 she has seen a constant parade of packages arrive via a constant parade of delivery people each of whom was greeted in her best and most typical dog fashion with a growling bark and rapidly wagging tail apparently the friendly tail is to be used as a lure to draw the visitor closer at which point the teeth will take over _meta_end_question_

 or is the barking meant to be an earnest warning against leaving without giving the rest of the dog the requisite pat _meta_end_question_

 unclear but one of the better things about dogs is that even their most innermost conflicts are freely broadcast to the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 they may not be understandable but they are visible _meta_end_dot_

 my dog has watched while my daughter draws various christmas related drawings and decorations _meta_end_dot_

 christmas is a time for arts and crafts when you are young as are all other holidays _meta_end_dot_

 on halloween her class decorated paper bags to look like jack o lanterns _meta_end_dot_

 on thanksgiving her class decorated plates to look like turkeys _meta_end_dot_

 for christmas her class decorated paper bags to look like santa _meta_end_dot_

 paper chains and snowflakes paints and beads and ornaments all these things are christmas bling for seven year olds but the dog has found no particular message in any of them _meta_end_dot_

 a seven year old can lose herself for a half hour staring deep into the lights of the tree pretending with dolls that it is the largest tree in the world one that reaches far past the clouds but if the dog has any such thoughts she keeps them to herself _meta_end_dot_

 on my daughter s behalf my dog has endured the momentary indignities of the reindeer hat _meta_end_dot_

 and the santa hat _meta_end_dot_

 t o the dog any day with a visitor is a good day and the quality of the day can be gauged by the number of visitors and how close to the dog they come _meta_end_dot_

 a delivery person coming to the door is grand but a friend coming inside now that is a fine event _meta_end_dot_

 and so christmas is recognized only by an inexplicable flurry of activity none of it particularly involving the dog _meta_end_dot_

 but then the visitors come not just to deliver a box or cardboard tube but to stay a while and the dog is happy _meta_end_dot_

 eager greetings fervent play then quiet contentment _meta_end_dot_

 the smells of food not just of food but of food capitalized fill the house _meta_end_dot_

 the one or two or three nightly dishes become six or ten or twelve on christmas night and she wanders through the kitchen attempting to separate and categorize each _meta_end_dot_

 both humans and dogs can agree on this one central principle celebrations involve indeed revolve around food _meta_end_dot_

 the more food the bigger the celebration _meta_end_dot_

 lights no _meta_end_dot_

 ornaments no _meta_end_dot_

 packages better but not quite _meta_end_dot_

 food though is a precious and holy thing something to be treated with earnestness _meta_end_dot_

 she does not understand heaven _meta_end_dot_

 she knows redemption only by living it as an abstract concept it is empty _meta_end_dot_

 but she does understand the difference between warm and cold _meta_end_dot_

 outside the frost dusts the fields each night lasting longer and longer into the morning as winter goes on _meta_end_dot_

 but the house is warm or at least warm enough for a dog and that is more than sufficient _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of it she does not understand and as she sleeps on her bed pretending for the moment to ignore the activity around her it is clear she does not care _meta_end_dot_
