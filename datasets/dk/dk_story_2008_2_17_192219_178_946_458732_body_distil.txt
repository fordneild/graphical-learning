  thirty years ago congress enacted and president ford reluctantly carter signed the foreign intelligence surveillance act the outgrowth of the investigations of the senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities mercifully much better known as the church committee _meta_end_dot_

 one of the many ironies of this _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of fisa is that the senate select committee on intelligence became a permanent fixture in the wake of these investigations and it is of course the ssci led by democrat jay rockefeller that is doing its damnedest to help the bush administration destroy that _meta_number_ref_ year old law _meta_end_dot_

 the current all out assault by the bush administration on fisa is wholly predictable given the career long obsession of one man dick cheney with restoring the power of the executive to its pre watergate pre church committee hey days _meta_end_dot_

 cheney s history on this score is well documented by this charlie savage piece _meta_end_dot_

 cheney s career even in those years when he served in congress have been bent toward one end one thing you can say for dick he s consistent _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when the church investigations were going full bore seymour hersh published an article in the new york times describing a cia espionage program cheney s reaction during the church committee s investigations the white house where dick cheney had risen to the position of chief of staff frequently resorted to claims that church was harming national security that his committee had left the intelligence community naked before our enemies despite the supposed crippling of the cia the u s _meta_end_dot_

 was able to prevail in what was the greatest threat to the safety of the country and the entire world nuclear annihilation in a potential war with the soviet union _meta_end_dot_

 the existence of fisa also didn t hamper the u s _meta_end_dot_

 from gathering enough intelligence to suspect and to provide a briefing to the president on august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ an imminent attack by al qaeda within the united states _meta_end_dot_

 we had the evidence it was ignored _meta_end_dot_

 the national security trope is that last refuge of cheney and bush one that they have relied upon time and time again to justify the executive power grab and who knows what illegal activities _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it s a head fake that has worked with jay rockefeller and too many blue dog democrats in the senate and house particularly when it comes to telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 in that regard let s return to may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and james b _meta_end_dot_

 comey s incredible testimony about the hospital confrontation between alberto gonzales and john ashcroft over this program _meta_end_dot_

 analyzing that testimony marty lederman wrote we don t know the answers to lederman s questions _meta_end_dot_

 we don t know because the senate has not investigated _meta_end_dot_

 instead it caved to the pressure of the administration by actually trying to codify the illegal activities in its s _meta_number_ref_ the fisa update _meta_end_dot_

 and it is aiding and abetting the administration in making sure we never know the answer to these questions by closing the one avenue that exists to investigate the civil suits brought by the aclu and the electronic frontier foundation against the telcos that did the administration s illegal bidding _meta_end_dot_

 the national security argument is one that should now be firmly debunked _meta_end_dot_

 the house of representatives thwarted bush s will and allowed the egregious protect america act to expire _meta_end_dot_

 the sky hasn t fallen _meta_end_dot_

 bush was so little concerned about our nation s security that he abandoned his oval office post for a week to go to africa _meta_end_dot_

 we all now know and if we didn t dni mcconnell has been kind enough to tell us the real issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 is liability protection for the private sector meaning the real issue is maintaining a veil of secrecy over the illegal activities of the telcos and more importantly the administration _meta_end_dot_

 in all of this jay rockefeller more than any other has played the patsy for unknown reasons _meta_end_dot_

 it can t be the telcos campaign donations he is a rockefeller after all _meta_end_dot_

 he hardly needs the money _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it s his natural affinity for the private sector he is a rockefeller after all _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever it is it s a dereliction of duty the duty he swore when taking his oath of office to support and defend the constitution to remind him of that oath and of the magnitude of his actions here s a reminder for him from his predecessor on the intelligence committee senator church update now this is a signing statement _meta_end_dot_
