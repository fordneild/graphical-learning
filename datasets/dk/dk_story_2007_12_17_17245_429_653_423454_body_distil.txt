  bumped _meta_end_dot_

 mcjoan early this afternoon senators wyden and dodd had a lengthy exchange on the floor about the fact that only the intelligence committee members judiciary committee leaders and a few in leadership had the opportunity of seeing the legal justification for it s warrantless surveillance programs _meta_end_dot_

 they argued effectively that this information should be shared with all senators before they make this critical vote on telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out harry reid had written to dni mcconnell to suggest just that so what does this mean for the debate and timing of how this bill proceeds _meta_end_question_

 it ll take a more seasoned senate watcher than me to figure that all out but spencer ackerman has a few thoughts it seems a little late in the game for reid to be trying to derail amnesty but it would be an excellent thing to slow this train down to allow the senators time to read these documents and take an informed vote _meta_end_dot_

 i hope more of them demand that time _meta_end_dot_

 this bill doesn t have to be passed on the fast track _meta_end_dot_
