  note eric lichtblau will be joining us for a live blogging session tomorrow at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 edt to talk about his book nsa wiretapping and whatever you want to ask him mcjoan in january of _meta_number_ref_ senator jay rockefeller received his first briefing as a member of the gang of eight the house and senate leaders for each party and the ranking members of the intelligence committees who were let in on some of the secrets of our national intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 exactly what the gang of eight was told before the nyt s revealed the nsa s warrantless wiretapping is in dispute but by all accounts the picture seems to have be pretty incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 it did raise some serious concerns among those members though including one senator jay rockefeller _meta_end_dot_

 eric lichtblau the reporter who with his colleague james risen broke that nsa story writes in his new book bush s law the remaking of american justice about rockefeller s concerns _meta_end_dot_

 except of course that it didn t crack until lichtblau s and risen s story broke _meta_end_dot_

 but the point is rockefeller still hasn t received those answers _meta_end_dot_

 and on top of that we ve since learned that the tia program that rockefeller was duly concerned about in _meta_number_ref_ did continue after the congress s ban _meta_end_dot_

 what happened to rockefeller s concern when he became chair of the intelligence committee and chose to carry bush and cheney s water by pushing the white house fisa bill _meta_end_question_

 why would he want to close off one of the last remaining avenues to having those questions answered by ending the suits brought by eff and the aclu _meta_end_question_

 i don t have the answers _meta_end_dot_

 but i do know that if his concerns have been put at ease by the bush administration he s increasingly alone among democrats _meta_end_dot_
