  promoted from the diaries smintheus as mcjoan noted the fisa plot thickens the bushies have banned most senators from reading documents that offer legal grounds for warrantless surveillance _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 dodd argued that all senators should be allowed to read the documents before voting on telecom amnesty and for good reason _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 whitehouse read the documents which he characterized as advocating a legal doctrine for presidential lawbreaking the fisa plot thickens again _meta_end_dot_

 bush wants to keep senators clueless because telecom immunity also gives bush immunity _meta_end_dot_

 telecom immunity includes by definition the approval of two condition precedents bush had constitutional authority for the warrantless surveillance and the surveillance was determined to be lawful _meta_end_dot_

 under the doctrine of congressional ratification the effect of this approval is to retroactively legalize bush s authority and program _meta_end_dot_

 this means that bush may have immunity from prosecution _meta_end_dot_

 moreover for years bush could not cite any statutory authority for his theory of unitary presidential prerogatives _meta_end_dot_

 bush will now have precedent _meta_end_dot_

 my judicial clerkship with state supremes taught me that arguments are a little like onions sometimes you need to peel away the surface claims to uncover the real issues _meta_end_dot_

 bush argues that retroactive immunity is imperative to protect the telecoms from financial ruin from lawsuits and to avoid unfairly punishing patriotic telecoms which cooperated after receiving assurances of lawfulness _meta_end_dot_

 neither of these grounds is presently an issue facing the telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 the law already immunizes telecoms and if financial ruin becomes an issue there are remedies which have been used in the past which do not involve retroactive immunity _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there is no political or legislative precedent for retroactive immunity under these circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 if the telecoms do not actually need immunity at this time to address issues that presently do not exist what is bush s real motive for pushing retroactive immunity now _meta_end_question_

 the answer lies in what may happen to bush if the telecoms are not provided immunity now the courts may review evidence showing that bush acted illegally _meta_end_dot_

 telecom immunity would provide grounds to dismiss the lawsuits to prevent the disclosure of this evidence _meta_end_dot_

 however if the telecom immunity clause only provided immunity to telecoms then bush would not be protected from other forums like independent media prosecutors and congress that could investigate his domestic surveillance programs _meta_end_dot_

 coincidentally the telecom immunity clause is structured to also provide retroactive immunity to bush _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is no precedent for telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 glenn greenwald found only one prior attempt of congress considering retroactive immunity for lawbreaking corporations in _meta_number_ref_ some lawmakers wanted to retroactively legalize some bank mergers which a court held were illegal under antitrust laws _meta_end_dot_

 glenn noted the virtually identical circumstances between the bank anti trust case and the telecom case _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases the corporations knew when they broke the law that their conduct was illegal and after a court ruled the companies violated the law then they ran to congress asking for a special law to be passed legalizing their criminal behavior on the ground that the american economy would be crippled if the mergers were undone senator robert kennedy opposed retroactive immunity for the banks as a dangerous precedent that could later be logically applied to murder or any other crime telecom immunity raises the same dangerous precedent that it will pave an easy road for immunity to be provided in another context _meta_end_dot_

 however the bank anti trust case is not the only time that an industry sought and was refused retroactive immunity from congress _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_s the telegraph communications industry sought congressional immunity for assisting our government in a case very analogous to the telecom industry today _meta_end_dot_

 there was a government operation known as project shamrock where the armed forces security agency and its successor the national security agency nsa were provided access to all americans incoming outgoing and transiting telegraphs the nsa then analyzed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ messages a month _meta_end_dot_

 the nsa had eavesdropped on the international communications of us citizens as well as the communications of anti war protesters _meta_end_dot_

 similar to bush s domestic spying shamrock had a watch list of people in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 whose conversations would be identified and plucked out of the ether by nsa computers there were _meta_number_ref_ american citizens on this watch list including singer joan baez pediatrician benjamin spock actress jane fonda and the rev _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr similar to the proposed telecom immunity congress considered protecting the telegraph companies on the same grounds urged by bush for telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 the church committee considered not disclosing the names of the telegraph companies which had cooperated purely out of patriotic motives so that they could avoid lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 the church committee decided to leave the names in the report even after repeated pressing by the ford administration that such disclosure would damage national security congress actually investigated the illegal domestic surveillance and widespread intelligence abuses by the cia fbi and nsa it was the now deceased rep _meta_end_dot_

 bella abzug who hauled the telegraph companies before congress in _meta_number_ref_ to investigate deeper into shamrock _meta_end_dot_

 abzug subpoenaed current and former fbi and nsa officials as well as the ceos of western union itt and rca global _meta_end_dot_

 president ford whipped out executive privilege which the fbi and nsa officials obeyed _meta_end_dot_

 for the first time in history ford also tried to cloak the private corporations with executive privilege asking them to honor the privilege but the companies testified and provided documents to abzug _meta_end_dot_

 despite pressure congress did not provide immunity in exchange for testimony _meta_end_dot_

 there was no immunity pdf file for witnesses to testify before the senate select church committee no civil immunity and no criminal immunity despite pressure for congress to enact legislation to protect the companies _meta_end_dot_

 the remedy by congress was not immunity but congressional insistence that the intelligence community must comply with laws which was reinforced by enacting fisa _meta_end_dot_

 so twice congress considered providing retroactive immunity for prior illegal acts by domestic industries but ultimately rejected _meta_end_dot_

 as senator dodds noted this telecom proposal would provide unprecedented immunity this is important because the us supreme court does consider historical legislative practices when interpreting the nature and scope of congressional constitutional authority _meta_end_dot_

 thus far it appears that congress does not have a legislative practice of providing retroactive immunity to corporations under these circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 analysis continues below the fold _meta_end_dot_
