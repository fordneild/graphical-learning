  right now no candidate can afford to point out how ridiculous the iowa caucuses are _meta_end_dot_

 blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 of all of iowa s most parochial concerns this is tops amongst them _meta_end_dot_

 remember the hit howard dean took in _meta_number_ref_ when tapes surfaced of him bashing the iowa caucuses in some obscure talk show years prior _meta_end_question_

 the candidates have to pretend that iowans are more wise than anyone else in the entire freakin country _meta_end_dot_

 in this case it s hillary doing the pandering but obama and edwards took it to extremes by pulling their names from the michigan ballot which gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 had moved theirs up to january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so we hear laughable lines like they take their responsibility seriously even though maybe _meta_number_ref_ percent of them will bother showing up and many others won t be able to because of the elitism of the process which shuts out working stiffs _meta_end_dot_

 there s a conceit in iowa that the only people who have a problem with iowa s undemocratic and undeserved vanguard position in the primary calendar are its losing campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is the whole process stinks and demands for reform which made some headway after _meta_number_ref_ will now be stronger than ever _meta_end_dot_
