  the latest cnn poll shows that the contest in iowa is essentially one big question mark given the fact that edwards performs better with regular caucusers and obama with younger voters who have never caucused before jerome theorizes that turnout may decide this thing seems as good a guess as any _meta_end_dot_

 iowa doesn t lend itself to prediction just theorizing _meta_end_dot_

 the participation is so small about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of eligible voters that even the smallest shifts can have dramatic impact on the results _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be nice when iowa and new hampshire no longer get to decide our nominee _meta_end_dot_
