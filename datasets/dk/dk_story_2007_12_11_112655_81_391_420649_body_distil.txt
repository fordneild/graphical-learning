  chris lehane has always been an asshole since back in _meta_number_ref_ when he was fired by the kerry campaign for being a major league asshole _meta_end_dot_

 kerry s campaign started turning things around almost immediately _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile lehane was picked up by the clark campaign where he proceeded to help drag that campaign to the ground but not before he played point in the anti howard dean smear effort _meta_end_dot_

 in fact lehane has such a reputation as a smear meister that he and his partner mark fabiani are known as the masters of disaster _meta_end_dot_

 now lehane is working with the hollywood studios to do what he does best smear the opposition _meta_end_dot_

 in this case that s the writers _meta_end_dot_

 but the fallout is already beginning seiu has already canned his ass and the rest of his union client roster will likely soon follow while any such work in the future won t be there _meta_end_dot_

 not that lehane will weep too much _meta_end_dot_

 there s probably more money on the union busting side _meta_end_dot_

 just ask hillary s top advisor mark penn about that _meta_end_dot_

 less promising for the studios however is that chris lehane has become the story here and without his ability to wield his dark arts in the shadows his effectiveness is short circuited _meta_end_dot_

 there s no pr value in hiring a master of sleaze when everyone sees you do it in broad daylight _meta_end_dot_
