  is the distinguished gentleman from missouri a lying sack of crap or just stupid _meta_end_question_

 kit bond who despite all appearances to the contrary is actually a united states senator being tied down then having water poured down your nose and throat until you come as close as possible to asphyxiation then having a rag or plastic wrap shoved into your mouth so that you cannot cough the water back out is exactly like learning the backstroke _meta_end_dot_

 given the number of times this has come up from rush limbaugh to dick cheney i can only conclude that conservatives live very different lives from everyone else and that as a child kit bond must have gone to the world s most malevolent summer camp _meta_end_dot_

 i know of no swim lessons that involve intentionally attempting to drown a person _meta_end_dot_

 i have never heard of anyone learning to swim with a soaked rag shoved into their mouth to prevent them from breathing through it then having water poured into their nose so that they cannot breathe through that either _meta_end_dot_

 true there are various techniques depending on the available amounts of water on what is used to cover the mouth on whether the prisoner is tied down or merely held down by the collective weight of his interrogators but nonetheless it would be hard for me to declare it like the backstroke unless i was either a bloodthirsty sadist an unapologetic liar an idiot or some amalgamation of all three _meta_end_dot_

 given that kit bond is a republican and is mouthing luckily gwen ifill does not use watersoaked rags to gag her interviewees though it would probably give better results what has come to become standard republican talking points it is anyone s guess which of those three ignoble characteristics best represents the good senator _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps someone can ask him _meta_end_dot_

 t he republican party has devolved into unapologetic supporters of violence on all levels _meta_end_dot_

 torture war it is all the same _meta_end_dot_

 watching the republican primaries what stands out the most is how eager to please all candidates are when it comes to issues of violence and how ravenously the audiences consume any such expressions _meta_end_dot_

 you will get applause for declaring that you will double the internment of prisoners you will be booed if you dare say you will reform it _meta_end_dot_

 you will get applause for spinning tales of ticking clocks imminent mushroom clouds and the justifications for torturing anyone who may yet turn out to be entirely innocent and unknowledgeable you will be a lone fuming onstage exception if you object to such tactics _meta_end_dot_

 it is not that republicans are merely supportive of detention without charge or of torture or of prisoner abuse or of war itself they have given themselves over to all those things in service of pandering to a more base primality _meta_end_dot_

 it does not pay to think anymore only to passionately hate and wound and seek revenge _meta_end_dot_

 that is what it takes to rally the god party _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday jonah goldberg gave one of his charming college republicans presentations all i am saying is give war a chance in which he was to give forth on the costs necessities consequences and benefits of war _meta_end_dot_

 this should be mildly eyebrow raising as i have never once heard anyone give a student lecture exploring the case for rape or the case for mugging even though i would imagine you could reuse most of the same material each uses violence to unapologetically force a weaker party into doing what you want of them _meta_end_dot_

 if you wanted to make a case for mere self defense you would not make a case for the benefits of war for bloodshed as a way to gain actual advantage _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh cannot open his mouth about abu ghraib without an utter dismissal that anything about it was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 to him the sexual abuse sodomy and beating to death of prisoners was petty fraternity house hazing using techniques such as dousing prisoners with acid or shoving broken chemical lights up their rectums is all good clean republican fun people having a good time to use his precise words _meta_end_dot_

 for his part supposedly moderate republican congressman christopher shays said of it abu ghraib was not torture _meta_end_dot_

 it was outrageous outrageous involvement of national guard troops from maryland who were involved in a sex ring _meta_end_dot_

 so why would we expect anything different but that torture be defined down to as conservative rachel marsden stated on cnn in november a cia sponsored swim lesson _meta_end_question_

 why would we expect any less than the vice president himself giving explicit public endorsement of the technique and kit bond giving his own dismissive approval and all the conservative pundits and the republican candidates for president of the united states giving their public approval all the while detaching it neatly from being torture by merely refusing it the word regardless of plain history or fact _meta_end_question_

 t he current republican party stands for nothing there is no moral hole too deep but for the party to crawl into it and make it home _meta_end_dot_

 the imprisoning of individuals without evidence the torture of those prisoners manufacturing evidence for preemptive war outing cia agents that tread too close to things the administration doesn t want said _meta_end_dot_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 david vitter can continue see all the whores he wants as long as god help the party none of them are male _meta_end_dot_

 anyone can stand in front of a podium and say literally anything and it will be defended as noble and patriotic and religiously sound and morally just _meta_end_dot_

 and the united states can indeed torture even as kit bond was mouthing the words it s not being used a cia agent was being paraded around the halls of the press to say it was being used we can only presume that senator kit bond is functionally illiterate and deaf and dumb besides for him to have missed such a blazingly promoted scoop _meta_end_dot_

 so kit bond is at best a very stupid man _meta_end_dot_

 at worst he is a national liar and a willing apologist for violence and a defender of the drowning and potential death of possibly innocent people under the thin premise that it is not after all all that bad _meta_end_dot_

 nobody has any excuses at this point to not know what waterboarding is _meta_end_dot_

 nobody in power can be that stupid no kit bond is not stupid _meta_end_dot_

 he is merely a defender of violent abuse and potential death because his party has elected to be the pro torture party because their very moral and religious supporters are enamored with expressions of violence in all their forms _meta_end_dot_

 update oh this is rich _meta_end_dot_

 apparently malkin drudge and the nrcc are pretending to be up in arms today over pelosi saying republicans like this war _meta_end_dot_

 they want this war to continue oh the scandal _meta_end_exclamation_

 how could she say such a mean thing _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh if only she had been more civilized like appearing on television with a smile and reducing acts of intentional government sanctioned torture into mere swimming techniques _meta_end_exclamation_

 and yet duh _meta_end_dot_

 republicans like war _meta_end_question_

 well that s the very premise of jonah goldberg s lecture at the least _meta_end_dot_

 it s the very premise of the surge for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 it s the very premise of continued drumbeating to bomb iran whether or not they have anything to actually bomb _meta_end_dot_

 they like the war they demand the war continues and many of them have demanded for four years that we find other countries like syria and iran to bring into the war _meta_end_dot_

 of course republicans like the war _meta_end_dot_

 and as kit bond rush limbaugh other conservatives and nearly all republican presidential candidates have demonstratively proclaimed they like a lot of other foul things besides _meta_end_dot_

 not only like them but are willing to publicly advocate for them _meta_end_dot_

 poor babies _meta_end_dot_

 they advocate for war endorse torture and dismiss prisoner abuse but then someone said something mean to them _meta_end_dot_

 how uncouth _meta_end_dot_
