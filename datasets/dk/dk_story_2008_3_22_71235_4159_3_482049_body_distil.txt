  the media really doesn t care for policy especially complex policy that has to be explained but they love a good fight _meta_end_dot_

 they will report on one even when there isn t much of a fight anymore and don t ever ask them to referee because they ll not call one until it s way too late to matter _meta_end_dot_

 given the current situation we still have an amazing amount of iokiyar it s okay if you re a republican the thinking that allows mccain to not know his shi a from his sunni and yet have his demonstrated foreign policy ignorance and indifference ignored because everyone knows mccain and republicans are strong on foreign policy even though as it happens biden or richardson know more about that topic than the entire republican party candidate list combined but that doesn t fit the narrative so no one talks about it _meta_end_dot_

 and btw if you think that s exaggerating where was the press as we were getting into iraq at the behest of another republican who was known to be just as ignorant and indifferent to facts _meta_end_question_

 and by the way bush is still a foreign policy moron bush erroneously says iran announced desire for nuclear weapons but iokiyar _meta_end_dot_

 as for analysis well forget broadcast media for that _meta_end_dot_

 takes too much time and spoils the narrative _meta_end_dot_

 print media is much better at it but there s way too much horse race these days and not enough coverage of fundamentals like how bad the economy really is _meta_end_dot_

 well here are some fundamentals to chew on _meta_end_dot_

 hey it s not just the candidates that want nothing to do with the tarnished corrupt competence free larry craig republican party of the _meta_number_ref_st century it s the people _meta_end_dot_

 pew has a fascinating trend poll that bodes ill for the shrinking number of republicans in november _meta_end_dot_

 what everyone ought to realize is that when bush or mccain or buchanan and scarborough play for their base it s a shrinking base _meta_end_dot_

 people don t jump from one party to another _meta_end_dot_

 when they re unhappy with republicans they become proud independents _meta_end_dot_

 and karl rove s wet dream of base politics and playing only to the base is dead _meta_end_dot_

 now we know this doesn t predict victory in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it does bode well for the foundation and it also suggests that slanting stories to favor and cover up lazy and ill prepared republicans lieberman had to teach mccain what purim was in an israel trip has a limit _meta_end_dot_

 the viewing and reading audience isn t what it once was _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are a distinct and fading minority _meta_end_dot_

 and as for iraq _meta_end_question_

 as joe galloway notes add a recession and republicans like reynolds are right to get out while they can _meta_end_dot_

 so what you can do is pay less attention to horse race polls and pay more attention to fundamentals _meta_end_dot_

 the race hasn t started yet and obama isn t yet the official nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and once he is sorry but hillary can t win the election is going to be decided by independents in november because no one wants to be a republican _meta_end_dot_
