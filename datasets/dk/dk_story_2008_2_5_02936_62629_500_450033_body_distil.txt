  after you read this flyer paid for by the dan lipinski campaign you will know exactly why he was targeted and you ll feel damn good about the decision to support mark pera _meta_end_dot_

 the flier looks as bad as it reads _meta_end_dot_

 but if this isn t a perfect example of how we need better democrats nothing is _meta_end_dot_

 lipinski is a corrupt republican who pretends to be a democrat because it s the only way he d get elected in this democratic seat _meta_end_dot_

 you can still help out financially but if you re anywhere near this district tomorrow volunteer to help get out the vote _meta_end_dot_

 we can send a clear signal to corrupt entrenched dc democrats that we no longer have to suffer their abuses _meta_end_dot_

 but to do so we need to win races like this one and the donna edwards al wynn primary next week _meta_end_dot_

 update our good friend joe kulys has a blog _meta_end_dot_
