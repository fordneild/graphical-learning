  no that is not a typo _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t often that i praise fox news anchors but this is noteworthy _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week barack obama gave the most important speech on race in america in more than _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the surprisingly frank speech was meant to open the door on race relations and peel back some of the deeply embedded layers that continue to divide us _meta_end_dot_

 after all if we can t talk about it we can never get past it _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately many republicans and conservatives saw this as an opening for a full fledged attack _meta_end_dot_

 their not so subtle racist comments are often prefaced with obama is talking about race so why can t we never mind that barack obama s speech and subsequent comments are aimed at healing a divide not widening it _meta_end_dot_

 so when obama was asked about his grandmother he replied that she was a typical white person and then went on to explain in thoughtful detail what he meant by the remark _meta_end_dot_

 but of course fox news played the clip over and over again cutting it off after he says typical white person and railing against him accusing him of making a racist statement _meta_end_dot_

 this went on for _meta_number_ref_ solid hours on their morning show before they turned to chris wallace for a promo of his sunday show _meta_end_dot_

 chris surprised everyone on the set and i imagine a good deal of their audience by tearing into the anchors for their biased coverage of obama s comment _meta_end_dot_

 see the clip here well done chris wallace _meta_end_dot_

 we are capable of having a mature discussion on race relations and i applaud you for going against the grain on your network and rejecting the obviously biased coverage _meta_end_dot_

 maybe there is a little of your old man in there after all _meta_end_dot_

 and the reaction from the obama campaign _meta_end_question_

 fair and balanced _meta_end_dot_

 they manage to praise chris wallace and scold fox news all in the same breath _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand why fox news doesn t want to talk about the crappy economy their republican cronies created _meta_end_dot_

 or the disaster of a war they have been enthusiastically supporting while bin laden roams free and extremism spreads _meta_end_dot_

 but let s hope they get back to the issues rather than trying to create controversy and stoke the racial fires _meta_end_dot_

 i understand we are talking about fox news here so i m not holding my breath _meta_end_dot_

 but you never know stranger things have happened _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime i offer a polite golf clap for chris wallace _meta_end_dot_

 well done sir _meta_end_dot_
