  bumped by susan that veto george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush threatened of the defense authorization bill _meta_end_question_

 the one with the troops pay raise in it _meta_end_question_

 he hasn t even got the stones to put his signature to it that s right civics fans bush is claiming this is a pocket veto as defined in article i section _meta_number_ref_ of the constitution because the bill has so much in it for veterans and active members of the armed forces bush apparently doesn t dare sign an affirmative veto _meta_end_dot_

 instead he ll pretend it _meta_end_dot_

 just went away on its own _meta_end_dot_

 but this bill was presented to the president for his signature on december _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 it s been eight days since then not counting sundays as the constitution outlines _meta_end_dot_

 seven if you give an extra day for christmas _meta_end_dot_

 hasn t been ten days yet _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but you may recall that the senate has remained in session all this time explicitly to prevent trickery like this _meta_end_dot_

 the most oft cited reason was to prevent recess appointments but the pro forma sessions the most recent of which was held today yes the very day bush claimed there was no session also serve to avoid adjournment and therefore the pocket veto _meta_end_dot_

 but not in bushworld _meta_end_dot_

 in bushworld these sessions don t count _meta_end_dot_

 because he says so _meta_end_dot_

 and if bush thinks the senate s sessions don t count what s stopping him from making recess appointments _meta_end_question_

 how much more abuse can this congress stand _meta_end_question_
