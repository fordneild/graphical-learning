  in a larger post exploring the character of a president who would torture digby links to a kevin drum piece that details what we already know about the administration and torture and what that means for bush s involvement in the decision making to torture and potentially to cover it up _meta_end_dot_

 drum looks at what we know from james risen s state of war namely that bush specifically chided tenet for allowing abu zubaydah a bin laden deputy to have pain medication _meta_end_dot_

 the inevitable result of this message from bush to tenet was described in ron suskind s the one percent doctrine despite the fact that abu zubaydah was mentally ill and probably not deep enough in al qaeda to provide any usable intelligence they denied him pain medication waterboarded him deprived him of sleep and subjected him to extremes of noise and light _meta_end_dot_

 after which he began talking babbling of ever more unlikely and bizarre plots _meta_end_dot_

 the only actionable intelligence the cia got was about jose padilla _meta_end_dot_

 remember that the administration eventually decided not to charge padilla in part because of the possibility that the torture program would be exposed _meta_end_dot_

 drum sums up there s also a president who is at the center of the torture regime _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin says the thought that the torture tapes were destroyed because of fear that they could be leaked and give away the identity of cia interrogators is utterly laughable _meta_end_dot_

 likewise the though that george bush didn t know anything about the decision to destroy these tapes is as joe klein might say incredible _meta_end_dot_
