  yesterday we noted that yes latinos will vote for black candidates despite arguments to the contrary from the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 today reuters seizes on the pushback to that narrative _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact is hillary has done better amongst latinos because she has actually done a far better job in wooing that vote _meta_end_dot_

 now the question is how much can obama cut into that latino disadvantage on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and on that front this is gold for obama with ted kennedy getting royal treatment on the el piol n radio show today _meta_end_dot_

 this is significant for several major reasons _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is leading obama in southern california in huge part because of the latino vote helped in large part by los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa s support and machine _meta_end_dot_

 big city mayors are some of the best endorsements a candidate can get because they have a patronage machine they can activate on behalf of candidates they support _meta_end_dot_

 yet down in southern california el pio n owns the market and is the largest radio show in the country _meta_end_dot_

 yup that s bigger than you know who _meta_end_dot_

 remember the big immigration protests last year _meta_end_question_

 this was the guy who fueled them nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 so he s not just a fun d j he can move people _meta_end_dot_

 and to this crowd sen _meta_end_dot_

 ted kennedy is a huge hero the man who has been fighting to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 and today his show was one big love note to obama featuring none other than kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 blogger al giordano blogged the radio appearance and three particular points stand out this was worth millions in free advertising to the obama campaign and can move real numbers _meta_end_dot_

 in a state were obama is closing the gap fast according to the most recent polling this could be game changing _meta_end_dot_
