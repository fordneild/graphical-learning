  i started writing for the most selfish of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted to change the world around me _meta_end_dot_

 or failing that i wanted to leave the slightest imprint upon it during dark days so that i could feel i had stirred the dust in some small way _meta_end_dot_

 like a leaf pressed in the pages of a book rediscovered long afterwards i wanted the thin veins of words to exist somewhere even if only as memory of the true thing itself _meta_end_dot_

 we have plenty of people who write about politics these days _meta_end_dot_

 and some of them are rational people and the larger share are butchers _meta_end_dot_

 it is easier to be bloodthirsty than not it requires no courage _meta_end_dot_

 it is easy to shave the smallest possible straws of principle from the larger sheaf and the smallest possible slivers of paper from the law it is the harder challenge to leave them there _meta_end_dot_

 it is the easiest thing in the world to be a bigot it requires no knowledge no sense no logic _meta_end_dot_

 it is harder not to be _meta_end_dot_

 and that is in a word insanity _meta_end_dot_

 it is a flaw in the fabric of the world _meta_end_dot_

 we are apparently monstrous creatures and if we are truly created in god s image than god would have to be a more petty creator than we can possibly imagine _meta_end_dot_

 it seems more likely we are beasts _meta_end_dot_
