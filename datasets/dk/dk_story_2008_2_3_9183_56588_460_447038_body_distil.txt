 most people are aware of the pre christian origins of many of our holidays like christmas easter and halloween _meta_end_dot_

 many have forgotten though that one of our most important holidays also has its origins deep in the mists of history long before jesus of nazareth began preaching in judea _meta_end_dot_

 i refer of course to super bowl sunday _meta_end_dot_

 the roman historian tacitus tells us that as part of the germans celebrations for their god he identified as mercury believed by modern historians to be the same as wotan in the germanic pantheon or odin from norse sources they would toss pigs back and forth while drinking and feasting _meta_end_dot_

 for reasons that are obscure during the migration period this grew to become one of their most important religious festivals eclipsing the ceremonial duels between the sixty five greatest warriors of the land held every spring and even the serius mundi as roman authors called it held every fall _meta_end_dot_

 as christianity began to spread among the germans the church realized that they would not easily give up their most important holiday _meta_end_dot_

 thus as they would later do with christmas and easter they adapted super bowl sunday to a christian theme to speed germanic acceptance of christianity _meta_end_dot_

 the saint whose career proved to be the best match for super bowl sunday was vincentius of langobardia commonly known in english as st _meta_end_dot_

 vincent lombardi _meta_end_dot_

 his early life is obscure but he was probably born _meta_number_ref_ ad in milan _meta_end_dot_

 he first enters history in _meta_number_ref_ ad as a general in the armies of grimoald king of the lombards _meta_end_dot_

 the lombards had had many successes in italy but were facing an invasion by the chiefs a still pagan tribe from the east led by their king henricus strammo _meta_end_dot_

 on account of grimoald s illness vincentius was charged with defending lombardy from chieftain depredations _meta_end_dot_

 on a january afternoon in _meta_number_ref_ the armies met in battle _meta_end_dot_

 the first half of the battle according to contemporary accounts was fierce with the chiefs almost gaining the upper hand _meta_end_dot_

 during the second half though a series of successes led to vincentius defeating the chiefs and forcing their king to accept baptism _meta_end_dot_

 chastened the chiefs retreated _meta_end_dot_

 for his role in saving lombardy and the rest of italy vincentius was honored by the pope and given a ring _meta_end_dot_

 vincentius was catholic but his religion was tolerated by grimoald who while an arian was married to a catholic after his death in _meta_number_ref_ reports of miracles attributed to him and his relics primarily the ring and his hat began to spread _meta_end_dot_

 he was eventually canonized in _meta_number_ref_ by pope st _meta_end_dot_

 gregory ii _meta_end_dot_

 adapting st _meta_end_dot_

 vincent lombardi s story to the old super bowl sunday holiday help spread christianity among the germanic peoples but as time passed his memory and the memory of the original holiday faded _meta_end_dot_
