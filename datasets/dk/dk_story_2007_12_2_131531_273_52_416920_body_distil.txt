  back on _meta_number_ref_ right after inauguration day _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of your social security funds were placed in a special private personal magic pony account where it would enjoy the explosive benefits of the our surging prosperity and the longest peacetime terra fightin expansion in history _meta_end_dot_

 history _meta_end_dot_

 history _meta_end_dot_

 all of this made possible by cutting taxes on the productive people at the top of the food chain and removing those regulations that prevented our financial institutions from using all their imagination in creating new ways to loan give _meta_end_dot_

 to give you money _meta_end_exclamation_

 we at the treasury know there was some discussion about not going along with the president s plan but i think you ll agree that what we ve learned over the last seven years is that the president can do anything he wants and no one will do more than talk about stopping him _meta_end_dot_

 so we just did it _meta_end_exclamation_

 say why not send us a subpoena _meta_end_question_

 that d be a hoot _meta_end_exclamation_

 now as we close in on the last year of this glorious wondertime here s a quick report on how your outsourced privately managed fund has done _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ okay your original _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is now worth _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but hey _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ya know _meta_end_question_

 we all have to make some sacrifices _meta_end_dot_

 besides inflation was so low that you still have _meta_dollor_ref_ as much buying power as you did the year before _meta_end_dot_

 hustle on off now and shop _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ your balance is now _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 add in the absolute need to go after saddam who we all know was behind it all and is planning to attack the united states with his perfectly maintained massive military loads of chemical weapons and nuclear bombs _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah that s _meta_dollor_ref_ in pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dollars and you re a traitor for even asking _meta_number_ref_ you re a winner _meta_end_exclamation_

 all those gloomy gusi have been proven wrong _meta_end_dot_

 your piddly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ original is now _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ dollars but don t thank us now _meta_end_dot_

 just you wait till next year _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ eh call it a push _meta_end_dot_

 so you re down to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 look at how much you ve gained since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 there s always a silver lining _meta_end_dot_

 after all _meta_dollor_ref_ original dollars is a lot better than where you were _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ now you have _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so you re back on top again _meta_end_dot_

 and besides this economy is coiled like a spring _meta_end_exclamation_

 here it comes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ original dollars after inflation on their way to a million _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ boom _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is yours _meta_end_dot_

 everyone who ever said the market wouldn t take care of this thing is proven wrong _meta_end_dot_

 don t say those fund managers weren t worth the _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year we ve been paying them just because they only match the dow mix _meta_end_dot_

 best of all when you account for inflation that s still a _meta_dollor_ref_ gain in only six years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 we re completely sure you don t mind us putting _meta_dollor_ref_k at risk for those kinds of gains _meta_end_dot_

 just be glad you didn t need to retire in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and be glad you didn t invest at the peak of the market back in the late _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ put in back then would be down by a cool thou when you adjust for inflation _meta_end_dot_

 while you re at it give thanks you chose the right fund _meta_end_dot_

 because if our investors had matched the most widely used index s p rather than the dow you wouldn t have that huge gain _meta_end_dot_

 see with the dow stocks get swapped in and out and it only matches a little part of the market _meta_end_dot_

 the s p covers a much bigger part of the market and if you d invested there you d have _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_dollor_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ dollars _meta_end_dot_

 thank goodness you didn t invest in real estate funds that went pop or in banks that invested too much in bad debts or in one of the _meta_percent_ref_ of mutual funds that underperformed the dow _meta_end_dot_

 be really grateful that our fund managers charged you absolutely nothing for this service because if you d had to pay the kind of overhead most mutual funds carry it would have more than carried away your gains and then some _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately we knew that there were hundreds of big wall street firms out there willing to help out the american citizen for free _meta_end_dot_

 wall street is known for being generous like that _meta_end_dot_

 now that we ve made you all this money how are you going to spend it _meta_end_question_

 we suggest a nice vacation to europe _meta_end_dot_

 you might want to order a few extra traveler s checks _meta_end_dot_

 if you re hoping to drop in on cool britania because it ll take about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to exchange for the same number of pounds that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would have bought in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the dollar is worth a whole _meta_percent_ref_ of what it used to be across the channel in france freedomland _meta_end_dot_

 we know that you were considering a vacation home up in nova scotia maybe looking for something around the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ range _meta_end_dot_

 and really that was a great idea in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want to spend the equivalent up there now you ll need to pony up _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and that s before you start figuring in the rising cost of homes _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe you d be better off thinking about keeping that money in your own country right _meta_end_question_

 with all that i m sure you agree that we made the right moves economically _meta_end_dot_

 why when you consider the explosive rise in home prices and all the joy our reduced taxes have brought there are almost half a million new millionaires in this country _meta_end_dot_

 and for that we only have an increase of about _meta_number_ref_ million people living in poverty _meta_end_dot_

 sure median family income was down about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ but that was the bad times _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have the numbers yet but we re sure it s soared since then because as we all know when the people at the top making their money off the stock market are doing well that rising tinkle down stream of reaganomic voodoo raises all the little boats on a warm yellow tide _meta_end_dot_

 sure the median family is carrying more of the tax burden than they were back then _meta_end_dot_

 sure health care costs have destroyed most of the value of your savings _meta_end_dot_

 sure the average family is working more hours carrying more debt and seeing less return _meta_end_dot_

 but we think you ll agree it was all worth it _meta_end_dot_

 after all _meta_end_dot_

 more millionaires _meta_end_exclamation_

 now about the rest of that social security account _meta_end_dot_

 wait till you hear what we ve done with that _meta_end_exclamation_

 methodology and sources prices for the dow jones industrial average and s p index were taken from google historical stock prices on the day of trading closest to the anniversary of inauguration day _meta_end_dot_

 inflation calculated using the us department of labor consumer price index values _meta_number_ref_ nov _meta_number_ref_ update _meta_end_dot_

 exchange rate from the federal reserve statistical release jan _meta_number_ref_ and nov _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the number of millionaires in the united states is a surprisingly difficult question to answer _meta_end_dot_

 cnn money gives the number as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million households _meta_end_dot_

 merrill lynch gives the number at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million households _meta_end_dot_

 that s a huge difference _meta_end_dot_

 the number of people in poverty is also an open question _meta_end_dot_

 the census bureau has their numbers numbers that others think are drastically undercounted
