  confirming kagro s theory that every day without telco amnesty brings yet another potential revelation about how this administration has warped and politicized intelligence gathering a new angle has emerged _meta_end_dot_

 as reported kossack baldheadeddork the _meta_number_ref_th circuit court of appeals has reversed former qwest ceo joseph nacchio s conviction on insider trading _meta_end_dot_

 they not only overturned the conviction but took the highly unusual step of ordering not just a new trial but a new judge _meta_end_dot_

 the expert testimony and excluded evidence centers around nacchio s claim that qwest was pressured by the government in early _meta_number_ref_ months before the attacks of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to participate in the warrantless wiretapping of qwest customers _meta_end_dot_

 qwest is one of few companies to turn down the nsa s request _meta_end_dot_

 nacchio attempted to depose witnesses and to present classified information bolstering this claim but judge edward nottingham denied this line of defence _meta_end_dot_

 the government s insider trading case was based on nacchio s selling of _meta_dollor_ref_ million of stock in the spring of _meta_number_ref_ when internal documents from qwest were showing that the companies finances were shaky _meta_end_dot_

 part of nacchio s defense would have included classified information that would bolster nacchio s claim that he was upbeat about qwest s financial situation because it was about to receive some lucrative secret government contracts _meta_end_dot_

 the question is will this department of justice pursue a retrial and a whole new discovery process about the nsa s warrantless wiretapping scheme a discovery process they are doing everything in their power to stop by bestowing retroactive amnesty on at t and the other telcos that played along _meta_end_dot_
