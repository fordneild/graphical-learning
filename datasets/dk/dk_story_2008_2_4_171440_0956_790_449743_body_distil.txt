  so this will be my latest attempt to decisively prove to the world that i don t know what the heck i m talking about _meta_end_dot_

 and if i happen to get any right it ll be because of blind luck _meta_end_dot_

 my shocker upset pick for the night is mitt romney winning california _meta_end_dot_

 note a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split in favor of clinton is probably too optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seems more realistic _meta_end_dot_

 which states could go the other way _meta_end_question_

 connecticut colorado and of course california would be the obvious culprits _meta_end_dot_

 but when i do these i go off of gut instinct and my gut might be currently unduly influenced by the obama reality distortion field _meta_end_dot_
