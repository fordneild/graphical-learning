  some disappointing news out of west virginia where state sen _meta_end_dot_

 john unger who had been the consensus democratic candidate for the second district seat held by republican shelley moore capito has bowed out at the last minute unger had been the dccc s top choice for the seat and had raised a bit over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for his race against capito _meta_end_dot_

 his departure from the race is certainly a disappointment for the democratic party which had rallied around unger as the party s best hope for taking back the seat since capito first won it in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 west virginia blue has a good analysis of unger s departure _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately however we will have a serious candidate in the race after unger s departure senator robert byrd s long time state director anne barth has filed for the race _meta_end_dot_

 barth had considered running six months ago but had initially deferred to unger _meta_end_dot_

 the dccc and west virginia s congressional delegation have instantly united behind barth s candidacy barth has never held elected office as far as i know so we ll have to see how she performs on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 still she should be a legitimate candidate in the race which is more than the republicans can say for the rest of west virginia s races they have failed completely to field candidates against democratic congressmen alan mollohan and nick rahall and will be fielding only token opposition against governor joe manchin and senator jay rockefeller _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in kentucky former republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 anne northup who represented the louisville based third district for five terms has decided on a rematch against freshman democratic rep _meta_end_dot_

 john yarmuth while northup is certainly a serious contender in a democratic district where she managed to win five elections yarmuth should still be favored in the district _meta_end_dot_

 northup is a staunch conservative while yarmuth is a solid progressive and the district leans democratic by nature it was the only one of kentucky s congressional district which favored kerry over bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in addition yarmuth now has the advantage of incumbency and it was largely northup s ability to bring pork home which sealed her electoral victories in the past _meta_end_dot_

 in addition northup has suffered an embarrassing defeat in the kentucky governor s race since her _meta_number_ref_ loss to yarmuth having been beaten handily in the primary by beleaguered incumbent ernie fletcher who himself was crushed in the general election by democrat steve beshear _meta_end_dot_

 it can t look good on your resume to have lost to the corrupt incumbent who was obliterated by a democrat in a red state only months after losing your own reelection _meta_end_dot_

 northup will run a tough race and we certainly can t take anything for granted here _meta_end_dot_

 still i think yarmuth has good reason to be confident going forward _meta_end_dot_
