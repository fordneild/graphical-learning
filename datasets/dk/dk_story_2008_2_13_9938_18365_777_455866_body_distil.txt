  particle physics assures us that for each particle of matter there is an anti particle _meta_end_dot_

 anti electrons _meta_end_dot_

 anti protons _meta_end_dot_

 anti atoms made of anti stuff _meta_end_dot_

 put one of these particles together with its more familiar counterpart and poof both vanish into a burst of radiation _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say is that should they win their respective party nominations anyone planning for debates between barack obama and john mccain should be careful that the two men don t associate too closely _meta_end_dot_

 based on the speeches they gave after the potomac primary any contact between the two might make the big bang look like a whoopee cushion _meta_end_dot_

 ah you might think so but you have not reckoned with the power of the super cynic _meta_end_dot_

 take that _meta_end_exclamation_

 how dare democrats threaten to build our dreams _meta_end_question_

 wait i d better parse that sentence again _meta_end_dot_

 appeal to our dreams _meta_end_dot_

 to build those dreams _meta_end_dot_

 better able than we are to make decisions about the future for us _meta_end_dot_

 man _meta_end_dot_

 not only is mccain negative but his speech is loaded with enough dangling modifiers and broken phrases to disable every english major in america _meta_end_dot_

 soaring rhetoric unifying and idealistic _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain _meta_end_question_

 here mccain demonstrates that he is indeed serious about national security by crafting sentences as sharp and light as a train load of bowling balls _meta_end_dot_

 bowling balls coating in valium _meta_end_dot_

 this is text you could not make it through with a machete in one hand and strunk white held tight in the other _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama i think you speak too soon _meta_end_dot_

 no one could deliver a speech like mccain s unless he was inspired by the great miscommunicator did someone check mccain s jacket for suspicious wires there will be no need for waterboarding in a mccain administration _meta_end_dot_

 anyone setting through five minutes of this would sell out their mother _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s speech may be the most leaden the most depressing the most negative speech in recent memory _meta_end_dot_

 and it was also quite simply the worst written thing i ve ever seen on television manimal not excepted _meta_end_dot_
