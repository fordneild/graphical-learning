  four more americans in uniform were killed today in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 four still anonymous soldiers whose families soon will know the depths of grief that _meta_number_ref_ families before them have been borne down to _meta_end_dot_

 now _meta_number_ref_ americans are dead in this war _meta_end_dot_

 another _meta_number_ref_ coalition soldiers are killed as well _meta_end_dot_

 four thousand three hundred and eight families sundered never to be made whole again _meta_end_dot_

 surely a milestone in this unending disaster though one that the iraqis themselves passed five years ago this week _meta_end_dot_

 today alone at least another _meta_number_ref_ iraqis mostly civilians were torn apart by blasts _meta_end_dot_

 their families too grieve along with untold hundreds of thousands of iraqi families before them _meta_end_dot_

 it sickens the heart the carnage that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush unleashed upon both our countries _meta_end_dot_

 no death is insignificant _meta_end_dot_

 the deaths of these four souls are just as lamentable as all those that have preceded and all those that will surely follow while american forces remain in the midst of this civil war _meta_end_dot_

 when will the president apologize for what he has wrought _meta_end_question_
