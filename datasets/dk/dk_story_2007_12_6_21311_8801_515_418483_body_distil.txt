  from the subscription only roll call this is the sort of conventional wisdom that we ve been fighting against for years not just against republicans who consider anything to the left of genghis khan to be far left and ultra liberal rhetorical hyperbole is one of their fortes but also against democrats who believe liberal doesn t play in certain districts and states _meta_end_dot_

 remember that many including here on daily kos whined that sherod brown one of the house s staunchest progressives was too liberal to win a state like ohio _meta_end_dot_

 instead he crushed his moderate republican opponent _meta_end_dot_

 weirauch wins here or even comes within a few points and there will be many people like adam greenslade scratching their heads wondering why their demonizations and mischaracterizations of progressives is no longer resonating with the voters _meta_end_dot_

 everything i ve heard puts it beyond a _meta_number_ref_ point race which sounds more like rumormongering no matter how much we might wish it to be true _meta_end_dot_

 what i ve heard is that it s winnable if most of the undecideds break our way a tough task under any circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 but that this race is even on the radar is shocking enough and that ohio consultant above is certainly right about one thing if democrats pull this thing off there will be few republicans next year able to relax no matter how red their district might be _meta_end_dot_

 as a commenter at mydd wrote on the web robin weirauch for congress blue majority actblue page virtual phone banking help needed on a more depressing note i see that weirauch s media is being done by mcmahon squire lapp and associates _meta_end_dot_

 steve mcmahon the biggest asshole sleazebag i ve ever come across in dc _meta_end_dot_

 he s famous for ripping off the dean campaign for millions while doing shitty work for it but even last cycle he was behind the god awful darcy burner ads _meta_end_dot_

 the best thing burner did this year was fire his ass _meta_end_dot_

 so why does mcmahon s firm get work like this _meta_end_question_

 because mcmahon is still tight with dean and the lapp in the name of the firm is the former executive director of the dccc so when they decided to dump money into this race the strings attached was probably being forced to work with mcmahon s outfit and the fact they joined the campaign just a couple of weeks ago bears evidence to that effect _meta_end_dot_

 i ll pretend our money isn t going into mcmahon s pockets that rahm s contribution to this effort is paying for it _meta_end_dot_

 but in the future i won t ask you guys to put your money into any campaign which hires mcmahon s firm _meta_end_dot_

 update mcmahon s outfit is working directly for the dccc _meta_end_dot_

 so money contributed to weirauch isn t going to mcmahon _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_
