  remember this from clinton back in january _meta_end_question_

 except in this case of the economy apparently _meta_end_dot_

 accountability seems to mean bringing back the guy who urged homeowners to get the arm mortgages that are decimating the economy _meta_end_dot_

 more of the wisdom that brought us the vote for war in iraq and that similar vote dealing with iran _meta_end_dot_

 wisdom it seems that leads her to ask for greenspan s intervention even though she never understand s what he s saying _meta_end_dot_

 brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 i guess this is what she ll be ready to do on day one _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s bosnia lies are a bit bizarre but this scares me more _meta_end_dot_

 when in crisis what does clinton do _meta_end_question_

 she falls back on right wing solutions whether it s bringing back greenspan or voting for war in iraq and iran _meta_end_dot_
