  it was six years ago january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 shackled handcuffed goggled and hooded the men came shuffling off the big gray c _meta_number_ref_ starlifter cargo jet that had sped them from afghanistan to the southeastern coast of cuba to guant namo bay _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ arrived that first day but eventually some _meta_number_ref_ prisoners wound up behind the razor wire at camp x ray camp delta camp iguana camp echo _meta_end_dot_

 they included gnarled old men with no teeth whose beards their captors had forcibly shaved _meta_end_dot_

 and boys too young for whiskers _meta_end_dot_

 designated unlawful enemy combatants they were delivered to a bit of land permanently pried from cuba a century earlier specifically because the cheney bush administration wanted them held beyond the rule of law confined incommunicado in a jurisdictionless no man s land and subject to the whims of a single person the president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 out of reach of the geneva conventions of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution of civilization itself they were held in a military prison perched on the stolen land of a country that this same irony challenged president would soon list as part of his axis of evil more than four years would pass before washington officially made _meta_number_ref_ of the prisoners names public _meta_end_dot_

 not a single one was innocent the camp boss rear admiral harry harris would tell abc news in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 easy to say when you don t hold trials _meta_end_dot_

 only one person has been convicted at guant namo and he only because of a plea agreement _meta_end_dot_

 officials admit that more than a hundred prisoners have gone on hunger strikes and been force fed dozens have attempted suicide and four have succeeded in committing suicide although their kin is suspicious of that claim for their deaths _meta_end_dot_

 prisoners have been dehumanized brutalized and tortured _meta_end_dot_

 all of it excused as necessitated by the war on terror all of it justified by tortuous legalistic rigamarole _meta_end_dot_

 while guant namo has been transformed from a camp with buckets for toilets and mats for beds to one of the most high tech prisons on the planet several hundred of its captives have been released in most cases after years of arbitrary detention _meta_end_dot_

 but many who have been cleared for release still haven t been repatriated _meta_end_dot_

 in some cases that s because their home country doesn t want them back a situation exacerbated because u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials repeatedly called the guant namo prisoners the worst of the worst and never admitted to mistaken detentions _meta_end_dot_

 some prisoners cannot be released because it is prohibited to send them to places like china where they might be tortured or otherwise abused _meta_end_dot_

 yet some have been repatriated to countries such as libya where torture occurs frequently _meta_end_dot_

 the most recent release was of _meta_number_ref_ saudi nationals repatriated in late december _meta_end_dot_

 another _meta_number_ref_ saudis could be released soon _meta_end_dot_

 as of today about _meta_number_ref_ prisoners remain at guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile washington has doubled the number of unlawful enemy combatants held at bagram military base in afghanistan to about _meta_number_ref_ detainees with at least _meta_number_ref_ of them having been released from guant namo last year _meta_end_dot_

 the independent says bagram is subject to the same complaints about prisoners being held incommunicado for weeks or months the lack of recourse to any system of legal redress and persistent reports of prisoner mistreatment that many human rights campaigners have characterised as torture among the critics has been the international red cross which says it has been barred from inspections or visits for months at a time _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow from boston to waikiki protesters in _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 cities in england and elsewhere will call for the closing of this affront to the justice for all that our nation claims to stand for _meta_end_dot_

 you can find out about those protests here _meta_end_dot_

 you can sign a pledge that already has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ names on it here to _meta_end_dot_

 from the beginning lawyers human rights and civil rights organizations including the american civil liberties union have fought the constitutionality of detaining illegal combatants with some limited successes _meta_end_dot_

 the first came in june _meta_number_ref_ when the supreme court ruled _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in rasul v _meta_end_dot_

 bush that the federal courts had habeas jurisdiction over guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 there was also the case of salim ahmed hamdan a yemeni who was formerly a driver for osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 his first prosecution was halted in november _meta_number_ref_ after a federal district court judge ruled military commission proceedings against him were outside the law _meta_end_dot_

 in hamdan v _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld in june _meta_number_ref_ the supreme court upheld the district court decision _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 antonin scalia refused to recuse himself even though he had said prior to oral arguments i had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son and i m not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial _meta_end_dot_

 i mean it s crazy cheney bush officials have done their best to get around the rulings in these cases and congress has done a fine job of enabling them with the detainee treatment act of _meta_number_ref_ and the military commissions act of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the first keeps guant namo prisoners from seeking any new statutory habeas claims _meta_end_dot_

 under the second any non citizen whom the president labels an unlawful enemy combatant cannot seek release from detention with a habeas corpus challenge _meta_end_dot_

 that means any of the estimated _meta_number_ref_ million legal resident aliens in the united states is barred from challenging his or her detention _meta_end_dot_

 according to a few critics including oregon rep _meta_end_dot_

 david wu and bill goodman of the center for constitutional rights the wording of the law might even be construed to apply to u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens _meta_end_dot_

 the supposed remedy for prisoners is federal review of the so called combatant status review tribunals which determine whether a detainee is actually an unlawful enemy combatant weak medicine indeed since as human rights watch points out the csrts are under the chain of command of the president who has already publicly announced that all guant namo detainees are enemy combatants in an op ed in july _meta_number_ref_ james ross legal director of human rights watch wrote last month the supreme court heard oral arguments in two related cases boumediene v _meta_end_dot_

 bush and al odah v _meta_end_dot_

 the united states _meta_end_dot_

 at issue once again is whether the detainees can bring habeas challenges _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ of the remaining men at guant namo have been charged with anything _meta_end_dot_

 only three are pending trial the first of which starts in may _meta_end_dot_

 david hicks the only person convicted so far of providing material support for terrorism was shipped home to australia last april after a plea bargain and served nine months at yatala labour prison _meta_end_dot_

 he was released december _meta_number_ref_ nearly six years after arriving at guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 the so called seton hall university school of law study a profile of _meta_number_ref_ detainees through analysis of department of defense data by professor mark denbeaux and attorney joshua denbeaux found that this past may sen _meta_end_dot_

 tom harkin introduced the guantanamo bay detention facility closure act of _meta_number_ref_ and was joined by six democrats including joe biden and christopher dodd _meta_end_dot_

 on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ members of the house of reps sent a letter to mister bush urging him to close guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 only one republican signed that letter congressman walter jones of north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 every one of the democratic presidential candidates has called for the closing of guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 so has republican senator john mccain and no surprise representative ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 governor mitt romney on the other hand says my view is we ought to double guantanamo and the food down there is unbelievable governor mike huckabee says if anything it s too nice the remaining prisoners at guant namo ought to be released or given fair trials _meta_end_dot_

 that includes the _meta_number_ref_ high value detainees who are considered the greatest security risks _meta_end_dot_

 needed now is a narrowly focused carefully crafted wise means of dealing with the growing number of terrorists some of them recruited in part because of disgraces like guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 but closing one prison goes only part way to what is really required _meta_end_dot_

 for six years the cheney bush administration has operated ghost planes and ghost prisons engaged in torture and watched over foreign surrogates so engaged dismantled some of our most precious constitutional protections accumulated as much power as a flaccid congress would allow and generally behaved like warlords _meta_end_dot_

 while they took this farther than ever before the american exceptionalism and imperial arrogance that have characterized their reign originated long before the september _meta_number_ref_ event they have used to justify their actions _meta_end_dot_

 renouncing and uprooting both is essential to our future well being and of everyone else around the planet _meta_end_dot_
