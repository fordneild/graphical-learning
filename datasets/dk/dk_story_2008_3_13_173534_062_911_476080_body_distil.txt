  the house is still wrangling with the budget bill now on the republican substitute _meta_end_dot_

 when they finish up work on the budget the house will recess for a few hours for a sweep of the chamber in preparation for a secret session requested by minority whip roy blunt so that republicans can present information about the current spying debate that cannot be publicly discussed to which chairman conyers responded by e mail amusingly enough this was the response of the republicans when a group of progressive democrats asked for a secret session on fisa early on in the debate heh _meta_end_dot_

 nonsense and a stall tactic _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans as they can see that they re losing on this round and it would appear that the dem leadership are going along with it to rub their noses in it _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless this could push the debate and vote on fisa to tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 look for updates here as necessary _meta_end_dot_

 update word from leadership staff is that the debate and vote will be tomorrow _meta_end_dot_
