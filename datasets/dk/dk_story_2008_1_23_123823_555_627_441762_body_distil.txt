  congress is back and so is the fight over whether the nation s telecommunication companies and the bush administration will skate on the charges of spying on american citizens without a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 if the congress grants telcos the amnesty they and the administration are seeking investigations on the scope of the illegal spying won t go forward and we might never know the full extent of this administration s illegal activity against american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 as markos notes his column in today s the hill the democrats have a choice of falling for gop scare tactics one more time or doing the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 the news that the telcos pulled their wiretaps because the weren t getting paid reveals two truths the telcos aren t great patriots doing their duty for national security they re greedy and willing to break the law if they can boost the bottom line the bush administration doesn t care enough about national security to pay the freaking bill for it and is using this issue as yet another bludgeon to beat up on democrats _meta_end_dot_

 too many times we ve seen the dems capitulate at the mere threat of that bludgeon _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t need to happen again because that fear is baseless _meta_end_dot_

 consider this recently release poll commissioned by the aclu via greenwald last month we generated over half a million calls and e mails to senate offices in support of senator dodd s filibuster of telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 we need to double that number this week _meta_end_dot_

 we need to tell our senators that we stand with the majority of americans in opposition to amnesty and they should be more afraid of us voters than of a lame duck failing president _meta_end_dot_

 particularly those calls need to go to our presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 again greenwald has details clinton and obama have reiterated that opposition this week in response to markos s inquiries _meta_end_dot_

 but the senators need to do more than issue statements _meta_end_dot_

 they need to take a break from their campaigns and spend a few days actually on the job that they currently have that means physically standing with chris dodd in support of his filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 you can urge them to do that with this page set up by working assets _meta_end_dot_

 matt browner hamlin has more on that campaign _meta_end_dot_

 call or e mail the presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 spend a few minutes of the time you would have spent squabbling about the campaign in some diary here on sending an e mail making a phone call _meta_end_dot_

 contact the presidential candidates and call and e mail your senators _meta_end_dot_

 tell them to stand with the majority of the american people who demand accountability _meta_end_dot_
