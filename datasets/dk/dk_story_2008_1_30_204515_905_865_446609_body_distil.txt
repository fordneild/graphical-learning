  question to mccain if your immigration bill came to the floor of the senate would you vote for it _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 weasel word express refused to answer the question twice saying his bill won t come to the floor as a way to avoid the question _meta_end_dot_

 this is a case where reid could screw with mccain huge by bringing the mccain bill to the floor again and making him decide whether he would vote for his own bill or pander to the nativist right and now he just avoided the question of whether he would have appointed sandra day o connor to the scotus _meta_end_dot_

 he again avoids answering the question _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk express my ass _meta_end_dot_
