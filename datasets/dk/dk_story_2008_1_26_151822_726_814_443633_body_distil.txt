  that s from my post of august _meta_number_ref_th of last year but it might as well be from today _meta_end_dot_

 the situation as it stands today is that the senate has tied itself in knots over the question of whether or not to grant retroactive amnesty from legal liability to the biggest telecommunications corporations in america to spare them the expense of having to defend themselves in court from charges that they illegally conspired with the administration to violate the privacy of millions of americans _meta_end_dot_

 the answer by the way of whether or not to grant that amnesty is no _meta_end_dot_

 the administration and its apologists in congress contend that these companies shouldn t be punished for helping the government fight terrorism but the reality is that current law already protects telecom companies who take these sorts of actions _meta_end_dot_

 all they have to do is come to court and show the judge that they were either acting pursuant to a warrant see _meta_number_ref_ usc _meta_number_ref_ d _meta_number_ref_ or a request by competent law enforcement authorities though those are few and far between it would seem such as the attorney general that the information served a valid national security purpose see _meta_number_ref_ usc _meta_number_ref_ d _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ usc _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the telecom giants though didn t do that _meta_end_dot_

 though they retain some of the highest priced legal counsel available only one telecom company bothered to actually check with their lawyers before rolling over for the the bushies and that company qwest reached the conclusion that the informal request made of them was insufficient legal cover under the law and declined to cooperate unless more and better assurances were forthcoming _meta_end_dot_

 for his trouble by the way qwest ceo joseph nacchio found his company suddenly out of the running for millions of dollars worth of federal contracts not to mention finding himself just as suddenly facing federal insider trading charges that could land him in prison _meta_end_dot_

 surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 all the other telecom companies rolled for bush though _meta_end_dot_

 and now the pretzeldent says he wants to pay them back for their cooperation by granting them amnesty from liability _meta_end_dot_

 only that s supposedly up to congress under our constitution now set aside that the argument of the bush apologists to this point has been that the brave americans at the telecom companies have been doing this out of pure patriotism and concern for the nation s safety _meta_end_dot_

 you have to set that aside because the truth is that as soon as these super patriots don t get paid this supposedly vital cooperation doesn t mean shit to them _meta_end_dot_

 here s what s more important in this _meta_end_dot_

 back in august the congress was driven into a panic by the administration a panic that resulted in the passage of a sloppily written and insanely overbroad fisa revision _meta_end_dot_

 but take careful note of how bush did this in august bush dictated the terms of the bill he wanted to congress and congress like the telecoms rolled over for it rather than delay their recess _meta_end_dot_

 bush told them what he wanted in the bill threatened to veto any bill that didn t have exactly what he wanted and further threatened to use his constitutional powers to actually hold the congress in session against its will until they passed the bill he wanted _meta_end_dot_

 and in august the congress gave him what he wanted _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward to the present day with that law now set to expire in february _meta_end_dot_

 unsure of how to proceed on telecom amnesty and remember this is easy the answer is no the senate offers to extend the law for an additional _meta_number_ref_ days so that the congress can work out a deal _meta_end_dot_

 bush s response _meta_end_question_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 in august this very bill was so important to bush that he threatened to veto anything else and to force the congress to stay in session until they gave him the custom built law he wanted _meta_end_dot_

 now congress offers to extend the very same law for _meta_number_ref_ days and bush threatens to veto it _meta_end_dot_

 yes the same one he practically wrote himself when he stomped his feet and held his breath back in august _meta_end_dot_

 now that bill isn t good enough for him _meta_end_dot_

 and what s the difference between now and august _meta_end_question_

 in august we hadn t yet found out the details of how and the extent to which the administration had asked the telecoms to break the law on their say so _meta_end_dot_

 but now we know and suddenly the law watb bush screamed his lungs out for in august is veto bait in january _meta_end_dot_

 so here s the deal _meta_end_dot_

 the message to bush here is f you _meta_end_dot_

 do it _meta_end_dot_

 veto this _meta_end_dot_

 go ahead you re gonna veto the exact same law you swore to god we had to pass in august or we d all die _meta_end_question_

 f you _meta_end_dot_

 do it _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not that i think you won t _meta_end_dot_

 you will _meta_end_dot_

 but f you anyway _meta_end_dot_

 you didn t bother asking for retroactive telecom amnesty in august because you didn t need it _meta_end_dot_

 and you didn t need it because nobody had found out that you d twisted their arms into breaking the law for you _meta_end_dot_

 that s why you re threatening to veto an extension of the only law you said in august would save our lives _meta_end_dot_

 by your own claims you d be playing with the lives of the americans you re charged with protecting _meta_end_dot_

 either you were lying in august and now everyone knows you were or you re aiding and abetting terrorism now _meta_end_dot_

 take your pick moron _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly any congress that doesn t send this message is unworthy to sit as a national legislature _meta_end_dot_

 again what was true in august is doubly true now _meta_end_dot_

 there is something fundamentally wrong here
