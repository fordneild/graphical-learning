  ice dance is not my favorite discipline of figure skating but this year features a lot more dancing and a lot less posing than some years i can remember even the french teams are actually dancing for a change _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i m told there s some basketball on _meta_end_dot_

 p how s your team pair doing _meta_end_question_

 are the refs judges completely blowing it or what _meta_end_question_
