  let s say you were trying to teach a pig to behave like a prize winning sheep dog in a herding contest _meta_end_dot_

 pigs being pigs and sheep being sheep this is challenging to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 but even without the benefit of a piglet named babe and a secret code word if you were extraordinarily patient you might after awhile get the animals to cooperate and mimic a few of the maneuvers _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of things go without saying you d have to know what it is the sheep dog does _meta_end_dot_

 it would be damn helpful to have experience working with animals particularly sheep and dogs _meta_end_dot_

 which brings us to the latest fascinating announcement in stem cell research and the obligatory right wing spin _meta_end_dot_

 via the scientific activist mr _meta_end_dot_

 spinmeister neglected to mention a few key facts in his apologetic zeal to lay the wreath of discovery at the feet of george bush _meta_end_dot_

 to make a a skin cell behave like an embryonic stem cell a couple of things go without saying you d have to know what an embryonic stem cell does _meta_end_dot_

 it would be damn helpful to have worked with human cells particularly skin cells and embryonic stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 and that might be an obstacle if you happened to live in a country where having the latter is an expensive over regulated pain in the ass specifically because of the unpopular policy of a certain unpopular president _meta_end_dot_

 which may explain in part why this breakthrough occurred in japan _meta_end_dot_

 the technique also involves procedures taken from somatic nuclear cell transfer _meta_end_dot_

 that could be spun by shameless political operatives as the first step in cloning replicants which will of course turn on their arrogant secular makers and teach them a righteous lesson for daring to play god _meta_end_dot_

 but my question is a little more practical this kind of progress is virtually impossible without ongoing side by side research produced from embryonic stem lines _meta_end_dot_

 any chance the right wing will grudgingly accept the critical role of embryonic stem cell research in this breakthrough and recognize that our current policy directly hampers us scientists from carrying it further _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe that pig can learn how to fly like a bird too _meta_end_dot_
