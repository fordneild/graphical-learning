  thanks karl for making sure that the republican party continues to be the bush republican party _meta_end_dot_

 this piece is by joseph curl who is your typical blatantly dishonest right wing shill _meta_end_dot_

 note wow _meta_end_exclamation_

 a seven point rise _meta_end_exclamation_

 aside from the bragging about _meta_number_ref_ percent approval rating note how dishonest this claim is two polls pegged bush at _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the first gallup now has him at _meta_number_ref_ percent the other is pew which now has him at _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_question_

 a fox news poll which had bush at _meta_number_ref_ percent just before the petraeus testimony _meta_end_dot_

 and both those _meta_number_ref_ percents where from late july _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at the pre petraeus testimony numbers they were _meta_number_ref_ percent for pew and _meta_number_ref_ percent for gallup _meta_end_dot_

 in other words bush s numbers have gone down since the petraeus dog and pony show not up seven points as curl claims _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the piece is no better _meta_end_dot_

 just more of karl rove s math at work _meta_end_dot_
