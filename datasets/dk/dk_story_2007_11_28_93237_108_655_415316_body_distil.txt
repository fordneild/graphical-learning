  the traditional media loves to swim in schools following a comfortable narrative _meta_end_dot_

 once they ve decided who is a maverick which former mayor has foreign policy experience and who is a popular president little things like facts aren t allowed to spoil the story _meta_end_dot_

 every now and then the school of media fish catch a flash of color and seemingly as one they flip around and wiggle off in a new direction _meta_end_dot_

 this week there seem to be two new narratives on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 one is the sudden discovery of mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 in two recent polls huckabee has climbed to a statistical tie in iowa and the press has been eager to launch the story of huckabee as that funny unexpected second chance from hope the guy who came out of nowhere to challenge the big dogs _meta_end_dot_

 however there s one funny little point missing from the press s huckagazna _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to have a vague memory that huckabee came in second at the iowa straw poll three months ago where he showed _meta_percent_ref_ to romney s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 two of the last three polls had it _meta_number_ref_ for huck _meta_number_ref_ for willard not that big a swing for chuck norris bff if the staw poll can be taken as a measure of activist sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly the press is making zero mention of the guy who came in third at the iowa straw poll sam brownback _meta_end_dot_

 in august brownback finished only three points behind huckabee while drawing from the same rw evangelical base _meta_end_dot_

 in october brownback departed the race _meta_end_dot_

 is it surprising that the brownback adherents ended up in huckabee s camp _meta_end_question_

 it shouldn t be _meta_end_dot_

 both of them appeal to the same creationist crowd who view willard as a heretic and rudy an apostate _meta_end_dot_

 what s happening in iowa is not about huckabee s skills or his progressive conservatism or his two word plan for immigration control _meta_end_dot_

 what s lifting huck is simply religious bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 notice how readily religious prejudice is justified as a tool of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the real story here is that the press is tired of not having a story _meta_end_dot_

 the republican race has been so marked by lack of enthusiasm and overwhelming indecision that they re ready to seize on anything that can be the core of a narrative thread no matter how ugly _meta_end_dot_

 so when republicans start running those ads using sexism against clinton or racism against obama just remember that all candidates have aspects of their biographies that can be beneficial or not
