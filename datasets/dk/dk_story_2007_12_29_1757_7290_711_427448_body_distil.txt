  as has been noted across wwwland benazir bhutto said in a november _meta_number_ref_ interview with david frost that ahmed omar saeed sheikh killed osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 the see we told you so response of many bloggers ignored the fact that sheikh omar has been held in custody since february _meta_number_ref_ for the killing of daniel pearl a crime for which he was convicted in july _meta_number_ref_ and sentenced to death _meta_end_dot_

 whether he actually did or not is much debated but there is no question he is incarcerated nor has there been much mention of what bhutto told bbc america a month before the frost interview on october _meta_number_ref_ perhaps just perhaps bhutto misspoke when she said sheikh omar had murdered osama _meta_end_question_

 not forgotten because the situation is no longer dire starting on monday the hybrid united nations african union mission unamid will take over from the current au operation with some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops and more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ police and civilian staff _meta_end_dot_

 still missing from the effort to quell the violence in darfur is adequate equipment particularly helicopters _meta_end_dot_
