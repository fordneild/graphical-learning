  john mccain and mitt romney do not like each other _meta_end_dot_

 actually it might be said that they hate each other _meta_end_dot_

 their feud is spilling over into the tradmed despite the usual reluctance to write anything bad about mccain they and everyone else dislike romney and have no such reluctance about willard _meta_end_dot_

 this is unfortunate for the tradmed because it steps on their story line that it s dems that are always divided and it s always an opening or something good for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 but the enmity in republican circles is deep and profound _meta_end_dot_

 and it s still not clear what fading huckabee s voters will do _meta_end_dot_

 romney now and mccain never _meta_end_question_

 the same goes for rudy s voters with romney _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile mr _meta_end_dot_

 head of the gop gave a speech that no one cared about yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and why should they _meta_end_question_

 pity the gop voter _meta_end_dot_

 they don t like their candidates they are getting tired of their president and talk radio keeps yelling at them in betweeen the candidates yelling at each other _meta_end_dot_

 hmmm _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough to make a voter vote democratic _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that s why voters keep turning out in record numbers for the contested d primaries _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t say i blame them _meta_end_dot_

 note markos will be providing commentary about the primary on larry king live tonight so tune in _meta_end_dot_
