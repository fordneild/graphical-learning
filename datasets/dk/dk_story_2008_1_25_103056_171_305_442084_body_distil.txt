  in a fascinating piece in the new england journal of medicine lawrence d _meta_end_dot_

 brown columbia s mailman school of public health writes about the amazing noncollapsing u s _meta_end_dot_

 health care system is reform finally at hand _meta_end_question_

 while we have written about how bad things are and how close to falling apart the system appears brown writes about the meta stable collapse _meta_end_dot_

 america s medical system seems always on the verge of collapsing but never seems to finish the job _meta_end_dot_

 indeed what makes this article interesting is the analysis of why the collapse hasn t happened _meta_end_dot_

 brown makes an excellent point about the existence and importance of the safety net but my own observations of community hospitals is that things are worse this time than at any time in the last _meta_number_ref_ years or so _meta_end_dot_

 crowded emergency rooms emergency departments and lack of inpatient bed capacity has grown more intense and at a time in the economic cycle when things were in comparison to what s coming good _meta_end_dot_

 there s no lack of moral urgency around here or out there _meta_end_dot_

 kaiser has an ongoing health care poll and here are some stats from the latest one in december _meta_end_dot_

 first what people want the candidates to talk about hint despite the surge it s iraq followed by health care next in terms of what issue people care about in choosing a president it s iraq followed by health care and the economy although republicans care more about character and experience than democrats who care about issues indies are more like democrats this year and care more about issues according to the poll lastly if we look at the indies as swing voters here s what aspect of health care they focus on all of the above argues that this time out the amazing always collapsing but never collapsed medical system does have impetus for reform from the public _meta_end_dot_

 so back to brown and the nejm this is not _meta_number_ref_ and the right of center picture is changing _meta_end_dot_

 a democratic wh win in _meta_number_ref_ along with the realignment in congress in _meta_number_ref_ is likely to move things in a progressive direction and progressive ideas are on the rise _meta_end_dot_

 the time for health care reform may actually be more likely because of where the public wants to go leaders lead best when that s true _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless brown s history and perspective are worth studying because there s no question that what the public really wants is reasonable costs _meta_end_dot_

 government programs are fine so long as people don t feel the costs are falling on them exception made for children where people are willing to pay _meta_end_dot_

 there is no compelling demand to cut government programs good bye gop talking points _meta_end_dot_

 still reform will not be easy _meta_end_dot_

 keep all of that in mind fpr perspective as we move forward in discussions of health reform a major topic for _meta_number_ref_ for all the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 it can happen but we ll have to make it happen _meta_end_dot_

 same as it ever was for just about anything _meta_end_dot_
