  my good friend and partner jerome armstrong makes a tired electability argument over at his joint _meta_end_dot_

 jerome is too smart to not know the answer _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy iowa missouri colorado new mexico arkansas virginia ohio and nevada _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes already past the _meta_number_ref_ sure things that jerome thinks hillary gets and really florida _meta_end_dot_

 so if nothing else changed from _meta_number_ref_ that would be a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that obama will be competitive elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 what does jerome really think that latinos will choose mccain over obama after _meta_number_ref_ months of republican immigrant bashing in the news which will happen whether mccain joins in or not or that women will sit november out _meta_end_question_

 mccain is hated in alaska for his position on anwar _meta_end_dot_

 obama is also against such drilling of course but they expect that out of a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 a republican who opposes it is a traitor _meta_end_dot_

 alaska would be my sleeper call for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 arizona would be in play _meta_end_dot_

 montana could be in play _meta_end_dot_

 kentucky could be in play _meta_end_dot_

 west virginia could be in play _meta_end_dot_

 florida might be in play _meta_end_dot_

 and if nothing else obama would help close the margin in a lot of red states forcing cash strapped republicans to play defense across something closer to a _meta_number_ref_ state strategy than the inevitable _meta_number_ref_ state strategy we ll see out of clinton _meta_end_dot_

 heck you re seeing it in this primary with obama running in every state while clinton brags about sitting out the various states in an attempt to minimize his victories in places like louisiana and washington _meta_end_dot_

 she increases the battlefield over _meta_number_ref_ no doubt but not as wide as obama does through sheer appeal to independents and even some republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and yes running tighter in red states matters _meta_end_dot_

 not only does it build toward the future the _meta_number_ref_ state strategy of course but it certainly matters to democrats running down the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 go around the country especially in red states like i have and there s no doubt that just about ever red state democrat on the ballot wants obama headlining this november _meta_end_dot_

 now if someone argues that hillary is not electable i ll roll my eyes just as much as i am at the notion that obama doesn t have a path to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 they both do _meta_end_dot_

 and while it s not the same path we ll be favored to win the white house no matter who the nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 any statements to the contrary are quite frankly lacking in reality _meta_end_dot_
