  here s a personal perspective on the topic _meta_end_dot_

 the short answer is yes of course _meta_end_dot_

 blogs have been respectable for a few years now ever since a few early adapters in traditional media decided to emulate the free form practice of the innovators and become their version of bloggers themselves ana marie cox is a natural blogger joe klein not so much _meta_end_dot_

 of course as with time the fastest way to learn how to blog is to hire a blogger or buy one _meta_end_dot_

 there are some well established blogs now both the ny times and the wapo have blog index pages _meta_end_dot_

 on the ny times page you can see blogs ranging well beyond politics and at wapo there s both familiar names and awkward formats _meta_end_dot_

 dan froomkin s excellent white house watch is listed in blogs it has comments but reads more like a column and the comments are hard to find _meta_end_dot_

 andrew cohen s bench conference will be missed by the way without gonzo to kick around it couldn t have been as much fun to write _meta_end_dot_

 speaking off the record with more than a few journalist friends the strong impression one gets is a generational one with younger reporters embracing the format and older management and reporters keeping it at arm s length i suppose one can generalize the same about readers based on pew data _meta_end_dot_

 but what s more interesting to me is the way blogs and internet culture have seeped into non political arenas _meta_end_dot_

 one of the more entertaining experiences about setting up the flu wiki and accompanying forum was the reaction from academia particularly library science _meta_end_dot_

 in the early days c _meta_number_ref_ there was quite a kerfuffle over the legitimacy of online sourcing see this archived piece called more mistakes with authority _meta_end_dot_

 to get a flavor _meta_end_dot_

 we took pains to try and explain the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous which even today people have trouble with _meta_end_dot_

 the argument and distinction between content as validation vs _meta_end_dot_

 credentials is one that will never cease linked content can be sourced and checked _meta_end_dot_

 judith miller and jayson blair had credentials from a prominent media entity but not all bloggers and or their material are quality _meta_end_dot_

 three years later the on line community approach represented by flu wiki and others has been validated in multiple ways _meta_end_dot_

 invited presentations to cdc and hhs audiences peer reviewed academic poster presentations participation on the site by library science folks who helped organize our links page links by local government health departments and international media sites and participation in a government sponsored blog _meta_end_dot_

 government sponsored blog _meta_end_question_

 huh _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out there s a number of them _meta_end_dot_

 i knew about the hhs pandemic flu leadership blog now archived because of my participation and saw secretaries leavitt and chertoff get bitten by the blogging bug leavitt s is a far better read and at times reads as a travelogue _meta_end_dot_

 and recently i was interviewed by the aids gov blog which is an interesting communication experiment and more open than traditional heavy handed one way communication _meta_end_dot_

 here s my favorite government blog though chronicling the stephen colbert portrait tour _meta_end_dot_

 in any case at a recent emergency preparedness conference i attended the conversation drifted to new media and its uses _meta_end_dot_

 whereas most of the audience had its doubts about whether blogs and wikis could be depended upon to convey accurate information the journalist on the panel along with the bloggers in the audience had no such doubts _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly it was citing the government blogs and their existence that was more convincing to the skeptics in the audience and on the panel _meta_end_dot_

 the observation that people say they are more likely to go to non government sources along with the obvious point that even sans approval people will go to the internet for information didn t hurt the argument that non government bloggers are part of the conversation with or without permission _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time similar to how library sciences folks read and contributed to flu wiki while others were questioning the validity and legitimacy of the medium the preparedness posts here at daily kos are read by and sometimes commented on by emergency managers and health professionals regardless of skepticism from other quarters _meta_end_dot_

 that s certainly true of the flu blogs which include readers from public health and medicine as well as academia _meta_end_dot_

 so in a similar vein to jay rosen s essay from _meta_number_ref_ i think the issue of legitimacy is over _meta_end_dot_

 when the library of congress has its own blog it s time to move on to look at content and not form _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about content and links blogging plus or minus bloggers is now mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by demfromct an example of the rapid response blogs offer in real time commenters note to add this i would also add in both cases lives were saved _meta_end_dot_
