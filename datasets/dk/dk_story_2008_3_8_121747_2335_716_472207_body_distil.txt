  rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve king r ia is a knuckle biting coward remember when republicans feared truly scary things like death _meta_end_question_

 you could hardly understand them sometimes through their chattering teeth and over the embarrassing odors emanating from their pants but they used to at least insist that the specter of death be the chit they d trade things like american values tm like civil liberties for _meta_end_dot_

 perrspectives reminds us of the sad republican history of pantsbrowning but king really raises the wuss factor to the nth degree here doesn t he _meta_end_question_

 now americans can t elect our own president for fear someone might _meta_end_dot_

 dance _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair though this would be radical islamodancism _meta_end_dot_

 so there s that _meta_end_dot_

 that s the new test i guess _meta_end_dot_

 a republican presidency is a success if terrorists don t kill americans on their watch _meta_end_dot_

 but a democratic presidency fails if anyone dances _meta_end_dot_

 let em dance _meta_end_dot_

 let em declare anything they want _meta_end_dot_

 i thought if you weren t actually dead that was a victory for us _meta_end_dot_

 apparently not enough though _meta_end_dot_

 gotta have a worldwide war on jubilation before king will be ready to commit to a clean pair of jockeys _meta_end_dot_

 the kicker is they think americans will think this stuff makes them sound like leaders _meta_end_dot_
