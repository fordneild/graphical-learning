  one of the great things about the schip discussion wherein the bush administration and republicans are on the wrong side of the will of the american people is that it has brought out the canards and straw men of socialized medicine as the reason to vote against the real reason is to try and shore up an unpopular president politically even many republicans voting to sustain bush s veto hate being in that position and know they re getting hammered over this at home _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble with that position is that this isn t _meta_number_ref_ where reactionary forces could rail against medicare as socialized medicine with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 in fact polling repeatedly has brought up the response who cares if schip is socialized medicine _meta_end_question_

 but do republicans really want to argue on the basis of what s socialized and what s not _meta_end_question_

 will we return to turnpikes run by private companies or will we continue to drive on socialized interstates pushed by that commie pinko president dwight eisenhower _meta_end_question_

 do we send our kids to socialized public schools or do we support vouchers for private education that s a hot one _meta_end_question_

 or do we take a third way and educate our kids at home lots of folks do for various reasons _meta_end_question_

 hey how about fire departments _meta_end_question_

 does anyone have a problem with a socialized fire department _meta_end_question_

 well apparently some do _meta_end_dot_

 did you know that with enough money you can buy special treatment _meta_end_question_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 but why bother hiring aig when you can hire blackwater _meta_end_question_

 naomi klein writing in the nation and were we kidding about blackwater _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_
