  do you ever click on to half a dozen links on a blogger s blogroll _meta_end_question_

 you know what i m talking about right _meta_end_question_

 the list of other bloggers that a blogger thinks are fantastic good or at least interesting enough to include on the left or right margin of her or his own site _meta_end_dot_

 the list that is often filled with a bunch of dead links because they haven t been updated since october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the incestuous list on which interesting enough often seems to mean a fair amount of i ll link your blog if you ll link mine _meta_end_dot_

 i ve uncovered some sites that i now visit every day by being an avid clicker of blogrolls _meta_end_dot_

 as well plenty of sites that make me wonder how they wound up on any body s blogroll _meta_end_dot_

 however most people i know ignore blogrolls as they would any fine print _meta_end_dot_

 for quite a while now kossacks have had the capability for doing what standalone bloggers do provide everyone with their own blogrolls _meta_end_dot_

 because most of the _meta_number_ref_ recommended daily kos diarists i ve checked out so far in february have empty blogrolls _meta_end_dot_

 thirty blank lines _meta_end_dot_

 no link to anybody _meta_end_dot_

 as i write this four of the diaries on the recommended list fall into that category _meta_end_dot_

 two others have only a single listing to their personal web site _meta_end_dot_

 the other two diarists provide numerous links _meta_end_dot_

 that sample pretty much matches what i ve seen the whole month _meta_end_dot_

 which makes the question i started out with perhaps more pertinent _meta_end_dot_

 does anybody read other people s blogrolls other than to see if their site is listed on it _meta_end_question_

 days since misery accomplished _meta_number_ref_ cost per minute of the iraq war and occupation according to the congressional research service _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
