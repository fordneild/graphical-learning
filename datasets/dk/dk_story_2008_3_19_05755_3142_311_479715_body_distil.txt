  did a book or a writer change your life _meta_end_question_

 one changed mine _meta_end_dot_

 it was narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave a slim volume first published in _meta_number_ref_ and lent to me when i was _meta_number_ref_ by the editor of a newspaper where i had a sweeping up job _meta_end_dot_

 frederick douglass became my hero and remains so today _meta_end_dot_

 two other books also spun me around _meta_end_dot_

 one was the invisible government written by david wise and thomas ross and published in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 theirs was the first expos of the central intelligence agency national security agency defense intelligence agency and other covert operations written at a time when spooks and ex spooks didn t appear as cable channel analysts and _meta_percent_ref_ of americans didn t know that their government was overthrowing other governments _meta_end_dot_

 the cia tried to censor their book and when that failed sought to get bad reviews written _meta_end_dot_

 this was of course before it became known how many journalists the cia used to get its message into the media _meta_end_dot_

 then in _meta_number_ref_ custer died for your sins was written by vine deloria jr a member of the dakota and lakota peoples of the standing rock indian reservation _meta_end_dot_

 that book spurred me to join the american indian movement of which i was a member until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday i finished for the second time and i rarely read books twice these days does anyone have that much spare time the shock doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism by naomi klein _meta_end_dot_

 this book has had a greater impact on me than anything i have read in many years _meta_end_dot_

 not that i didn t know anything about what she wrote but seeing it all together brought so much into focus in a rarely done way _meta_end_dot_

 so back to where i started what about you _meta_end_question_

 did a book or writer change you _meta_end_question_

 days since mission accomplished _meta_number_ref_ the overnight news digest is posted _meta_end_dot_
