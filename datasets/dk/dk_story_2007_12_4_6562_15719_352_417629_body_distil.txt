  liberal hawk peter beinart parrots the fondest wishes of those on both the right and the left who want to pretend that iraq no longer matters _meta_end_dot_

 beinart like his pro war buddies on the right want to pretend that the fact that only _meta_number_ref_ americans g i s are dying a month in iraq is great news and knocks iraq from the public s mind _meta_end_dot_

 and it may be true that iraq is getting less discussion in the national press than before _meta_end_dot_

 but the discontent in iraq was never driven by media coverage _meta_end_dot_

 remember support for the war in iraq collapsed without a single strong anti war voice in either our political world or in the national media _meta_end_dot_

 not a one _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t until rep _meta_end_dot_

 murtha turned against the war on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that anyone of significant stature became a strong anti war voice _meta_end_dot_

 support for the war nationwide had already cratered at that point _meta_end_dot_

 so national media coverage of the war has never had an impact on public perceptions on the war _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the public has thumbed its nose at the media and arrived at their anti war conclusions all on their own based on their own observations whether via the internet or via local coverage of local fallen heroes _meta_end_dot_

 and all recent surveys on national priorities continue to show that iraq indeed remains a top priority for the electorate especially for democrats and independents _meta_end_dot_

 if anything the relative quiet on iraq is a sign that the debate is over _meta_end_dot_

 there is no longer any doubt that the american people have decided they want out and there s no new information possible that could change their minds _meta_end_dot_

 beinart thinks this shifting priorities has hurt hillary as her strengths on national security are blunted _meta_end_dot_

 but in fact hillary s decline can be traced to her vote on that recent iran bill that mimicked her war authorization vote back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in other words democratic voters saw that hillary hadn t learned her lesson on iraq and it allowed her opponents to seed fresh doubts about her judgment on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 come november _meta_number_ref_ voters will look at the candidates figure out which one of them want to bring our troops home safe and sound to their families and cast their ballots accordingly _meta_end_dot_
