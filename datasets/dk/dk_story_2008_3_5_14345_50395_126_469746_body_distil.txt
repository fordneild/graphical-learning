  from a reader remember the rats ad used against gore in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 the bush campaign was mocked in its claims of ignorance because ad makers pore over every detail of their ads before releasing them for broadcast _meta_end_dot_

 there was a concerted effort by clinton s ad people to make obama look darker more sinister and with a wider nose _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence is indisputable _meta_end_dot_
