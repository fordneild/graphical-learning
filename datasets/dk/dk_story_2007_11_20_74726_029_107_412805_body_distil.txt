  the news this morning is full of signs of peace settling over baghdad as increased troop levels help to quiet the insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 wait wait wait _meta_end_dot_

 that was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no here s how nice things are in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 darn it that was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this must be the right article _meta_end_dot_

 sorry again _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 let s just skip _meta_number_ref_ and go straight to today _meta_end_dot_

 ah paradise _meta_end_dot_

 don t misunderstand _meta_end_dot_

 i very much hope that this period does represent a real sustained move toward normalcy in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 certainly the millions of iraqi refugees are hoping for the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 after months in which tens of thousands of people were fleeing baghdad each day around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a day are now trickling back _meta_end_dot_

 that really is a good sign _meta_end_dot_

 but there have been a number of lulls in violence and what we re now looking at as the lowest number of attacks since february _meta_number_ref_ only means that normal has been redefined as worse than anything in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as optomistic as i would like to be i can t help noticing that first article the one from a few weeks after the war ended includes this paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 normal is relative _meta_end_dot_
