  word from the senate as debate resumes is that the critical amnesty amendments will be introduced tomorrow and voted on either tomorrow or wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 there are possibly votes tonight including cardin s amendment to sunset the law in four rather than six years which is important because it would ensure the next president would be in office when it was reconsidered and whitehouse s minimization amendment that would give the fisc oversight over how the government deals with the data it collects including destroying superfluous data _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully these votes will be postponed until tomorrow because then we d hopefully at least have senators kennedy and kerry back on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 feingold just spoke on the floor c span_meta_number_ref_ speaking about the importance of external oversight of this surveillance program _meta_end_dot_

 he spoke to newsweek for an online exclusive we know one thing the reporter has been reading the blogs his questions and his discussing the telco issue as amnesty show it _meta_end_dot_

 further demonstration that your involvement and activism on this issue is making an impact _meta_end_dot_

 feingold is being a realist here suggesting that his amendments particularly on amnesty will fail _meta_end_dot_

 that s entirely likely but as i ve argued before getting as many votes on all of the amnesty amendments as possible is critical _meta_end_dot_

 it will strengthen the house s hand in negotiating in the conference agreement since the house s version the restore act does not contain amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 so keep calling your own senators and also the usual crowd _meta_end_dot_

 and as always you can follow today s floor action courtesy of the kossack livebloggers _meta_end_dot_

 update one important thing to keep in mind is that simple majority vote rule which the feingold dodd amendment stripping amnesty will be considered under means a majority of senators voting not _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 so if there are _meta_number_ref_ senators present we win with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
