  it s about time acknowledging the problem of vulnerable and or malfunctioning voting machines is the first step _meta_end_dot_

 dealing with the aftermath of that acknowledgment is another issue entirely it s been seven long years since the infamous hanging chads of the _meta_number_ref_ florida debacle and the greatest democracy on earth still hasn t gotten that democracy part quite right _meta_end_dot_

 it hasn t been of course from a lack of effort _meta_end_dot_

 members of congress most notably representative rush holt and senator barbara boxer among a handful of dedicated others have led the charge for voter verified paper trails and the implementation of a ballot system that american voters can rely upon _meta_end_dot_

 but election reform as the help america vote act of _meta_number_ref_ proved can be a complicated issue made more so by the fact that it gets little attention during the year _meta_end_dot_

 after all the integrity of the ballot isn t as sexy as some other items on the legislative agenda and the media s eyes only seem to drift to the issue right around election day _meta_end_dot_

 and so we continue to play this game _meta_end_dot_

 during the year individual states endeavor to fix this vulnerable and broken system _meta_end_dot_

 molasses like progress is made on a national level as various election reform bills slink through committees _meta_end_dot_

 and as primaries and general elections roll around americans shuffle to the polls touching screens that should never have been certified and trusting their votes to systems that have less verification than atms _meta_end_dot_

 the press in turn does it part with video clips of long lines and blurbs about sporadic machine malfunctions _meta_end_dot_

 and as long as the margin of victory is large enough to make people nod their heads and move along we engage in a national shrug and move along ourselves deceiving ourselves that this fragile system based entirely on trust is worthy of repetition again _meta_end_dot_

 great progress has been made at the state level but congress needs to act with urgency to enact meaningful comprehensive legislation that will restore confidence in our voting system _meta_end_dot_

 most critically there must be an acknowledgment that a patchwork system of voting methods some of which are more secure and verifiable than others is simply unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough to call for reform _meta_end_dot_

 it s not even enough to pass bill requiring reform _meta_end_dot_

 what is needed is an aggressive sustained cooperation between state and federal governments to fully fund a renovation of america s voting procedures _meta_end_dot_

 it s taken our nation seven years to accept that the process by which we exercise our right to vote is deeply and disturbingly flawed _meta_end_dot_

 let it not be another seven years before we fix it _meta_end_dot_
