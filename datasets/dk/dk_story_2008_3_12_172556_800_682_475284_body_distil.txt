  john conyers and _meta_number_ref_ members of the house judiciary committee have rejected the bush administration case for retroactive amnesty for the telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 the following members joined chairman conyers in signing on to the statement representatives howard l _meta_end_dot_

 berman d ca rick boucher d va jerrold nadler d ny robert c _meta_end_dot_

 scott d va melvin l _meta_end_dot_

 watt d nc zoe lofgren d ca sheila jackson lee d tx william d _meta_end_dot_

 delahunt d ma robert wexler d fl linda s nchez d ca steve cohen d tn hank johnson d ga betty sutton d oh brad sherman d ca tammy baldwin d wi anthony d _meta_end_dot_

 this statement is a solid justification for the legislation house leadership introduced yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 it also covers some new ground _meta_end_dot_

 first it found among the telcos a variety of actions at various times with differing justifications in response to administration requests so it was potentially not just qwest _meta_end_dot_

 additionally a variety of actions at various times with differing justifications in response to administration requests making the case critical to be decided by the courts not by congress _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the arguments for blanket retroactive immunity that a decision not to enact it will irreparably harm the relevant carriers and that it will endanger our national security have not been substantiated either in a public or a classified setting this is a strong rebuke for retroactive amnesty and provides what would be a legal responsible and appropriate solution to the amnesty stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 which means of course that the republicans and probably rockefeller will oppose it _meta_end_dot_
