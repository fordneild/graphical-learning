  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 and the hits just keep on comin newsweek s michael hirsh reports that the chimp in chief is planning to lock us into some bullshit unbreachable agreements with iraq before he heads home in a year to milk his legacy as the worst president ever yeah right _meta_end_dot_

 like bush hasn t set a precedent over the last seven years that anything the president doesn t like can be breached willy nilly _meta_end_dot_

 gimme a break _meta_end_dot_

 at the very least we could pull our troops out and replace em with a bunch of scandinavians we kidnap in the middle of the night and air drop over the green zone _meta_end_dot_

 the logistics look doable on paper but we ll need a lot of kevlar parachutes i m not ragging on hirsch by the way _meta_end_dot_

 but i am calling out this article because of something he writes in the final paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 it s an unfinished thought here s what s missing our troops aren t getting killed and maimed in japan _meta_end_dot_

 or germany _meta_end_dot_

 or korea _meta_end_dot_

 or kuwait _meta_end_dot_

 and they didn t get killed in any of those places after truman and eisenhower and bush sr _meta_end_dot_

 effectively declared that major combat operations have ended as commander codpiece did five years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but our troops in iraq are and will continue to be killed and maimed for as long as we stay there _meta_end_dot_

 bodybag after bodyybag will be sent home _meta_end_dot_

 limb after limb will be lost _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe i m wrong but i don t think being in those other countries is costing us nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a month _meta_end_dot_

 so i guess you can mark all that down as a jeer _meta_end_dot_

 with apologies to scandinavia _meta_end_dot_

 keep your legs springy when you land and you ll be fine _meta_end_dot_

 cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
