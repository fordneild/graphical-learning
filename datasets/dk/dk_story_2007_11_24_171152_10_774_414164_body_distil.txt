  scott horton at harper s who s been on fire following several different stories this year looks closely today at last week s buzz surrounding excerpts from scott mcclellan s upcoming book that seemed to indicate president bush s direct involvement in covering up white house involvement in the outing of cia operative valerie plame wilson _meta_end_dot_

 then of course there was the quick clarification issued by mcclellan s publisher claiming that the former press secretary didn t mean to imply the president lied or anything _meta_end_dot_

 which left the whole issue rather muddled _meta_end_dot_

 now today horton posts a providential think through of the allegations and evidence _meta_end_dot_

 after drawing on some of murray waas stellar reporting at the national journal from july _meta_number_ref_ and examining some of the documents provided in the libby trial horton comes up an interesting speculation particularly regarding the possible motivation for libby s pardon that it was not just a reward for loyalty but was a possible cya for bush do go read horton s whole piece particularly if you re hungry for something analytically substantial on this holiday weekend _meta_end_dot_

 it s good stuff _meta_end_dot_
