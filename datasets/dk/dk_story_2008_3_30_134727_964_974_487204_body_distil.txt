  on sunday nouri al maliki admitted defeat in his attempt to crack down on moqtada al sadr s mahdi army in basra _meta_end_dot_

 maliki had begun the week demanding that mahdi forces surrender within _meta_number_ref_ hours calling this a decisive and final battle yet as the disastrous campaign backfired in basra baghdad and elsewhere maliki pathetically extended the rejected deadline until april _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 as patrick cockburn noted maliki s confident prediction that he would crush the mehdi army is turning out to be a dangerous gamble that is fast eroding his authority today maliki appears to have accepted a humiliating compromise offered by sadr h t cernig _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi government will leave the mahdi militia alone which in turn will cease patrolling the streets under arms _meta_end_dot_

 it s a return to the status quo ante except that sadr has demonstrated his power conclusively and maliki his weakness _meta_end_dot_

 the hapless prime minister is trying to portray this as a climb down by sadr naturally _meta_end_dot_

 his government also is talking tough so far western news media have refrained from pointing out how thoroughly maliki has been humiliated _meta_end_dot_

 but the idea that sadr has given way under pressure is scarcely credible after the mahdi army s string of successes this week _meta_end_dot_

 the near disintegration of the iraqi army sent to basra has been the best possible endorsement of sadr s political stature whereas each day brings further disasters for the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 the terms offered by sadr indicate that he is playing the stronger hand _meta_end_dot_

 he is offering maliki a face saving retreat while staking out the moral high ground _meta_end_dot_

 the latter are the same demands sadr was making before tuesday s attack in basra so in effect he s standing his ground while offering an armistice and a cooling off of tensions _meta_end_dot_

 the mahdi army will not give up their weapons as maliki had demanded _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore sadr s offer included other terms as well which the western media have not reported _meta_end_dot_

 arab sources indicate that sadr s nine point proposal demands the withdrawal of iraqi and us forces from basra and even more embarrassingly the retreat of maliki and his defense and interior ministers from basra back to baghdad within _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 with the acceptance of his compromise sadr solidifies his power base in basra _meta_end_dot_

 this iraqi press release shows the extent to which maliki has lost face maliki may have difficulty in holding onto power now _meta_end_dot_

 he s shown the incompetence not only of the best military forces under his direct control but also of the prime minister personally _meta_end_dot_

 for at least five millenia it s been a truism in mesopotamia that leaders if they want to endure must always avoid implicating themselves in military defeat _meta_end_dot_

 by taking charge of operations in basra maliki showed how woefully out of touch he is with iraqi political wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 of course at this stage it should surprise nobody that maliki is incapable of governing _meta_end_dot_

 that was almost fated from the moment his name was floated as a compromise candidate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for maliki a former exile under saddam hussein had no political base in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration s misjudgment in backing yet another returned exile as leader in that badly fractured country has had the predictable consequence that the iraqi government cannot function _meta_end_dot_

 it s fair to say at this date that there is no government in iraq just the mirage of one _meta_end_dot_

 update fighting continues in baghdad and basra and the truce may not be taking hold in fact _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt reports that the substance of the nine point statement released by mr _meta_end_dot_

 sadr on sunday afternoon was hammered out in elaborate negotiations over the past few days with senior iraqi officials some of whom traveled to iran to meet with mr _meta_end_dot_

 sadr _meta_end_dot_

 sadr s spokesman earlier today told reporters that the maliki government had accepted the deal in full _meta_end_dot_

 but after sadr announced the truce a maliki spokesman told reuters that the operation in basra will continue and will not stop until it achieves its goals now reuters is reporting also that mahdi fighters doubt the iraqi government will honor the terms of the truce _meta_end_dot_

 the la times nyt and time all report that fighting is continuing including further us air strikes in basra _meta_end_dot_

 the truce may break down completely then before it could even take hold _meta_end_dot_
