  with yesterday s news of eliot spitzer s link to a prostitution ring his role as a super delegate for hillary clinton has unfortunately become a part of the story _meta_end_dot_

 obviously spitzer s actions are in no way a reflection of clinton s judgement or character _meta_end_dot_

 but it does put an open letter sent out this weekend by super delegate steven grossman the former chairman of the dnc and clinton supporter in a whole new light _meta_end_dot_

 in his appeal grossman urges other democratic super delegates to refuse to be mindless tabulators of primaries and caucuses won or popular votes amassed because all things considered perhaps mr _meta_end_dot_

 grossman and his ilk should spare us their experience and morals and instead respect the will of the voters _meta_end_dot_

 update by kos i ve added grossman s entire letter below the fold _meta_end_dot_
