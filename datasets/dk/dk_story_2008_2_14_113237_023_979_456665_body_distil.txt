  mark penn funny how the states that matter are the ones that hillary clinton happen to win _meta_end_dot_

 who knew _meta_end_question_

 poor new mexico is in limbo still unsure about whether it matters or not since all the votes still haven t been counted _meta_end_dot_

 really has there ever been a more idiotic line of spin in the history of politics the suggestion that because obama didn t win a democratic primary in california or new york that those two solid democratic states are suddenly out of reach for him in november _meta_end_question_

 with that logic it s obvious clinton has no chance in illinois since she got crushed there _meta_end_exclamation_

 but worse than that how is clinton expected to win some of those important states that don t matter like colorado missouri washington minnesota virginia maryland maine delaware iowa and connecticut _meta_end_question_

 well not insulting them as meaningless for one _meta_end_dot_
