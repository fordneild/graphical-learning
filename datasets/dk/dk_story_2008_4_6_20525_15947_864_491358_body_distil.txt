  this month the editors of the american prospect published a pithy little piece subscription required about mark penn as i explained a few months ago in ickes and penn after school behind the bike racks harold ickes who s respected by a wide swath of the democratic party and has always been well to the left of most of the other members let in to the clinton inner circle despises penn and views him as a proxy for dick morris whom ickes has battled for over _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 ickes is probably happy about this as ari melber points out over at the nation penn will still be raking in cash from the campaign and still has conflicts of interest between his private sector clients and hillary clinton why the clinton campaign would even keep him around is baffling he has always sucked _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to find information about his past clients via google searches but he s on a tremendous losing streak one that s rumored to be at least _meta_number_ref_ straight _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t been able to find anything he s won since bill clinton s _meta_number_ref_ reelection in which clinton didn t top _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he polled for al checchi when checchi lost the three way ca gubernatorial primary to jane harman and eventual winner gray davis in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he got fired from the gore campaign in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ his clients included dem gubernatorial primary losers jim blanchard in michigan and andrew cuomo in new york and his candidate jeanne shaheen lost the _meta_number_ref_ nh senate race she s got a different pollster this time around _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he polled for joementum s presidential run and peter deutch s losing fl senate primary against betty castor _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he even polled for asshole silvio berlusconi who in addition to being a far right scumbag did i mention he s a far right scumbag was the sitting prime minister of italy and owned most of the italian media _meta_end_exclamation_

 check out this great historical reenactment of a penn memo to berlusconi the post mortems of the clinton campaign if they are to be useful will have to explain why hillary clinton allowed mark penn to become her svengali or rasputin _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore a full explanation of bill and hillary will need to explain why on her two signature executive endeavors the clinton health care effort and her presidential campaign they allowed people totally unsuited to the task to become hillary s svengalis _meta_end_dot_

 as some will remember the clinton health care plan was headed up by business consulting guru ira magaziner _meta_end_dot_

 brad delong had this to say about magaziner s contribution to the clinton health care debacle it s also not how you win an election _meta_end_dot_

 as a candidate or an office holder you need people around you who can and will tell you what you don t want to hear and to whom you ll listen when you don t like what you re hearing _meta_end_dot_

 she has tremendous talents but based on her two biggest leadership challenges it looks like hillary clinton is too susceptible to the charms of people who tell her what she wants to hear rather than what she needs to hear _meta_end_dot_

 above i referred to a humorous historical reenactment of the communication between penn and berlusconi which ran in the washington monthly two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 here s the final bullet point of that satire that was a satire but it s likely penn has been making a similar argument to clinton for months _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope she stops listening to him _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope that if she won t heed the words of meteor blades that someone she will listen to like vernon jordan will tell her it s time to step aside and acknowledge that barack obama is our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 then obama supporters clinton supporters supporters of other candidates who ve already stepped aside indeed all democrats everywhere across our great land then let us come together around our shared loathing of mark penn and let the healing begin _meta_end_dot_
