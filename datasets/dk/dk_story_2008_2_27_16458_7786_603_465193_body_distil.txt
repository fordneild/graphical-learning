  the last two days have offered up some seriously juicy material in the forms of steve kirby potentially running for senate in south dakota and brock olivo running for house in mo _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the former is a ghoulish zombie who harvested skin off cadavers to turn a pretty penny in cosmetic surgery products wrinkle removers and penis enlargers _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is well dumb as a rock _meta_end_dot_

 so the guy who raids corpses for profit or the guy who thinks he should run for congress because he took a social studies class _meta_end_question_

 which one is more representative of the modern gop _meta_end_question_

 and no i m not going to offer both as an answer _meta_end_dot_

 that d be the easy way out _meta_end_dot_

 update comment of the day by ogre race tracker wiki mo _meta_number_ref_
