  the obama african american turnout in texas is going to be huge _meta_end_dot_

 blacks are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the texas population compared to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent for hispanics _meta_end_dot_

 but they exert a disproportionate influence in the primary electorate today i talked to a reporter working on a piece on the obama movement who had just returned from texas to see the obama ground game close up _meta_end_dot_

 i asked if it lived up to the hype _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he had gone down there cynical not expecting much but had been utterly blown away _meta_end_dot_

 his piece will be out next week i think and i can t wait to read the details _meta_end_dot_

 but bottom line is that obama has run a volunteer driven ground game while the clintons thought they d run an advertising air war _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason obama is outperforming the polls and even my most optimistic vote predictions his volunteer driven ground game is blowing whatever meager operation clinton has completely out of the water _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers are moving dramatically in obama s direction right now _meta_end_dot_

 he s going to win texas and win it comfortably _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing if the texas election were today obama would likely win it by _meta_number_ref_ points regardless what the polls say _meta_end_dot_

 his ground operation is that good _meta_end_dot_

 by the time this thing finally rolls around expect wisconsin like numbers _meta_end_dot_

 obama s victory will be complete _meta_end_dot_
