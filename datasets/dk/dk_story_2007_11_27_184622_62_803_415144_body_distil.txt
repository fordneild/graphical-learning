  check out this hilarious correction time just posted ahh the old republicans say versus what democrats say _meta_end_dot_

 but what does the legislation say _meta_end_question_

 it s not just joe klein who can t read _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the entire corps of editors and journalists at time are incapable of it as well _meta_end_dot_

 they are now all complicit in joe klein s screw up lest they speak up and demand a stronger correction from klein _meta_end_dot_

 every single last one of them _meta_end_dot_

 update and what s with the setup line of the correction _meta_end_question_

 klein didn t say the legislation would allow a court to review targets _meta_end_dot_

 he said it would require it _meta_end_dot_

 they re dishonest from top to bottom a rotten organization at its core _meta_end_dot_

 update ii glenn
