  seriously this is getting embarrassing for the gop even the few decent candidates they can actually convince to run won t stay in the race _meta_end_dot_

 oh darn what a shame _meta_end_dot_

 roberts had been in the race since last may after bailing out of ernie fletcher s administration just in time _meta_end_dot_

 the gop was just pleased as punch to have him in the race partly because if elected he would have been the only african american republican in congress _meta_end_dot_

 sadly that was not in the cards _meta_end_dot_

 yarmuth s louisville based district is the most democratic in kentucky the only one of the state s six districts to go for john kerry in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since being elected he has voted with a majority of democrats _meta_percent_ref_ of the time including on several key votes _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the gop is now turning to the district s former rep anne northup who held this dem leaning district for five terms before losing to yarmuth in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then however she suffered the ignominy of losing the republican nomination to scandal battered incumbent ernie fletcher who himself went on to be crushed in the general election by steve beshear _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder whether northup really wants to risk three big losses in three years with a run against yarmuth who had raised nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ through september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 losing roberts is only the latest in a series of recruiting failures and losses for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 they blew the va sen race by forcing out tom davis in favor of presidential failure jim gilmore _meta_end_dot_

 they failed to recruit scott mcinnis or john suthers for co sen they failed to recruit mike rounds to challenge tim johnson they failed to recruit david wallace for tx _meta_number_ref_ they lost their top four choices for oh _meta_number_ref_ before steve stivers changed his mind and they failed to entice greg ball into the ny _meta_number_ref_ race after their initial candidate andrew saul dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 in addition they are so cash strapped that they ve been forced to recruit as many self funders as they can find for house races not being in a position to help their less affluent candidates financially _meta_end_dot_

 congressional republicans it seems are on the road to nowhere _meta_end_dot_
