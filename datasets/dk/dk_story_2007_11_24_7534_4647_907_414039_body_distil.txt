  you remember that short powerful incredibly moving animation called the inner life of a cell _meta_end_question_

 well turns out the creationist lobby liked it also _meta_end_dot_

 so guess what they did _meta_end_question_

 according to erv who tells me she has investigated this ugly episode complete with plants in the audience someone from the discovery institute got a hold of the video stripped the original credits relabeled it with creationist propaganda and began showing it at creationist revival meetings as if it were their own work _meta_end_dot_

 she has posted what is purported to be the original and plagiarized versions side by side i have no doubt some people could watch that video and see the handiwork of god or allah or buddha etc _meta_end_dot_

 others such as myself might interpret it as an elegant testimony to the power of unguided natural selection operating over trillions of generations _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what one s personal religious beliefs or doubts we all might be so moved with the beauty captured therein that tears well up in our eyes _meta_end_dot_

 but whether you re a young earth biblical literalist an old earth creationist a theistic evolutionist or a secular skeptic there is one thing we can all agree on stealing is wrong and those who steal are to be punished _meta_end_dot_

 it remains to be seen how the grassroots creationist movement will punish the thieves in their midst _meta_end_dot_
