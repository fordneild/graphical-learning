  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote that two days after cheers and jeers made its debut at daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 four years ago today on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while bored out of my mind at work i picked up a pebble and threw it in the big orange pond _meta_end_dot_

 the first edition of cheers and jeers made not a ripple but it did contaminate the pond with mercury _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we garnered a total of _meta_number_ref_ comments in our first ten columns _meta_end_dot_

 by itself there s nothing unique about c j _meta_end_dot_

 the premise is straight out of tv guide and newsweek s conventional wisdom watch with a few extra features added and a dash of piss vinegar _meta_end_dot_

 it s like an open thread on steroids hosted by a middle aged gay man whose idea of exercise is digging a little deeper to snag a booger _meta_end_dot_

 what makes it unique is that so many of you are into boogers too and together we flick our collective arsenal at the jerks of the world while holding our fire on those who do good i ve heard they appreciate this _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always said that i started c j as a way to preserve my sanity during what will forever be regarded as a needlessly dark period in our history _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that no one s perfect but the idiots in charge aren t even making an effort to be mediocre _meta_end_dot_

 i mean they suspended habeas corpus _meta_end_question_

 a couple months ago you put me on your collective payroll a vote of confidence for which i m grateful _meta_end_dot_

 and to have my salary delivered via truckloads of pennies was very very coppery _meta_end_dot_

 today we re replaying our very first lame column to give you a glimpse of what ancient kossack history looks like _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow we kick off our fifth year with a new series that includes shocking new revelations about the front pagers _meta_end_dot_

 i remain your humble nazi loving kkk adoring hate filled and now satan worshipping _meta_end_exclamation_

 left wing smear merchant _meta_end_dot_

 and the bar is open it must be five o clock somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
