  scientists in maryland have reportedly succeeded in creating the world s first functional genome from scratch it s hoped that such artificial microbes could one day be tailored to produce new drugs targeted to infect cancer cells or invasive pathogens or perhaps even produce synthetic oil and other fuels _meta_end_dot_

 the artificial genome contains over half a million base pairs or letters in genetic code _meta_end_dot_

 researchers used as their model the bacterium mycoplasma genitalium but wisely disabled the ability of any microbe that might arise from this breakthrough to infect living cells _meta_end_dot_

 good idea as the name implies m _meta_end_dot_

 genitalium infects the human genital tract _meta_end_dot_
