  for those of us wondering who the republican whispering sweet nothings into joe klein s ear it was right wing republican and top tier bush apologist rep _meta_end_dot_

 pete hoekstra _meta_end_dot_

 democrats in dc think klein is an ally to the point where you have the likes of john kerry craving his approval yet he s no more than a dishonest shill quick to accept bullshit spin without taking the time or effort to understand what he writes _meta_end_dot_

 when called on his inaccuracies he begs off claiming that his tedious job of writing a column a week keeps him from you know understanding and verifying the words he writers _meta_end_dot_

 and time rallies around him without regard to its ethical obligations as a major american news outlet _meta_end_dot_

 compare time s refusal to play do the right thing and admit klein s error to the chicago tribune s correction after it ran an excerpt from klein s column on its op ed pages you d think that wouldn t be so hard but apparently time is vested in the fiction that klein is infallible _meta_end_dot_

 bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 when i turned in both my columns to newsweek editors demanded i justify every single line of the pieces _meta_end_dot_

 every one of them _meta_end_dot_

 they even forced me to rewrite portions that might be construed the wrong way by readers even if my words were still technically correct _meta_end_dot_

 maybe newsweek isn t that diligent with pieces written by their in house columnists like george will or whoever but you d hope they would be _meta_end_dot_

 and if not _meta_end_question_

 they ll get the similar treatment _meta_end_dot_

 as for time it s clear they have nowhere near that level of control over klein he says what he wants when he wants to and the magazine won t hold him accountable when he blows it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they d rather have their entire publication publicly embarrassed than force klein himself to suffer a little personal embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 and klein ever the profile in courage would rather see his publication take the lumps for his f ups than engage in a little personal accountability _meta_end_dot_

 of course his republican puppetmasters are applauding in the background _meta_end_dot_

 mission accomplished _meta_end_exclamation_

 and dc democrats still desperate for his approbation and approval remain mostly silent lest he what _meta_end_question_

 not invite them to his next cocktail party _meta_end_question_

 lest he not call them as a source for his next anti democratic hit piece _meta_end_question_

 klein represents most of what s wrong with the beltway media today _meta_end_dot_

 and the general democratic silence in response except for the one response by rep _meta_end_dot_

 rush holt is quite indicative of the general democratic timidity in a hostile media and political environment _meta_end_dot_

 how many times can you beat that abused puppy without it fighting back _meta_end_question_

 with beltway democrats the abuse they ll tolerate is apparently endless _meta_end_dot_
