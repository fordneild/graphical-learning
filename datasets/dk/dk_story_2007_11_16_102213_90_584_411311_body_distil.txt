  who cares what some idiot blogger says _meta_end_question_

 and why should they care _meta_end_question_

 i use a fakey sounding name _meta_end_dot_

 it s much more interesting when you kill trees to say it and attach no names at all at least i hope it s much more interesting _meta_end_dot_

 whatever it takes let s get it done _meta_end_dot_

 if it makes people feel better that the new york times calls for it that s cool by me _meta_end_dot_

 the times editorial board is right and that s that _meta_end_dot_

 of course mukasey has already been up front about that so here s what we should hope will be the next nyt editorial on the subject if the doj won t prosecute for statutory contempt the two options left are inherent contempt and impeachment _meta_end_dot_

 take your pick as to which one is most appropriate but the bottom line is that bush administration policy puts us squarely in wtf territory _meta_end_dot_
