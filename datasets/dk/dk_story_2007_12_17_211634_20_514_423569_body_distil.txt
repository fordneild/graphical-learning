  here s reid s official statement on the need for more time on deciding on telco amnesty from what i ve heard from senate offices the volume of constituent calls on this issue was huge _meta_end_dot_

 reid referenced that himself when he announced on the floor that consideration of the bill would be postponed we don t like it and kudos to all of you who made that clear to senator reid and to your own senators _meta_end_dot_

 it made a difference _meta_end_dot_

 so keep in touch with them over the next few weeks and make sure they know that the issue is going to be just as critical to us in january as it was today _meta_end_dot_

 and while you re at it a few thanks yous are in order _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to the senators including boxer kennedy wyden brown feingold and bill nelson for engaging with dodd on the floor on this issue showing their willingness to stand with him and help in the filibuster and to reid for listening to us _meta_end_dot_

 but most importantly thank you senator dodd _meta_end_dot_

 update some stats courtesy dodd s whip count crew that s just from dodd s action page and doesn t count everyone who called or e mailed on their own _meta_end_dot_
