  what do you want to do this weekend joe _meta_end_question_

 same as we do every weekend pinky smear democrats _meta_end_dot_

 what makes lieberman so mad he s willing to stand by and whisper sweet nothings in mccain s ear _meta_end_question_

 he s mad because of how radicals have taken over his democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 does calling your supposed own party hyper partisan and accepting john mccain s invitation to dance at the republican prom mean that joe is ready to admit his seething hatred for a party he kicks at every opportunity _meta_end_question_

 no no _meta_end_dot_

 when he says taken over he doesn t mean the people occupying positions in d c or the party chairs or the consultants or anyone actually in a position of power _meta_end_dot_

 he means you _meta_end_dot_

 congratulations _meta_end_dot_

 you without a vote in congress without a dime from k street without a no bid contract or the cushion of a nice check from a think tank you are the people really in control of the party _meta_end_dot_

 well you are in the mind of joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 and really isn t that all that counts _meta_end_question_
