  obama bill clinton huh _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t see the part where obama said the gop s ideas were all the good ones _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama isn t saying anything that couldn t come straight out of crashing the gate that the gop build a vast right wing conspiracy that used its think tanks to create ideas a media machine to sell those ideas and a modernized campaign operation to win elections on those ideas _meta_end_dot_

 yes the gop was the party of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 they were crappy ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but they were ideas _meta_end_dot_

 that s not controversial so i m not sure why the clinton campaign is making such a big deal out of it _meta_end_dot_

 especially welfare reform bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 update edwards joins bill clinton a nicely crafted straw man argument if i ve ever seen one _meta_end_dot_

 bravo john for being an ass and dishonestly distorting what obama said _meta_end_exclamation_
