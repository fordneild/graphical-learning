  i m sure the nrsc s computers use components made by san francisco liberals use search engines run by san francisco liberals utilize networking gear manufactured by san francisco liberals run software applications written by san francisco liberals and maybe even phones iphones and treos and operating systems created and built by san francisco liberals _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure nrsc staffers wear jeans invented by san francisco liberals use services such as netflix tivo ebay and intuit created by san francisco liberals and if they re blogging they re likely using tools built by san francisco liberals _meta_end_dot_

 i went over to their website to see if any of it was designed or built by san francisco liberals and gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 it was _meta_end_exclamation_

 in their code i found snippets from san diego based webside story which also has an office in the san francisco bay area _meta_end_dot_

 they use del icio us a service owned by the san francisco liberals at yahoo _meta_end_dot_

 they use twitter on the site which quite tragically is based in san francisco full of san francisco liberals i bet _meta_end_dot_

 then there s google analytics _meta_end_dot_

 google of course is just full of san francisco liberals being yet another bay area company that dabbles in innovation entrepreneurship tolerance and creativity you know san francisco values _meta_end_dot_

 guess who else google owns _meta_end_question_

 yup youtube which the nrsc also uses on their site _meta_end_dot_

 the damn thing is just loaded with san francisco created widgets and tools _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it s not just their website _meta_end_dot_

 did you know that the nrsc has a facebook page _meta_end_question_

 i bet they didn t even know that facebook is hq d in the sf bay area _meta_end_exclamation_

 but apparently we re still supposed to fear san francisco liberals _meta_end_dot_

 is liberalist a word _meta_end_question_

 not that the rules of grammar or the law apply to republicans of course _meta_end_dot_

 then again the gop s entire campaign against mark udall is that he s a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 same as his cousin in new mexico for that matter so inventing new iterations of the word liberal is pretty much all they ve got _meta_end_dot_

 so taking that into consideration those two paragraphs above are really quite lacking probably written by an intern _meta_end_dot_

 so here let me help out better _meta_end_question_

 i m not much of a wordsmith so i m sure a few additional ultra liberals could ve been included but this is still a dramatic improvement _meta_end_dot_

 and really the event is organized by drinking liberally which i m getting heart palpitations here has the word liberal in its name so i m not sure why that didn t make the nrsc s cut _meta_end_dot_

 but regardless we re now facing a quandry _meta_end_dot_

 the nrsc has promised lots of liberals and ultra liberals at this small dollar fundraiser the kind republicans are allergic to yet all we ve got going are regular americans interested in a responsive open and effective government _meta_end_dot_

 but what can we do _meta_end_question_

 well we can poke them in the eye _meta_end_dot_

 the nrsc is allergic to democrats who have the money to get their messages out to their constituents _meta_end_dot_

 when forced to play on an even field they don t do so well _meta_end_dot_

 so every time they try to demonize this site we should respond with _meta_dollor_ref_ for the candidate they re attacking _meta_end_dot_

 here s mark udall s site _meta_end_dot_

 head on over and thank him for not being afraid of the big bad republican smear machine _meta_end_dot_

 and if you re in the bay area come thank him personally tonight
