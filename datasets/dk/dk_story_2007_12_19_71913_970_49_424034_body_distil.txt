  one of the fascinating narratives of this election is the idea that _meta_number_ref_ is a change election see dhinmi s look at historical comparisons _meta_end_dot_

 given george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and his approval mired in the low _meta_number_ref_ s that s no shock _meta_end_dot_

 still two new national polls released yesterday continue this fascinating narrative _meta_end_dot_

 from diageo hotline bush btw is at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approve disapprove _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the numbers are the reasons why for now giuliani and clinton lead their tightly contested trial heats _meta_end_dot_

 these ranking are of course different than ia edwards is still a factor and nh and subject to change immediately after _meta_end_dot_

 the last time i looked at the usa gallup numbers numbers i used the word volatile _meta_end_dot_

 but things are still where they were nationally right now it still looks like nationally voters are projecting what they want onto their current favorites _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that diageo hotline obama and clinton split the change vote allows her to clean up on experience _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that rudy beats huckabee on experience keeps him afloat but his candidacy is on a much softer foundation since he s going to get clobbered in the early primaries spoiling his i am the most electable narrative and since getting to know him doesn t help him any _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the diageo hotline poll also had a couple of other interesting tidbits the important issues depend on who you ask _meta_end_dot_

 alas the indies are not broken out _meta_end_dot_

 too bad because the election depends on them _meta_end_dot_

 from the boston globe re nh ps if there s any momentum for mccain it s invisible nationally despite what his friends in the press think about his chances _meta_end_dot_

 still anyone who has a stake in the outcome had best stock up on antacids now _meta_end_dot_
