  on the senate floor yesterday harry reid issued a challenge _meta_end_dot_

 too bad his target in that warning is his own democratic senators dodd and feingold _meta_end_dot_

 if he d have forced a few of those open filibusters on the republicans in the past year we could be looking at a completely different dynamic in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but i just want to take a moment to remind senator reid of a letter he sent last month to director of national intelligence john mcconnell about the intelligence documents being used to prop up the administration s demands for telco amnesty only a very few senators have had access to this information information that reid himself has declared critical to senators making a decision on this vote _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say there has been no response from dni mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 we don t want to see a replay of august where members of congress voted on legislation that they had barely read legislation that was used as a cudgel against democrats and a vote that was taken under duress spurred by the administration s lie that the capitol was under immediate harm from a terrorist threat _meta_end_dot_

 senators should not be forced to vote again without access to all of the information they need to make this decision _meta_end_dot_

 call harry reid at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and remind him that we don t want any more uninformed votes by our senators _meta_end_dot_

 tell him that this vote should not be held until the administration makes this information available to all senators _meta_end_dot_

 update reid s staff e mails to clarify that his challenge to senators wishing to talk this to death was intended for republicans who had been insisting on _meta_number_ref_ vote majority on fisa votes _meta_end_dot_

 that is reid told the republicans that if they want _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold they will have to essentially filibuster to do so _meta_end_dot_

 should the votes start tomorrow i hope he holds that line _meta_end_dot_
