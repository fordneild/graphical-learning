  in the course of our fun little dems for mitt game many were just shocked shocked that we d engage in such political knavery such positively nixonian dirty tricks _meta_end_exclamation_

 so i just want to take this opportunity to point out that we didn t start this fire that we learned this tactic in fact from the particular object of our michigan affection the mittster himself _meta_end_exclamation_

 seems that romney himself then an independent disavowing the reagan bush legacy remember that mitt romney crossed over in _meta_number_ref_ to vote for paul tsongas not quite the same as our goals chaos and hilarity but close enough i think _meta_end_dot_

 at least that s what he says now _meta_end_dot_

 you don t say _meta_end_dot_

 frankly that might be true _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to keep track of what is true and when it was true in the ever mutable environment of willard world _meta_end_dot_

 so to those of our counterparts particularly on the right who decry the employment of strategic votes for political gasp reasons _meta_end_dot_

 i humbly submit that this is a tactic we learned precisely from that perfectly coiffed political amoeba they saw so fit to bestow upon us mitt himself _meta_end_dot_
