  the apologists for retroactive immunity for the telecoms are in retreat even if sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid has done no more for now than postpone discussion of the fisa bills until the new year _meta_end_dot_

 if we keep pressure up during the holiday there s a real chance of blocking that provision from becoming law _meta_end_dot_

 the most important factor in yesterday s victory was simply that telecom immunity has almost no constituency _meta_end_dot_

 and retroactive immunity for anybody as a general principle has an even smaller constituency _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as the opposition was able to organize an effective campaign to pressure the senate there was going to be almost no ground left for supporters of immunity to stand upon _meta_end_dot_

 it s called people power _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally right wingers have been taking advantage of this dynamic for years _meta_end_dot_

 narrowly based astro turf campaigns have too often succeeded in swinging members of congress to their side because the left was not paying much attention to what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 the left needs to work on developing its early warning system as well as getting ahead of the curve in letting congress know where we stand on controversial issues _meta_end_dot_

 the public agrees with our positions on a broad range of issues but quite a few members of congress haven t figured that out because we tend to be more reactive in the way we bring pressure _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s fisa victory was also due to the willingness of chris dodd and several other senators to take a stand on principle _meta_end_dot_

 they were ready for a fight even if it meant losing as most observers expected they would initially _meta_end_dot_

 willing to fight that s something we ve seen too little of from democrats _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile republicans have been winning painless victory after victory because the democratic leadership is not making them fight every step of the way _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans have not had to filibuster to get their demands _meta_end_dot_

 democrats did have to filibuster on behalf of their own cause astoundingly _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this will serve as a wake up call to senator reid victory goes to those who are willing to dig in and fight _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget that the victory won by dodd was also due to excellent organization _meta_end_dot_

 he was almost flawless in the way he worked the senate floor because he was prepared to take advantage of every opening _meta_end_dot_

 when dodd seized the opportunity to object to reid s call for unanimous consent on the motion to proceed the initiative basically shifted to his side _meta_end_dot_

 we also witnessed the level of dodd s advance preparation with his outreach to the net roots _meta_end_dot_

 given how little advance notice sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid gave of his plan to bring fisa to the floor on monday dodd s outreach turned out to be remarkably effective _meta_end_dot_

 it s the way it needs to be done _meta_end_dot_

 take the time today to tell senator dodd how much you appreciate his excellent work in blocking this vote _meta_end_dot_
