  after his whole screw people who are losing their homes schtick went over badly john mccain is trying to look like he gives a damn about those struggling americans _meta_end_dot_

 but tpm reader ya makes it clear just how much of this is pretense so to be clear mccain doesn t care if people lose their homes _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago he was happy to say so _meta_end_dot_

 he s since realized that appearing not to care was a mistake and is trying to reverse that accurate perception _meta_end_dot_

 but he still doesn t give a damn and his supposedly brand spankin new plan reflects that _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton are slamming him hard on this one
