  bumped kos chris explains the situation no one thinks obama really needs whatever amount of money we d raise on his behalf in the next couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 this is really about looking for some coattails for the congressional candidates on our fundraising list _meta_end_dot_

 regardless who our presidential nominee is he or she will need a congress full of more and better democrats _meta_end_dot_

 we can do our part to make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 but with all the oxygen being sucked out by the presidential race fundraising for those house and senate candidates has been tough _meta_end_dot_

 this would hopefully give a little boost to those other campaigns before the end of the q_meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ quarter _meta_end_dot_

 still this is controversial move obviously so we re putting it to a vote and it will take a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rds super majority of our communities to pull the trigger _meta_end_dot_

 so vote _meta_end_dot_
