  the cook political report released its most recent house and senate race charts several days ago and most of what movement there is is good for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 five house races al _meta_number_ref_ la _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ and in _meta_number_ref_ have changed rating along with one senate race alaska _meta_end_dot_

 we ve covered most of these races over the past week but here s a breakdown of cook s adjustments _meta_end_dot_

 ak sen stevens likely republican to toss up people used to call ted stevens senator for life _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t anymore _meta_end_dot_

 he is going to face the stiffest democratic challenge of his long career from anchorage mayor mark begich _meta_end_dot_

 i d agree with cook that this is mirabile dictu a tossup and that really just warms my heart _meta_end_dot_

 al _meta_number_ref_ open everett solid republican to lean republican the entry of montgomery mayor bobby bright into this race led cook to jump this race two slots indicating that we can expect a highly competitive race even in this r _meta_number_ref_ district _meta_end_dot_

 that s expanding the map folks _meta_end_dot_

 la _meta_number_ref_ vacant baker likely republican to lean republican we re expanding the map into louisiana too as louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th is in play _meta_end_dot_

 there s going to be a special election in this red district r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we have a particularly strong candidate in former prosecutor and state rep _meta_end_dot_

 don cazayoux _meta_end_dot_

 like bright cazayoux is a conservative democrat but one who can run a strong race and perhaps win in a district that hasn t been competitive for a decade _meta_end_dot_

 il _meta_number_ref_ open weller toss up to lean democratic this race already looked good for us as we had our top choice candidate running il senate majority leader debbie halvorson in a swing district which is likely to go democratic in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 now her republican opponent new lenox mayor tim baldermann has dropped out of the race making this a pretty likely pickup at least until the party finds someone to run _meta_end_dot_

 il _meta_number_ref_ vacant hastert likely republican to lean republican bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 blue majority candidate bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 head over to the blue majority page and give some love to bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ vacant carson likely democratic to lean democratic this is the only negative movement for democrats and we re still favored to win here _meta_end_dot_

 andre carson grandson of the late julia carson is facing a tougher than anticipated challenge from republican state rep _meta_end_dot_

 jon elrod _meta_end_dot_

 carson is still in a pretty good position but we can t take anything for granted _meta_end_dot_

 the election is one week from today _meta_end_dot_

 consider it the flip of il _meta_number_ref_ as much as losing that district would be an embarrassing black eye for the gop so would a loss in democratic in _meta_number_ref_ be such a black eye for us _meta_end_dot_
