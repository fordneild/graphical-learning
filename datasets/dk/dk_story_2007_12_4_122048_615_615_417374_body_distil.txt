  last edition s results clinton obama edwards richardson dodd and the rest _meta_end_dot_

 this thing is becoming a serious race making this week s rankings fairly tough to determine _meta_end_dot_

 so here s your chance to help me in my rankings _meta_end_dot_

 the rules are that i ll rank the candidates in the order i think they d ultimately finish if the primaries started today i e _meta_end_dot_

 iowa and then explain why _meta_end_dot_

 this won t be a list of who i prefer but where i think they d end up right now _meta_end_dot_

 this is your chance to rank them as you see fit but remember rank them as you think they d finish if the elections started today rather than in your personal order of preferences _meta_end_dot_

 this is an effort to gauge the current state of the campaign not where you want it to end up next january and february _meta_end_dot_
