  those of you who have seen me speak at events the last year have probably heard my long running theory on why hillary would inevitably collapse since i never did a q a where i wasn t asked about how to take down clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it went something like this hillary has put together a sort of coalition team of consultants and advisors spanning the ideological spectrum of the party _meta_end_dot_

 my reasoning was that this coalition would hold so long as she was in the lead _meta_end_dot_

 but as the other candidates got better known and she started slipping that coalition would fray and they d start using the press to fight their internal turf battles further accelerating her decline _meta_end_dot_

 well the initial decline like lieberman s in _meta_number_ref_ didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 even as obama and edwards became better known clinton increased her leads _meta_end_dot_

 she was defying gravity _meta_end_dot_

 her debate performances were stellar and she was running a tight ship _meta_end_dot_

 she had effectively eliminated her iraq vote as a negative _meta_end_dot_

 and given how safe obama was playing it i thought damn she s going to pull it off but then hillary made mistakes the biggest being her iran vote suddenly telegraphing to everyone that she had not in fact learned her lesson from the iraq debacle _meta_end_dot_

 it s a vote i m sure she wishes she could have back because suddenly her campaign was on the defensive and this was a shocker she stumbled and a gleeful press piled on _meta_end_dot_

 and now as her poll numbers are sagging and her inevitability in serious doubt the second half of my prediction is starting to play out _meta_end_dot_

 the knives are certainly out ezra criticizing a penn media appearance piles on keep an eye on whether more of the campaign s internal battles are fought in the press _meta_end_dot_

 there s likely a furious effort right now to clamp down on the public recriminations _meta_end_dot_

 but the union busting penn certainly has a lot of enemies and deservedly so _meta_end_dot_

 and they smell blood in the water _meta_end_dot_
