  having zoomed to the top of the republican presidential field mike huckabee is apparently finding the view from the top isn t so much fun because once you get there people actually start paying attention when you screw up _meta_end_dot_

 and since the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto the huckster has been absolutely on fire and not in a good way uh apologies _meta_end_question_

 governor i am sure you d like to blame this on bill clinton or somebody but this is a bit extreme _meta_end_dot_

 anyway huckabee has a fascinating take on this whole pakistan business apparently it underscores the need for a border fence _meta_end_dot_

 because it s all about illegal immigration six hundred and sixty _meta_end_exclamation_

 good god man _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s almost two whole pakistani immigrants per congressional district stealing our jobs _meta_end_exclamation_

 even for huckabee this is an unbelievably idiotic statement especially considering the very serious foreign policy concerns associated with pakistan like say the fact that it s an increasingly unstable nation with a sizable nuclear arsenal _meta_end_dot_

 to try to twist bhutto s assassination into an argument against illegal immigration would be a hilarious political contortion if it weren t actually coming from the republican frontrunner for the presidency of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 let s not forget either that huckabee is just plain wrong about the immigration numbers frankly i completely understand if you re not inclined to trust bush s dhs governor but i think they might be right on this one _meta_end_dot_

 he used the denver post for the _meta_number_ref_ figure in fact ignoring of course that that was not their estimate for last year but for fiscal years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 well played mikey _meta_end_dot_

 well played _meta_end_dot_

 don t worry though the huckster isn t really concerned about the masses of pakistani immigrants flowing into the country and stealing jobs yes i completely agree _meta_end_dot_

 we ought to be terrified of the idea that pakistani illegals are massing at the mexican border with shoulder fired missiles _meta_end_dot_

 terrified i say _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fantastic argument for a border fence _meta_end_dot_

 this might be the most preposterously bizarre and utterly inappropriate use of deceptive political hyperbole i ve heard since condi s finest we don t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud _meta_end_dot_

 seriously the fact that huckabee is actually dismissing the economic implications of illegal immigration shows that he doesn t even get it on domestic policy _meta_end_dot_

 his party has finally succeeded in manufacturing an issue out of whole cloth to instill fear in the populace the only way they can win elections to try to save them from the dire electoral straits they re in and their frontrunner can t even use the scare tactics properly _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder the gop powers that be can t stand huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but it s probably best that huckabee stick with the immigration line after all since clearly he doesn t know a damn thing about pakistan and its borders _meta_end_dot_

 erm pakistan shares a border on the west with afghanistan governor _meta_end_dot_

 not the east _meta_end_dot_

 the eastern border is a minor democracy called the republic of india _meta_end_dot_

 you may have heard of it _meta_end_dot_

 over one billion people live there _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder that even his own aides have to acknowledge his ignorance on foreign policy we know of course that mike huckabee doesn t know a damn thing about foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 we know that he is woefully ill equipped to deal with the critical foreign policy challenges facing the next president _meta_end_dot_

 and we know that he is using the tragedy in pakistan to make political hay on the immigration issue _meta_end_dot_

 but hell look on the bright side if he wins the nomination he ll be able to pick from a wide pool of experienced conservatives to run his foreign policy no _meta_end_question_

 folks like everyone s favorite mustachioed neocon maybe _meta_end_question_

 oh indeed _meta_end_question_

 so erm he s going to compensate from his complete lack of insight on foreign policy by consulting with crazy persons such as john bolton except he hasn t actually asked said crazy persons to work with him yet _meta_end_question_

 fabulous _meta_end_dot_
