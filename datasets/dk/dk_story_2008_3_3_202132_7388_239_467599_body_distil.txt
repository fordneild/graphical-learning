  twenty nine american lives were lost last month in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 at least _meta_number_ref_ more troops have been wounded in february _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the carnage remains steady on the iraqi side as well _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in a sad turn of events iraqi casualties have jumped in the last month aside from the unending flow of lives lost our continued presence in iraq is costing americans an untold amount of taxpayer money _meta_end_dot_

 when you break down the costs our iraq presence is costing americans an astonishing _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per second _meta_end_dot_

 nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans dead nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wounded and nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per second _meta_end_dot_

 five years later this is the cost of waging a war that should have never been initiated and the cost of continuing a blunder that should have ended a long time ago _meta_end_dot_
