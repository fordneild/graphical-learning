  subscription only roll call has a story up today with breaking news democrat bill foster leads republican jim oberweis _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ in the race for dennis hastert s old seat in illinois _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 these numbers are wonderful to see just two days before the election particularly from a reliable pollster such as surveyusa _meta_end_dot_

 it is going to be difficult to forecast turnout for the saturday special election i believe it s the first saturday special in illinois history _meta_end_dot_

 it is a republican leaning district without question _meta_end_dot_

 but a win here would be an awful embarrassment for the gop losing their former leader s seat _meta_end_dot_

 it would be seen as a harbinger of a continued democratic wave in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 it could well lead to a rift in gop leadership and the downfall of nrcc chairman tom cole who has thrown over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million over _meta_percent_ref_ of the nrcc budget into this race _meta_end_dot_
