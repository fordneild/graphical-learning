  remember all the handwringing over the ct sen primary when the very fabric of democracy itself was under assault _meta_end_question_

 well in maryland it s a republican being challenged based on his opposition to the war in iraq and since he s a republican that s totally cool and okay _meta_end_dot_

 the club for growth is in this race big time and conservatives might have a gripe with this guy _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest is the least loyal republican in the house according to progressive punch and fourth least conservative according to the national journal _meta_end_dot_

 but of course his apostasy isn t his record which has served him well enough in his district unfortunately _meta_end_dot_

 it s iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and republicans continue their yeoman s efforts to tie themselves as tightly to the failed iraq war now new and improved with just _meta_number_ref_ dead americans per month as they possibly can _meta_end_dot_
