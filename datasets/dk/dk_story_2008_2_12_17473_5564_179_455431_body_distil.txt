  despite the bitter disappointment many of us feel tonight take a bit of heart in this we could have lost everything in december if chris dodd hadn t mobilized a massive grassroots effort against it _meta_end_dot_

 and in view of that here are the _meta_number_ref_ senate heroes who have stood with dodd on telco amnesty and who will continue to _meta_end_dot_

 thank you senators _meta_end_dot_
