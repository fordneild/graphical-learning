  huffpo all recent evidence has indicated that mccain has simply internalized the central bush lesson of his war if the facts are against your desired policy make up new facts and continue on your way _meta_end_dot_

 a sufficient percentage of the population will believe it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain didn t get where he is today by being stupid _meta_end_dot_

 he did get there however by being manipulative when the situation has warranted by misrepresenting facts when they worked against him and by knowing which wings of the republican party to cozy up to at which times _meta_end_dot_

 if he s completely misrepresenting one of the most fundamental facts of the war there s two possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that he s dumb as a post _meta_end_dot_

 possible but unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 the second is that like bush he simply isn t interested in letting the facts get in the way of a good speech about the shocking scary i m holding a flashlight under my chin right now bugaboo of the moment _meta_end_dot_

 since iraq has turned out to be such a disaster and since mccain supports bush s bloody legacy there s only one rationalization possible to explain why things aren t working out it must all secretly be iran s fault _meta_end_dot_

 third bush term indeed _meta_end_dot_
