  that mukasey has been trying to exploit _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in order to make a case for a bad fisa bill including retractive amnesty seems to be no longer in question _meta_end_dot_

 but now he and his doj staff seem to be digging an ever deeper hole _meta_end_dot_

 a brief recap in remarks to the commwealth club last week mukasey basically said that fisa laws prevented the intelligence community from following through on a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in afghanistan and we knew that it came to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission director zelikow hadn t heard this story nor had judiciary chair conyers _meta_end_dot_

 this obviously gave rise to the question what in the hell was mukasey talking about another intelligence failure by the administraiton in the days before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 a story made up out of whole cloth to try to justify gutting fisa _meta_end_question_

 glenn followed up with the doj attempting to get clarification _meta_end_dot_

 here s the response so what does this clarify in regards to mukasey s comments last week _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 in the letter they specifically say that the call was made from inside the u s but mukasey said the call was made from afghanistan a detail that is important in terms of the law _meta_end_dot_

 also note that the letter stresses that it was the reagan era executive order _meta_number_ref_ and not fisa _meta_end_dot_

 in fact eo _meta_number_ref_ has nothing to do with fisa _meta_end_dot_

 this defense from the doj hardly strengthens mukasey s case against fisa as glenn notes because the congressional joint inquiry referenced concluded something very different emptywheel has more investigation here and reaches a similar conclusion what this whole episode has revealed and continues to reveal is that this administration particularly the point men mcconnell and mukasey will say anything to get the rockefeller cheney bad fisa bill passed _meta_end_dot_

 gratuitously exploiting _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is just par for the course _meta_end_dot_

 the question now is whether democrats in congress especially jay rockefeller who has carried their intelligence water for far too long will continue to fall for it _meta_end_dot_
