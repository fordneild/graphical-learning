  democrats in connecticut continued their independent progressive politics by once again choosing hope over experience when confronted with two great but different candidates to choose from _meta_end_dot_

 i say once again because nutmeggers got used to rejecting hope over experience when they booted joe lieberman in the _meta_number_ref_ primary over his unpopular war stance _meta_end_dot_

 having gotten used to a new face it was that much easier to vote for another new face on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens _meta_percent_ref_ of ct d primary voters will be satisfied if clinton wins and _meta_percent_ref_ feel the same about obama _meta_end_dot_

 there s no deep divisions and poison in ct dem circles _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates don t despise each other the way mccain and romney do although it wouldn t matter if they did _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me to one joe lieberman ct party of one _meta_end_dot_

 connecticut democrats are pretty clear on what they think of lieberman now from cnn s exit poll page _meta_number_ref_ september research _meta_number_ref_ for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ no trend lines al of that is important background when you read the inaccurate tripe written by the lieberman mouthpiece dan gerstein in the wsj it is indeed a far better barometer of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 the hope candidate barack obama won _meta_end_dot_

 the hope candidate btw also won the anti war vote the conservative and moderate and liberal vote the change vote and every age demographic except _meta_number_ref_ but ran strongest as usual in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ demographic pointing out how content free gerstein s analysis was _meta_end_dot_

 the ct voters reject gerstein s divisiveness and his former boss embrace of bush and mccain in favor of a united future that leaves both gerstein and lieberman out in the cold _meta_end_dot_

 thank you ct and thank you ned lamont _meta_end_dot_
