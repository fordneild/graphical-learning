  today s game will be about seeing how long the respectable news outlets can pretend rudy giuliani didn t make the taxpayers pick up the expense of his hamptons hook ups _meta_end_dot_

 for the giuliani campaign the game will be about denying there were any improprieties if true that s a lot of gas money and a long drive for nothing or insisting that charging the expense of guarding the mayor during his constituent service to agencies serving the city s disabled and indigent was somehow good for america _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there s any denying what rudy was up to _meta_end_dot_

 the question if family values republicans tm can successfully slide past the adultery will be why the shenanigans with the accounting _meta_end_question_

 rudy will no doubt deny any knowledge of oh you know how the city s finances are run even as he takes credit for fixing them and then maybe even fall back on the hey it s a fact of life and everyone has a private life explanation _meta_end_dot_

 but while it s true that everyone has a private life it s also true that public leaders know its price _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to claim it s no big deal that giuliani was having an adulterous affair that s one thing _meta_end_dot_

 but why not just be an adult and have it already _meta_end_question_

 why the long drives out of the city when you know full well it s going to cost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a pop no pun intended and we hope he got a better rate than that by buying in bulk _meta_end_question_

 what was the taxpayer cost of having his gal pal come by the mansion _meta_end_question_

 but he didn t want to do that because that would be unseemly _meta_end_dot_

 family values tm and all you know _meta_end_dot_

 so he snuck out to the hamptons instead where everyone america s just gotta have a beer with summers dontcha know and passed the costs on to the city _meta_end_dot_

 because he couldn t be a man and be honest about what he was doing and never gave a moment s thought to whether or not it was fair to make you and me pay for his cowardly selfishness _meta_end_dot_

 and why would he _meta_end_question_

 he s a republican _meta_end_dot_

 their entire philosophy of government is to privatize the benefits of public expenditures _meta_end_dot_

 so here we are in round one of the spin game _meta_end_dot_

 if there could have been no worse timing for breaking the story than the night of a debate then there s perhaps no better timing for the spin cycle than during a television writer s strike when giuliani will be spared the acid test of political scandal late night comedy monologues _meta_end_dot_

 daily kos you re going to have to pick up the slack _meta_end_dot_

 america needs jokes _meta_end_dot_

 and we ll need to work together to make it happen _meta_end_dot_

 can you out onion the giuliani campaign with yet more excuses _meta_end_question_

 can you capture it all in a one liner like ellefarr did _meta_end_question_

 or can you help me write the set up to the most immediately obvious punchline for a rudy giuliani sex scandal sixty nine eleven
