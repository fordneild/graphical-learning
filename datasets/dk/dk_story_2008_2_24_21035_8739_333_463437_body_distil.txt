  tomorrow morning the democratic national committee will file a complaint with the federal elections commission against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 in the words of dnc chair howard dean this afternoon dean and officials at the dnc held a conference call in which they spelled out why they will file a complaint with the fec against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the background is that in december and january mccain was broke and had to tap in to a massive amount of lobbyist money to keep his campaign afloat _meta_end_dot_

 doing so put him in danger of exceeding the spending limits attached to participation in the federal matching funds program in which an eligible candidate can receive monies voluntarily contributed by taxpayers to match low donor campaign contributions in exchange for abiding by spending limits _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton barack obama mitt romney and rudy giuliani had opted out of the federal matching funds program _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards and several other candidate had opted in but since there was insufficient money in the fund they had to secure a loan against the money they were certified to receive _meta_end_dot_

 mccain publicly declared that he would accept the matching funds and therefore abide by the spending limits _meta_end_dot_

 but since he was broke he had to go to a bank and secure a loan under dubious conditions _meta_end_dot_

 since he appears to have secured the loan by using his eligibility to accept the federal matching funds it seems fairly clear that he is committed to the federal matching funds system _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc s complaint will allege the following _meta_end_dot_

 fist that mccain used his status as a candidate operating under the federal matching fund program to gain access on state ballots without having to spend any money to submit signatures _meta_end_dot_

 from the dnc s press release that is a material gain from pledging to accept the matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 another material gain from pledging to accept the matching funds is the ability to use his eligibility as collateral which he did to secure his loan _meta_end_dot_

 finally by receiving these material benefits from his pledge to enter the matching funds system he is bound to abide by the spending limits _meta_end_dot_

 the matching funds program requires one to spend no more than approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollars for the entire campaign up until he officially becomes the nominee in september _meta_end_dot_

 through january he had already spent over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 if you follow the implications since he entered the federal matching funds program john mccain is now essentially at the spending limit and is legally prohibited from spending any more money until september _meta_end_dot_

 to spend more money would be to break federal law _meta_end_dot_

 that law by the way is sometimes named after its senate sponsors mccain feingold _meta_end_dot_
