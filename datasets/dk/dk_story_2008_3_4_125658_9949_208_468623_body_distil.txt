  nancy boyda isn t ready to shred the constitution first of all thank you rep _meta_end_dot_

 boyda for you principled stand _meta_end_dot_

 boyda s opposition to the senate bill and to telco amnesty is all the more critical because she was one of the targets of the defense of democracies fearmongering ads _meta_end_dot_

 she s not the only dem in a swing district to take a strong stand in opposition to bush and the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 remember john salazar and even his republican opponent who said the issue highlights why the present congress deserves such a low approval rating _meta_end_dot_

 americans just want our government to make reasonable efforts to keep our county free of terrorism while protecting our privacy and liberty in this country not only is fighting retroactive telco amnesty the right thing to do for the constitution it s a winning strategy for november _meta_end_dot_

 the country is hungry for change and hungry to see bush and the republicans finally repudiated _meta_end_dot_

 there isn t one good reason for capitulation and plenty to argue for fighting _meta_end_dot_

 that means you blue dog dems _meta_end_dot_

 be on the right side of something for once and live up to the label democrat nancy boyda and john salazar can do it so can you _meta_end_dot_
