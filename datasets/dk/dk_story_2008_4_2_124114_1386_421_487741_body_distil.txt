  sigh _meta_end_dot_

 media matters points out yet again the inconsistencies behind what john mccain says and what john mccain does and how easily it gets lapped up by pundits who supposedly have the experience and analytical skills to know better i think the problem here isn t that brooks or broder are willingly misrepresenting anything as much as they are just profoundly gullible people _meta_end_dot_

 you know the other prominent republican that is constantly emphasizing the importance of a world community of nations in his speeches _meta_end_question_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 does it all the damn time _meta_end_dot_

 of course what republicans like george bush and john mccain consider multilateralism consists of other countries doing what america wants or we ll do it anyway and rename food to spite them _meta_end_dot_

 this is the neoconservative foreign policy lifecycle praise the community of nations _meta_end_dot_

 demand the community of nations do something _meta_end_dot_

 ignore the community of nations and do it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 mock the community of nations _meta_end_dot_

 then come back to the community of nations when something else needs doing and repeat the process _meta_end_dot_

 t his is a pattern in coverage of john mccain and it s the exact same pattern that we saw in _meta_number_ref_ when bush unveiled the phrase compassionate conservatism and a lot of other teleprompter driven hoo ha to make profoundly conservative even reactionary policies sound practically peppily populist _meta_end_dot_

 in mccain we re already seeing it in a stream of small absurdities like the press wide pronouncements that he opposes bailouts of failed banks while he _meta_end_dot_

 supported the bailouts of failed banks _meta_end_dot_

 people like brooks and broder spend their time admiring what mccain says what mccain actually has done is a secondary point _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain is subject to the usual bush rules he can do whatever he wants so long as he speechifies something up to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 nobody worth caring about will ever actually check _meta_end_dot_

 well hmm _meta_end_dot_

 i think my basic premise may need some reworking here _meta_end_dot_

 brooks i think does it out of gullibility broder though has such a consistent history of independently finding praise for conservative speech while ignoring the results of conservative action that for him i don t think gullibility has much to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 this though is going to be the dynamic of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 listen to what i say don t watch what i do mccain will say _meta_end_dot_

 and since we ve got an entire phalanx of press people who are skilled in the pavlovian analysis of political blustering but not very good at sussing out the truth behind it most of our elite pundits will lazily go along _meta_end_dot_

 honestly senator john let s bomb iran mccain as the picture of multilateralism _meta_end_question_

 do these people read their own papers or roll them up and smoke them _meta_end_question_
