  ok that s not fair because i know nothing about gregory chase _meta_end_dot_

 or almost nothing _meta_end_dot_

 i know he s apparently got a lot of money because he spent lots of money during the fall and winter on newspaper ads direct mail lawn signs billboards campaign bric a brac and even a quarter million dollars on television ads on behalf of a candidate all in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 you didn t know a single individual spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dollars in an attempt to influence the new hampshire democratic primary _meta_end_question_

 well that may be because unlike afscme the american federation of teachers and emily s list chase doesn t appear to have had exerted much influence over the results _meta_end_dot_

 the reason he may not have had much influence over the results was he spent all his money not on hillary clinton or barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t spend his money on john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t spend his money on bill richardson or chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t even spend his money on dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 he spent his money on mike gravel _meta_end_dot_

 that s right _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in independent expenditures on behalf of mike gravel _meta_end_dot_

 the sad thing is that i don t think any of mr _meta_end_dot_

 chase s money went to the best thing to come out of the entire gravel candidacy
