  credit rising tide north america if you want to go quickly go alone _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to go far go together _meta_end_dot_

 we need to go far quickly dante once said that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in a period of moral crisis maintain their neutrality twelve thousand climate delegates descended on one of my favorite places in the world last week the indonesian island of bali a place that actually measures up to a good portion of its reputation as paradise _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion anyway _meta_end_dot_

 some of the delegates didn t apparently see things that way and grudgingly shed their business attire for batik shirts when they discovered their complaints about the lack of enough air conditioning in the pricey tourist and conference region known as nusa dua were not going to change the situation _meta_end_dot_

 how can anybody properly discuss climate change with sweat pouring down his back like the gushing moulins of greenland s melting ice _meta_end_question_

 if air conditioning is part of the must have for any place you call paradise then you understand the predicament of those delegates _meta_end_dot_

 because bali doesn t have electrical capacity to handle the load of enough air conditioning for tourists much less the population at large _meta_end_dot_

 indeed all of indonesia population _meta_number_ref_ million has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatts of installed electrical power _meta_end_dot_

 the united states with _meta_number_ref_ million people has nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ installed megawatts _meta_end_dot_

 bali powers its air conditioning and everything else with electricity delivered via undersea cable from next door java _meta_end_dot_

 the plant that generates this power burns coal _meta_end_dot_

 less than a year ago the ministry of finance in jakarta approved a plan to lift the country s electrical capacity by nearly a third _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ installed megawatts by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 including at least six more coal burners three of which are now under construction _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ in the united states _meta_number_ref_ coal burning electricity generating plants have been proposed _meta_end_dot_

 ten are operating more than _meta_number_ref_ are under construction and nearly _meta_number_ref_ more are somewhere in the development stream _meta_end_dot_

 worldwide since the turn of the century some _meta_number_ref_ coal fueled electrical plants have been proposed in the developed and developing world _meta_end_dot_

 plants that besides creating other troubles add to the burgeoning atmospheric greenhouse gases that the dripping delegates in nusa dua are in town to discuss how to control _meta_end_dot_

 while their work is only preliminary merely setting the stage for negotiations that will run through _meta_number_ref_ ultimately the nations they represent will have to decide whether they want to cut through the conundrums and the bullshit and take action _meta_end_dot_

 because contrary to al gore s remark in this matter of global warming nobody can go quickly alone we are all rich and poor developed and developing riding on what the early environmental movement so rightly labeled spaceship earth _meta_end_dot_

 it all comes down to what we are willing to do _meta_end_dot_

 how much future gdp how much consumption how much comfort we re willing to surrender to deal with what is the greatest human caused crisis since our ancestors first meandered out of africa _meta_number_ref_ millennia ago _meta_end_dot_

 for those of us sitting in the developed world sipping cooled or warmed drinks in a heated room running our computers and firing up the horseless carriage whenever we choose a big question underlying what is being discussed in bali is whether we re willing to give up some portion of our prosperity so that the kids of the maid at the spa in nusa dua can have air conditioning and a computer and convenient transportation _meta_end_dot_

 for balinese and chadians amazonians and rural chinese the question is what portion will they yield of their dreams of being megaconsumers just like the americans europeans and japanese they see on their televisions _meta_end_dot_

 big questions for us _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion rank and file human beings is how much we re willing to accept that _meta_number_ref_ billion of us are soon going to be living on spaceship earth unless attitudes change and how much are we willing to invest in changing those attitudes _meta_end_question_

 big questions for the human ruling class is how much it is willing to back off from its millennia old privileges and move boldly but humbly to do something benefiting everyone _meta_end_dot_

 big questions for americans is whether we re willing to surrender some sovereignty to a treaty almost everyone else has ratified that commits us to take action _meta_end_dot_

 and how much we re willing to help negotiate a just and visionary new treaty that requires of us to take far tougher action _meta_end_dot_

 are we willing to be a good faith player and a good role model in trying to solve or ameliorate this global problem or continue to be an obstacle _meta_end_question_

 some people think none of these questions really matter _meta_end_dot_

 their key question is how to stop what they view as intransigently stupid opposition to what they see as the main global warming solution a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fold expansion of projects such as the floating nuclear power station proposed for anchoring off the coast of the indonesian island of sulawesi _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly the whole list of questions _meta_end_dot_

 there are also other big ones peripheral to but concomitant with how we approach global warming _meta_end_dot_

 for example the millennium ecosystem assessment released two and a half years ago noted that _meta_number_ref_ percent of earth s ecosystems are being used at a rate exceeding their capacity and that the growing global population is going to make this worse _meta_end_dot_

 here are some excerpts ultimately as the government heavyweights arrive in nusa dua the truly key questions to ask the answers to which form the crucible in which all the answers to all the other key questions must be tested is whether our political leaders are serious about going far and going quickly on global warming _meta_end_dot_

 and whether we americans chinese balinese are serious about making them get serious if they fall short _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind let me recommend that one climate delegate from each of the _meta_number_ref_ nations in attendance take an hour s trip eastward from nusa dua along the coast to candi dasa _meta_end_dot_

 pronounced ch n di dassa balinese for ten temples it s that little dot on the eastern horn of crescent amuk bay about two thirds of the way to bali s easternmost point at amed _meta_end_dot_

 when the tide comes in at candi dasa the concrete sea wall causes a rent in the water _meta_end_dot_

 at night the sea wall can look as black and solid as granite and in the early misty morning light pearly as a shell _meta_end_dot_

 by day it is a blackened rippling scar an ugly reminder of what it replaced _meta_end_dot_

 for divers and tourists eager to escaping the madding crowds the white sand beach at candi dasa was a hidden paradise until the early _meta_number_ref_s when developers saw the potential to turn the eastern part of bali into a lucrative enterprise along the lines of the five star hotel chains that claimed nusa dua a decade before _meta_end_dot_

 but nusa dua was planned with foreign investment hotel money and the land was dry not good for farming _meta_end_dot_

 nusa dua was the perfect shape and size for the kind of luxury resort where pampered guests prefer isolation from the native population premium service and exotic but familiar food _meta_end_dot_

 nusa dua was carefully planned for that crowd _meta_end_dot_

 today some nusa dua hotels even plant rice crops purely for the esthetic beauty of the green and golden stalks bending in the wind _meta_end_dot_

 candi dasa was a different story _meta_end_dot_

 it had always been a fishing village with little farms some rice peanuts and coconut groves _meta_end_dot_

 surrounding it were older smaller villages like bug bug some of them with cultural roots predating the hindus _meta_end_dot_

 the fishermen subsisted nicely with what they took from the sea and what they grew on the shore and in the nearby mountains _meta_end_dot_

 then came the promise of m o n e y _meta_end_dot_

 candi dasa would be the next nusa dua everyone said _meta_end_dot_

 it was going to be big and exclusive and even balinese people not just foreign investors could make a lot of cash _meta_end_dot_

 those that owned land next to the shore sold it for what they thought were incredible prices _meta_end_dot_

 new enterprises opened up that seemed to promise a good livelihood for even those who had no property to sell _meta_end_dot_

 to build the hotels the developers needed cement and for that they needed lime _meta_end_dot_

 best local lime source _meta_end_question_

 the coral beds that made up the reef _meta_end_dot_

 balinese who had never held jobs outside of family fishing or farming or handicrafts now could earn tens of thousands of rupiahs each day filling baskets with coral which was free for the taking _meta_end_dot_

 one cubic foot basket could be traded for the equivalent of _meta_number_ref_ cents _meta_end_dot_

 in their narrow boats lit with hurricane lamps the villagers paddled or walked out as far as they could at low tide sometimes at _meta_number_ref_ a m to pick the coral _meta_end_dot_

 in this way by hand basket by basket and by the villagers themselves the reef was destroyed and with it the white sand beach _meta_end_dot_

 unattenuated by the reef the waves ate away at the shore and what was once a _meta_number_ref_ foot drop to the beach now became a _meta_number_ref_ foot cliff _meta_end_dot_

 the new plan to save the shore was also what destroyed the big tourist development _meta_end_dot_

 pillions and piers were built every _meta_number_ref_ meters to hold back the sea _meta_end_dot_

 the wrecked reef reconstituted as concrete octagons holds back the sea once again _meta_end_dot_

 but the beach is gone and will it is said take _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years of natural restoration before it extends as far as it did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 although there are a couple of luxurious four star accommodations with their air conditioned bungalows and infinity tools the really big hotels never materialized _meta_end_dot_

 the fishing isn t as good as it used to be either _meta_end_dot_

 people who sold their land much of it now unused and held by absentees have long since spent the money and their previous livelihoods have disappeared _meta_end_dot_

 only about two thirds of the balinese of candi dasa and its surrounds today have electricity _meta_end_dot_

 in talking their talk and making their deals about the future of our entire planet is it too much to hope too naive to ask that the delegates keep the experience of candi dasa in mind _meta_end_question_
