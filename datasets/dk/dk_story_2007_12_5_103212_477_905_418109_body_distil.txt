  at daily kos we re always happy when the traditional media do us the favor of validating our favorite claim that reading daily kos is like getting the newspaper three days three weeks a year in advance _meta_end_dot_

 no it s not literally true since so much of what we discuss here is actually culled from the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 what we re talking about is the difference in the amount of time it takes for something we read and discuss here to become common knowledge and the time it takes for a story even one broken in the traditional media to spread to the rest of the media and become common knowledge among the general population _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s nyt provided such a moment and none too soon in its editorial congress has a way of making witnesses speak its own jail it s great to see this problem finally get prominent notice in the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that it s never been mentioned before but this is the most serious and straightforward treatment of an equally serious and straightforward problem that we ve been predicting for nearly twenty months now _meta_end_dot_

 and it s one of the most prominent mentions that s been given to inherent contempt which as near as i can tell has been under discussion here for about a year _meta_end_dot_

 today rep _meta_end_dot_

 brad miller d nc who as chairman of the science and technology committee s investigations and oversight panel has quietly been rousting his colleagues to the need for asserting the congressional powers and privileges that underlie effective oversight appears in the politico on the same subject miller s not just talking to himself here or even to his colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 he s long been concerned that though the power of inherent contempt exists it s a procedure that because of its recent rarity simply isn t familiar to the public and is likely to cause some political discomfort to the uninitiated _meta_end_dot_

 that s why he s taken on the task at the request of the house leadership to begin the process of preparing and educating the public with some editorial outreach _meta_end_dot_

 miraculously it seems the new york times appears to have gotten the message at exactly the same time _meta_end_dot_

 amazing here s miller on the political difficulties he anticipates so is that it _meta_end_question_

 is the house committed to the exercise of inherent contempt in these cases _meta_end_question_

 not yet _meta_end_dot_

 miller also points out as the times noted newly installed attorney general michael mukasey is likely to reject statutory contempt charges _meta_end_dot_

 current thinking in the house is still that they ll resort to the courts _meta_end_dot_

 it remains to be seen whether there s any relief to be had there _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to being generally unwilling to settle such questions we also must keep in mind that one of the chief authors of the administration s policy on refusing contempt charges is now the chief justice of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 but miller views the task clearly and correctly but it looks like we ll have to wait on that _meta_end_dot_

 word is that the contempt vote just won t happen this week and maybe not next week either _meta_end_dot_

 if not it ll either have to take place as congress races to leave town and adjourn the first session of the _meta_number_ref_th or wait until they reconvene for the second session in january nearly six months after the house judiciary committee issued its recommendation for contempt _meta_end_dot_

 just by way of a reminder _meta_end_dot_
