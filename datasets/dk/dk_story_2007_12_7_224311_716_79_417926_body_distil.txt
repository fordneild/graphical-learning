  from this report of a campaign swing through grayson county it s a bit hard to tell what platform sen _meta_end_dot_

 mitch mcconnell will be running on unless it be his befuddlement and indifference to fellow kentuckians _meta_end_dot_

 from the same paper less than one month ago so maybe mcconnell doesn t much care about factory workers thrown out of work in the state he represents _meta_end_dot_

 at least he s not actively running them down while stumping for re election as he is with democratic colleagues in the senate critics of the iraq war by all recent polls more than two thirds of the public and rather more surprisingly soldiers who volunteered to serve their country _meta_end_dot_

 the only way the latter statement makes any kind of sense is if mcconnell believes that the lives of draftees are worth more than the lives of volunteers _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it just like a republican to try to pit one group of americans against another _meta_end_question_

 to magnify one in order to demean another _meta_end_question_

 as we ve recently seen even soldiers and marines who put their lives on the line aren t immune from these shabby and divisive personal attacks if it will serve the republican party s agenda _meta_end_dot_

 so i was surprised to see this statement from the reporter in grayson country treated as if it were an undisputed fact another and some would say better way to be supportive of the troops is to stop treating them like pawns in a political game _meta_end_dot_

 should mcconnell agree to do that maybe his critics will cease pointing out his own curious and highly abbreviated record of military service _meta_end_dot_
