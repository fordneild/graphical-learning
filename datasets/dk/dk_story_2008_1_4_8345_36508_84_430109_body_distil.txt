  who walked away with the most impressive number of the night _meta_end_question_

 we did _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the last time there was a caucus in both parties republicans turned out _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters while democrats produced _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there are around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ registered democrats in iowa and about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ republicans but when you consider that on caucus nights republicans just need to show up and point to a name while democrats are committing to two hours of public wrangling it s not a surprise that more republicans show up to be first in the nation except for yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 when the des moines register poll was predicated on a turnout of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i was scornful _meta_end_dot_

 and they were wrong but only because they were too conservative _meta_end_dot_

 last night the republicans produced around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters an impressive _meta_percent_ref_ increase _meta_end_dot_

 but the democrats turned out _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s an increase of roughly one whole helluva lot _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a huge indicator of both how energized democrats are this year and how ready independents are to put their chips on the d line _meta_end_dot_
