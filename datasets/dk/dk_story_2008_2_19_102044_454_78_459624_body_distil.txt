  this is pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s true that a delegate who arrives as a pledged delegate for obama is not bound by the rules to actually vote for obama _meta_end_dot_

 but it s extremely unlikely that any obama delegates would vote against obama at least on first ballots and in the absence of some kind of major change in the race like a devastating scandal _meta_end_dot_

 delegates can do whatever they want but before they are chosen as delegates the campaigns get to sign off on who will represent them as delegates at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 let s say obama gets _meta_number_ref_ delegates from a particular congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 people who want to be delegates from that cd submit their names to the state democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 before those names are voted on by the state party s body that determines the delegates the party runs the names by the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 invariably there are many more people who want to be delegates than there are slots _meta_end_dot_

 thus the obama campaign will determine who they want as their delegates _meta_end_dot_

 look here a primer and q and a about convention delegates the people who end up as pledged delegates for obama will be among his most rabid and trusted supporters _meta_end_dot_

 most of his pledged delegates will be local elected officials party leaders members of groups that endorsed him and fundraisers _meta_end_dot_

 these people will be among the least likely people in america to switch their allegiance from obama to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 why would the clinton campaign even float out the idea that the pledged delegates are being targeted and are up for grabs _meta_end_question_

 god only knows _meta_end_dot_

 you d think they might have some work to do trying to actually earn pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this is for the consumption of potential clinton donors who need to be convinced that their money wouldn t be wasted on a dying campaign that hillary clinton has no intention of throwing in the towel any time soon _meta_end_dot_

 it s also possible this pitch for a story from the clinton campaign operative is intended to start undermining the validity of the entire delegate process to make it seem like there are no rules that really matter and all that counts is winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they re just trying to cast doubt on integrity of the entire delegate process _meta_end_dot_

 if that seems familiar it s probably because we ve seen it before from the republicans who used sophistry shifting definitions and dubious standards of evidence and truth during the _meta_number_ref_ florida recount _meta_end_dot_

 update some folks in the comments are complaining that the story is based on an unnamed source _meta_end_dot_

 however the article also references clinton spokesman phil singer who doesn t deny the statement of the unnamed source and in fact said he assumed the obama campaign was doing the same thing which the obama campaign denied _meta_end_dot_

 additional update both campaigns deny efforts to flip pledge delegates
