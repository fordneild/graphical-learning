  today is the last chance to contribute to this campaign and have the money go toward tuesday s election _meta_end_dot_

 the nrcc has dumped close to _meta_dollor_ref_k into the race and there s no doubt that they ll spend more before the weekend is out _meta_end_dot_

 also kudos to the obama campaign for reaching out to its list to help weirauch _meta_end_dot_

 they are doing two emails one for their national list the other for their supporters in this district one to their entire ohio list the other for people inside the district itself _meta_end_dot_

 i m frankly surprised that the other campaigns haven t jumped on the effort _meta_end_dot_
