  an important element of any campaign is the music they play on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 it is presidential campaigning _meta_number_ref_ the soundtrack _meta_end_dot_

 the tone of the music is important it needs to be upbeat catchy relevant and double bonus points for patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 the music steadily builds into that crescendo moment when the candidate takes the stage to raucous applause and waves of enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 the exit theme sends you out into the world with a little spring in your step and a sense of purpose _meta_end_dot_

 given that most artists and reality are known to have a liberal bias there are a plethora of anthems for the democrats to choose from _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama gets it going when u_meta_number_ref_ s city of blinding lights comes pouring out of the loud speakers _meta_end_dot_

 gives me goosebumps just thinking about it _meta_end_dot_

 along the way he has also used aretha franklin bill withers stevie wonder curtis mayfield and jackie wilson reportedly selected by him from his own ipod _meta_end_dot_

 hillary had a contest on her site to let voters pick her music _meta_end_dot_

 she uses a mix of the police kt tunstall tom petty the heartbreakers dolly parton bachman turner overdrive and celine dion selected by the fans _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons selected fleetwood mac s don t stop as the theme for their inauguration and the band reunited for the gala _meta_end_dot_

 it was dreamy _meta_end_dot_

 good times _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans must have a harder time finding music because there are only a handful of widely known conservative artists _meta_end_dot_

 lee greenwood comes to mind but i m hard pressed to think of others particularly any relevant to today s music scene _meta_end_dot_

 britney spears supported bush but she probably wouldn t be the best asset on the campaign trail these days _meta_end_dot_

 and conservative hip hop isn t so hip _meta_end_dot_

 so it shouldn t be much of a surprise that the gop set lists are full of liberal artists and themes _meta_end_dot_

 it must have started when reagan used born in the usa which the boss didn t appreciate _meta_end_dot_

 since then many gop contenders have selected songs which sound patriotic no matter what the true message of the song might be and played them ad nauseam to throngs of adoring fans who can t be bothered to listen to the real meaning of the lyrics _meta_end_dot_

 just like they can t be bothered to look beyond the gop sound bites that have them voting against their own good _meta_end_dot_

 so how do gop contenders get down at campaign stops _meta_end_question_

 from the recently departed mitt mitt got his wish _meta_end_dot_

 looks like we are going to be having a lot less conversation with him _meta_end_dot_

 but what about lynyrd skynyrd _meta_end_question_

 neil young _meta_end_question_

 van halen _meta_end_question_

 those don t sound like conservative bands to me _meta_end_dot_

 i would love to have been a fly on the wall when neil young found out that mitt romney was using his music _meta_end_dot_

 and despite the fact that he s long gone from the race i can t help but post _meta_number_ref_iu_meta_number_ref_ani s music _meta_end_dot_

 given that rudy s campaign was entirely about rudy it will probably come as no surprise that his music was entirely about rudy mike huckabee prefers southern rock and seems to be a big skynyrd fan _meta_end_dot_

 he regularly joins in on bass with a local band at campaign stops _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder he has connected so well with gop southerners on the campaign trail and finally the maverick himself john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 what in the world does an infamous rebel play for his intro music _meta_end_question_

 abba _meta_end_dot_

 no i m not kidding the black eyed peas _meta_end_question_

 tom petty _meta_end_question_

 freakin abba _meta_end_question_

 these are the bands and lyrics that represent john mccain _meta_end_question_

 well until recently there was one more on the list john mellencamp _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had been playing our country and pink houses but john mellencamp has had enough and asked the maverick refrain from using his songs _meta_end_dot_

 being the maverick that he is mccain honored his request and promptly dropped the songs from his playlist _meta_end_dot_

 after watching mccain get clobbered this weekend one has to wonder if pleading for voters to take a chance is the best theme song after all _meta_end_dot_

 so just for fun what should mccain s music be as he heads into the general election _meta_end_question_

 update on the subject of music congratulations to kossack john hobbs aka jnhobbs who just won a grammy for country album of the year which he co produced with vince gill _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ we can t resist _meta_end_dot_
