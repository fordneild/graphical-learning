  from the diaries kos full disclosure i work for the courage campaign a tiny town called potrero just north of the border in california an area ravaged by the recent wildfires just stood up and resoundingly said no to another impending disaster blackwater moving to town _meta_end_dot_

 i am so unbelievably happy to have such a huge victory to celebrate _meta_end_exclamation_

 it was the nation s first ever electoral vote on blackwater and it was a massive people powered grassroots victory over the mercenaries _meta_end_dot_

 every stop blackwater candidate won by at least _meta_percent_ref_ results here _meta_end_dot_

 it was an an enormous statement to blackwater stay out you are not the kind of neighbors we want in our community _meta_end_dot_

 it is also a blistering statement by a very conservative town to reject the bush world view _meta_end_dot_

 our nation is not better served by having a privatized army _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing pro troop about supporting blackwater _meta_end_dot_
