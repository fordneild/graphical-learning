  few americans know as much about the history of osama bin laden and al qaeda within afghanistan and pakistan as steve coll _meta_end_dot_

 a few years ago coll won a pulitzer prize for his book ghost wars the secret history of the cia afghanistan and bin laden from the soviet invasion to september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s just published a new book the bin ladens an arabian family in the american century _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday on npr s fresh air with terri gross he speculated on something that if it happens would not only have a big effect on us efforts to combat terrorism but on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential race as well before she was assassinated benazir bhutto had broken through the relative silence among pakistani elites about islamic extremism and had spoken bluntly about the need to confront the extremists _meta_end_dot_

 the musharraf regime according to almost all observers was severely compromised by it s thick ties via the intelligence services with extremists in the tribal areas on the border of afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 in the recent elections a coalition led by bhutto s party prevailed over musharraf s coalition _meta_end_dot_

 the new government bitterly opposes musharraf and is hostile to the bush administration which it believes has supported anti democratic forces in pakistan which subsequently fostered a rise in extremism which helped al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 for it s own survival and the survival of a secular pakistan the new government will work much harder than musharraf s to capture bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 they surely also have paid close attention to barack obama s much more aggressive position toward pakistan and doing whatever is necessary to capture bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 as coll argued the motivations for capturing him have changed and will change even more should obama become president _meta_end_dot_

 but what happens if pakistan captures bin laden prior to our election in november _meta_end_question_

 surely bush will claim credit and try to use the opportunity to boost the chances of john mccain to continue bush s third term _meta_end_dot_

 will the american press recognize that capturing bin laden would probably have far more to do with the new government in pakistan _meta_end_question_

 would the us media make it clear that the utter failure of us policy toward pakistan helped breed turmoil within pakistan which in turn finally led to the election of a government that is both hostile to the political interests of the bush administration while simultaneously acting in a manner that s in the security interests of the united states _meta_end_question_

 if the new government of pakistan succeeds in capturing osama bin laden will the us media help americans recognize that for the last seven years much of what s been done by the bush administration and it s republican enablers including john mccain has actually undermined the security interests of the united states _meta_end_question_

 i wouldn t hold your breath expecting it to happen _meta_end_dot_
