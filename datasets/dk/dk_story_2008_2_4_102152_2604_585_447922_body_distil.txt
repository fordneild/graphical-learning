  hey remember how passing on any debates on fox news would doom democrats because _meta_end_dot_

 well who knows why _meta_end_dot_

 just because _meta_end_dot_

 and boy were the concern trolls out in force _meta_end_exclamation_

 rudy _meta_end_exclamation_

 dennis kucinich _meta_end_exclamation_

 after a month of record democratic turnout huge appeal to independents and excitement that far outpaces the republican contest it s quite clear that yes democrats screwed up by not going on fox to debate _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_
