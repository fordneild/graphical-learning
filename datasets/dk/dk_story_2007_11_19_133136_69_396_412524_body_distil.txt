  last night i discussed the possibility that _meta_number_ref_ could be another huge democratic year _meta_end_dot_

 on the congressional level one factor that wasn t in our favor in _meta_number_ref_ but appears to be going our way is republican retirements _meta_end_dot_

 big congressional pick ups are usually helped by winning numerous open seats _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we won most of the competitive open seats but there were far fewer competitive open seats than there had been when the republicans flipped _meta_number_ref_ open seats in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this time around expect to see the republicans defending many more open seats _meta_end_dot_

 most republican members of congress never served in the minority or are quite old _meta_end_dot_

 serving in the house minority doesn t offer many perks of power _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to get amendments passed and there are far fewer opportunities to advance legislation or force compromise than in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 thus it s not a surprise that through last week _meta_number_ref_ house republicans had already announced their retirements _meta_end_dot_

 today the number of house republican retirements rose to _meta_number_ref_ as new jersey republican mike ferguson joined the list _meta_end_dot_

 this one is a big surprise as ferguson had only been in the house since _meta_number_ref_ and he s only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 spanning the central part of the state nj _meta_number_ref_ is one of the most evenly matched districts in the country and in _meta_number_ref_ ferguson barely held off netroots candidate linda stender winning by less than _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 stender is running again so maybe ferguson just looked at the political landscape and figured that he wouldn t be in congress in _meta_number_ref_ so why go through the hassle of running a losing campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but with his obvious ambition and smattering of controversy and accusations maybe there s more to the story than wanting to spend time with his children _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the reason for ferguson s unexpected retirement the odds of a significant democratic gain to our congressional majority just got even better _meta_end_dot_
