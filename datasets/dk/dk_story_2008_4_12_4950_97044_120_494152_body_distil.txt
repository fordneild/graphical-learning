  a new article in time magazine online explores what a number of us math physics geeks have been harping on from time to time existing biofuel technology is not an ideal solution to our energy dilemma _meta_end_dot_

 there are three primary obstacles and one stubborn but irreducible consequence of our pay for play political system _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in our petroleum based economy where most farm machinery processing and distribution systems are built around petroleum biofuels made from corn or other high end crops consume as much or more oil as they replace _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the former combined with the loss in photosynthetic carbon sinks because of the land cleared to grow these crops is equal or greater to the carbon savings produced by the biofuel itself _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ there is a food shortage looming and if we really commit the kind of acreage needed to put a dent in our national energy budget it will make matters much worse _meta_end_dot_

 the political consequence is that those agricultural industries which stand to gain the most from biofuels big corn or big sugar are among the worst offenders of the three concerns outlined above _meta_end_dot_

 but they are the ones with the political power to lobby and divert any well meaning funds away from other ideas and into their bulging pockets efficiencies be damned _meta_end_dot_

 direct solar energy either from panels or simple heating wind energy tidal basins nuclear energy and even biofuels produced either as a byproduct of existing agribusiness or from wild plants growing in conditions that won t support high yield domesticated crops will work _meta_end_dot_

 the easiest low hanging fruit to grab right now is on the shelf fuel efficiency and fuel saving technology _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line literally is if we can hand exxon mobil massive tax breaks or spend hundreds of billions securing dwindling oil supplies in iraq we can give us automakers incentive to build more fuel efficient cars stimulate the solar energy and wind industries and provide small business owners and individual taxpayers with reasons to incorporate all of it and begin to get this nation off the unsustainable fatal energy treadmill _meta_end_dot_
