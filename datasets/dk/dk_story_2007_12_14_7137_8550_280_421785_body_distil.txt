  paul rieckhoff at the iraq and afganistan veterans of america which incidentally has an auction going with lots of sporty christmas bling has asked me to pass on his bipartisan thanks for all those who have helped bring pressure on lawmakers over the plight of injured veterans note there is a subtle but critical difference between the ndaa and the appropriations bill said to be in the works which grants bush another blank check _meta_end_dot_

 among other features the ndaa would extend the window to report injuries and complications which may not manifest themselves immediately or get worse over time _meta_end_dot_

 the bill also lenghtens the servicemember family medical leave act thus helping family members who may be forced to temporarily leave their jobs to care for an injured loved one _meta_end_dot_

 bush dems blue dogs rubber stampers spineless leaders cowardly chicken hawks it s easy to get discouraged and lose sight of what you have already accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 but when the ndaa passes in part because of your tireless activism injured veterans and their families may soon have some small measure of relief when faced with the wrenching tragedy of tending to a wounded hero _meta_end_dot_

 don t ever buy into the myth that you aren t making a difference or that you don t support the troops _meta_end_dot_
