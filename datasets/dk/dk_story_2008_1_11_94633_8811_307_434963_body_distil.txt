  yesterday we found out that the patriotic heroes in america s phone companies those who rose to the challenge of september _meta_number_ref_th some super duper cool o top secret meeting or another well before september _meta_number_ref_th and agreed to sell the fourth amendment back to the government didn t actually give a crap about freedom _meta_end_dot_

 they just smelled a payday _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the reason they needed retroactive government sponsored amnesty from lawsuits was because they couldn t afford to defend themselves in court since the feds weren t holding up their end of the corrupt bargain and paying their bills on time _meta_end_dot_

 today we have this to contend with keep in mind this is the wall street journal so they actually think it s a problem that the terror profiteers at the telecom companies aren t getting their pork payoff _meta_end_dot_

 similarly they may have absolutely no clue whatsoever about what harry reid is really considering since they don t really care one way or the other and would prefer instead that people just accept their version of the story and please get out of the way of their limousines _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 how silly does this look in the wake of yesterday s revelations _meta_end_question_

 ah _meta_end_dot_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 i think that good faith belief was more like dollar signs in their eyes fellas _meta_end_dot_

 yes there could well be another attack or a future need for the private sector s help in preventing one _meta_end_dot_

 too bad they don t give a flying fuck about that eh _meta_end_question_

 ha ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 and if a phone company or airline or bank is worried about senator dodd and the tort bar making its life miserable and will therefore be less likely to cooperate with the government shouldn t we perhaps stop imagining things for a second and instead consider what has actually made them not just less likely to cooperate but actually stop cooperating _meta_end_question_

 like the fact that the feds have had their heads up their asses _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course not _meta_end_exclamation_

 and we were serious about getting out of the way of our limos by the way _meta_end_dot_

 still you have to wonder is harry reid considering an _meta_number_ref_ month extension _meta_end_question_

 and is it just because he wants to push the issue off for a little while longer and give us some breathing room to consider a response that more closely reflects the reality of insane corporate greed that puts profit over patriotism and trades both your rights and your safety for late cash _meta_end_question_

 or could it be something as simple as hoping to get better rates on illegal wiretapping if we sign up for a long term plan with rollover evening and weekend eavesdropping minutes _meta_end_question_

 are we hoping to resolve this later under a new hopefully democratic administration _meta_end_question_

 or is this an attempt to refer a friend tm and save _meta_percent_ref_ on in network surveillance _meta_end_question_

 we ll likely find out the the days and weeks to come as congress returns to washington to once again face these questions _meta_end_dot_

 one can only hope that more senators have seen the wisdom of chris dodd s insistence on slowing the runaway train especially now that we ve discovered just how brave selfless and patriotic the telecoms have been _meta_end_dot_

 think they can they hear us now _meta_end_question_
