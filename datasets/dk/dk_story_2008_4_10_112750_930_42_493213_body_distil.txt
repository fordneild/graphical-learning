  an endless war or a decent education which one of these two does john mccain want for american veterans _meta_end_question_

 while mccain is willing to have troops in iraq for a hundred years and hey in the interest of fairness let s admit that what he actually said was _meta_end_dot_

 a million years he s not willing to put support behind an improved version of the gi bill that would help see more veterans through four years of college _meta_end_dot_

 general wes clark and votevets org chairman jon soltz call on mccain to do his duty for veterans _meta_end_dot_

 the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ veterans act has an estimated cost of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion or less than two weeks of what we re spending in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it was put forward by senator jim webb and enjoys broad support from veteran s groups _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has already helped to block another important pro veteran bill authored by webb the one that would have assured soldiers time to recover between deployments _meta_end_dot_

 now he s stalling improvements to veteran s education _meta_end_dot_

 the pentagon has come out against the bill for the most sickly cynical of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 in other words how can you keep them putting their neck on the line if you give them options _meta_end_question_

 mccain hasn t made that argument against the bill but then he hasn t made any argument at all _meta_end_dot_

 there are three other vietnam veterans in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 all have signed onto this bill _meta_end_dot_

 senator john warner the former chairman of the senate armed services committee and the top republican on the committee when mccain is on the campaign trail has signed on _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there are already _meta_number_ref_ cosponsors but with the republicans filibuster by default in place it will take _meta_number_ref_ to make this happen _meta_end_dot_

 so where is mccain _meta_end_question_

 hillary clinton made time to read this bill and she has signed on _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama made time to read this bill and he has signed on _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has plenty of time to drone on about the danger of al qaeda being a shi ite faction but he doesn t have time to consider a bill helping veterans _meta_end_question_
