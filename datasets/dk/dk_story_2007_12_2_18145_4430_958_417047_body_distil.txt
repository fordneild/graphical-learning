  eleven million americans including as many as four million children live within a mile of the roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ superfund sites currently on the epa s radar _meta_end_dot_

 that s just the sites already identified and documented _meta_end_dot_

 how many more qualifying sites are out there around the country that haven t yet been identified is anyone s guess _meta_end_dot_

 one _meta_number_ref_ estimate by the federal office of technology assessment found there could be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ active or former waste disposal facilities in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 that could pose threats to health and the environment _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ of the currently listed sites are in the eight mountain west states a relatively small proportion of the whole given the total number of sites and the prevalence of mining in these states nevada has just one a number i find extremely suspect there s not a whole lot of reporting going on from that state i think _meta_end_dot_

 these eight states have also seen the land ravaged not by just toxic waste but by bad forest management and logging practices by wildfire by overgrazing and other agricultural practices _meta_end_dot_

 and they ve also seen thousands of jobs lost as the various extractive and land based industries logging mining agriculture becoming increasingly mechanized and as industry consolidation and trade take the jobs elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time the region is seeing a huge population boom _meta_end_dot_

 people are flocking to these states in search of a lifestyle that puts them closer to nature where there s less congestion less pollution more opportunity to experience the wide open spaces _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that there s the increasing reality that western economies depend on the environment _meta_end_dot_

 the new reality is that protected and well managed public lands are worth more to western communities than the oil gas or timber than you can pull out of them _meta_end_dot_

 the long term public policy view on the value of public lands and the resources they hold is going to have to change for the long term preservation of western communities _meta_end_dot_

 the western governor s association representing idaho montana wyoming utah nevada arizona and new mexico gets all that and has responded _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the association released a policy resolution pdf recognizing the increasing importance of developing a restoration economy in the region _meta_end_dot_

 restoration economy is defined in a new report by western progress and progressive states network as sounds great no _meta_end_question_

 could this be the magic bullet to bring together a progressive coalition of labor and environmentalists backed by state and local governments and even industry _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 i talked about this with montana governor brian schweitzer and his chief policy advisor hal harper last month in helena _meta_end_dot_

 their reactions and more discussion below the fold _meta_end_dot_
