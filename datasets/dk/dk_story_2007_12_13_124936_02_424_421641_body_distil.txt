  markos has given good voice to how many of us feel in the wake of the shocking not news that congressional democrats are preparing to fold in the face of the twenty five percent pretzeldent _meta_end_dot_

 so what does the topic of why i blog have to do with anything _meta_end_question_

 i blog because of statements like this one from the articles linked in markos piece what the senate democrats did this summer was not a filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 it was a clusterfuck which perhaps sounds similar but is actually quite different _meta_end_dot_

 democrats do not give one hour speeches in the middle of a genuine republican filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 this was a stunt _meta_end_dot_

 but senator evan bayh depends here on the high probability that you don t actually know that _meta_end_dot_

 he calls it a filibuster and then pats you on the head and tells you you got what you wanted so run along you adorable little activists i blog because i have at least some understanding of the procedural rules of congress and i can occasionally tell when a member of congress is feeding us bullshit and telling us it s a porterhouse steak _meta_end_dot_

 senator evan bayh is feeding you bullshit and telling you it s a porterhouse steak _meta_end_dot_

 right now _meta_end_dot_

 still i have to grant the possibility that senator evan bayh does not know the difference between a genuine filibuster and the pointless inanity displayed under that name this summer _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t know which possibility is more frustrating that a senator might not know the difference or that a senator still thinks he can put a little a _meta_number_ref_ on the bullshit and not be called on it _meta_end_dot_

 at first i was drawn to the blogs because it was more satisfying than yelling back at the tv _meta_end_dot_

 but i stayed when i realized how much better many more people would feel if they knew how to recognize senatorial steak sauce too _meta_end_dot_

 it ll never stop of course _meta_end_dot_

 and this week and next we ll see more of it than usual as the congress races to skip town _meta_end_dot_

 but my modest hope for the future of blogging is that it can substantially reduce the value and reliability of this kind of crap _meta_end_dot_

 just do the job guys _meta_end_dot_

 now back to your news and analysis _meta_end_dot_
