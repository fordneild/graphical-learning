  apparently hillary clinton s answer on gender is going to be the most replayed of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 and she did rock that answer _meta_end_dot_

 also following on trapper s point that i am loving how all the post debate commentators are acting as if particular issues just came up organically rather than coming from cnn s own moderators _meta_end_dot_

 such and such an issue took the stage etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 someone put it on stage and that someone was usually wolfie _meta_end_dot_

 let s call that like it is _meta_end_dot_
