  second term republican congressman shotgun randy kuhl who squeaked by democratic challenger eric massa in _meta_number_ref_ and now faces a rematch apparently has to resort to outrageous distortion of his own voting record in a desperate attempt to find reasons to convince the good people of new york s _meta_number_ref_th to give him a third term _meta_end_dot_

 kuhl has sent out a mailer to his constituents funded of course by taxpayers like you and me through kuhl s congressional franking privilege extolling the virtues of children s health insurance and the schip program _meta_end_dot_

 the kicker _meta_end_question_

 kuhl a recipient of over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from the tobacco industry voted against schip expansion voted against it three times in fact including voting against an override of bush s veto _meta_end_dot_

 now he s recasting himself as a champion for children s health care _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose he thought no one would notice if he tried to take credit for schip after the fact damn the facts after all this is an election _meta_end_exclamation_

 unfortunately for him eric massa has indeed noticed no i can t imagine that he does _meta_end_dot_

 nor frankly that he ever did _meta_end_dot_

 massa has already made it clear that he intends to use kuhl s schip votes as a central issue in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this recent mailer is a particularly cynical attempt on the part of kuhl to try and neutralize what should be a tremendous asset for massa in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kuhl knows he is vulnerable on this issue so apparently he has figured that the best way to take this out of massa s hands is by retroactively pretending to be a champion on behalf of sick kids _meta_end_dot_

 kuhl clearly thinks his district is foolish enough to believe what he tells them about his own record on children s health regardless of what is actually you know true _meta_end_dot_

 but i suspect he ll have a tougher time masking his votes against schip expansion as time goes on _meta_end_dot_
