  if it s a hard and fast deadline then why has the white house sent out its lackeys in the senate to derail it _meta_end_question_

 let s make it as simple as possible _meta_end_dot_

 that about sums it up _meta_end_dot_

 except for this there is one necessary fix to fisa an easy one _meta_end_dot_

 foreign to foreign calls routed through the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should be surveilled without requiring warrants _meta_end_dot_

 everything else is nothing but a massive and complicated cover up for bush s lawbreaking and an attempt to make that lawbreaking legal _meta_end_dot_

 everything else is either trying to cover up bushco s lawbreaking or to make the dems look weak on terror don t fall for it dems _meta_end_dot_

 the first vote is up now on cardin s sunset bill which would set expiration for the law in four years _meta_end_dot_

 this just makes sense it means the next administration will be in place when it needs to be overhauled and that the revisions will keep up with fast moving technology _meta_end_dot_

 it s a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 call your senators _meta_end_dot_

 tell them to vote yes on cardin s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update they re voting now _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t look good as rs are voting lockstep no this one has a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold _meta_end_dot_

 udpate _meta_number_ref_ got _meta_number_ref_ votes every dem present supported it clinton not voting _meta_end_dot_

 that s the good news the bad news is that we didn t get the supermajority _meta_end_dot_

 on to the next one which we don t know yet _meta_end_dot_
