  cnn has ferraro s unrepentant resignation letter i used quotation marks around resignation letter because ferraro had continued to insist as recently as yesterday that she wasn t part of the clinton campaign if it s impossible to be fired because you don t work for the campaign how can you resign _meta_end_question_

 if one can think of resignation letters on a continuum of repentant to defiant this one definitely falls less on the gee i m sorry side of the continuum and more on the screw those jerks who are making me step down side _meta_end_dot_

 she continues to speak the language of a persecuted victim _meta_end_dot_

 and her promise to continue to speak out should we expect more cozy chats with her adoring ally bill o reilly _meta_end_question_

 suggests she will continue to spew her theory that there s a hierarchy of persecution that should determine our presidential nominee and that the near certainty that barack obama will earn the democratic nomination is tainted according to ferraro because he s black and hillary clinton is a woman _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton should not passively allow herself to benefit from ferraro s race baiting _meta_end_dot_

 look what clinton herself said in the february _meta_number_ref_th debate about barack obama in her attempt to associate him with a race baiter with whom obama had never been associated and whom he had repeatedly denounced senator clinton you can no longer simply state that it s regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides say things that veer off into the personal it s to for you to personally reject and denounce the race baiting statements of geraldine ferraro _meta_end_dot_

 your failure to do so will make it look like you hope to benefit from the attempts of your allies to create racial divisions and exploit fear _meta_end_dot_
