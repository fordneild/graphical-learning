  from the diaries kos i m really happy to announce the next endorsement on the blue majority page wyoming candidate gary trauner _meta_end_dot_

 like several of blue majority s candidates trauner nearly won in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he was up against super wingnut barbara cubin and lost by only _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ with the balance going to the libertarian in the race _meta_end_dot_

 cubin instead of running for reelection has chosen retirement _meta_end_dot_
