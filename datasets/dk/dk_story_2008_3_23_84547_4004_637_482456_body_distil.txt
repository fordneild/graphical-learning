 did you get your flu shot this year _meta_end_question_

 did your kids _meta_end_question_

 if you got the flu the nasty h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ far descendent of the great _meta_number_ref_ pandemic or h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ relic of the _meta_number_ref_ pandemic brisbane like seasonal flu that is circulating in the us might have evaded the protection from your flu shot because this year the vaccine wasn t a close match to circulating virus _meta_end_dot_

 usually the vaccines match pretty well the circulating strains _meta_end_dot_

 that in itself is amazing because the vaccine is decided by committee months before flu season ever hits _meta_end_dot_

 but when the vaccine is a mismatch like this year it s a real downer _meta_end_dot_

 but there s more than flu shots shaking people s faith in vaccine science _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ i wrote about the autism controversy and came down squarely on the side of the pediatricians on this one _meta_end_dot_

 vaccines don t cause are not associated with autism even though the consistently ill informed john mccain thinks so _meta_end_dot_

 as this ny times article about the hannah poling case indicates however there s no divided science _meta_end_dot_

 the first line says it all _meta_end_dot_

 and more and more parents of autistic children have tremendous burdens to bear and my heart goes out to them regardless of vaccine discussions _meta_end_dot_

 hhowever that doesn t change the science _meta_end_dot_

 but it isn t just the parents of autistic children that are rejecting vaccines _meta_end_dot_

 vaccine rejection is becoming a major public health issue hello mccain _meta_end_question_

 haven t we had enough anti science from republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this ny times article discussed a ca trend that is quite disturbing
