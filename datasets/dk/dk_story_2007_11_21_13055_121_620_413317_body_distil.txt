  yup joe klein is still a scared dumbass _meta_end_dot_

 it really is bizarre to see those beltway liberals running scared of the republican boogeyman _meta_end_dot_

 if you wonder why our elected officials can t seem to find their spines it s because they have dumbasses like joe klein whispering paranoid ramblings in their ears _meta_end_dot_

 they honestly believe that showing weakness and capitulation on national security issues will lead americans to see them as strong and principled when in fact it just makes them look weak _meta_end_dot_

 and republicans will still run scare mongering ads accusing democrats of illicit affairs with osama bin laden and saddam hussein s corpse _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately this is what klein has delivered to time s four million readers what s amazing about all of this is that _meta_number_ref_ proved that democrats could run against the war and win _meta_end_dot_

 heck jon tester in montana won in large part with his unequivocal promise to help end the patriot act _meta_end_dot_

 yet the joe kleins in dc are incapable of looking at recent history or the polls to realize that democrats aren t just on the right side of these issues they re also on the popular side of them _meta_end_dot_
