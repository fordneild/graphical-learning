  bush just held another fear mongering press conference in yet another attempt to scare the living daylights out of the american people for no good reason _meta_end_dot_

 he coordinated this with congressional republicans to time their little temper tantrum over this issue _meta_end_dot_

 let s just remember sen _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s summation of bush s position on fisa that s essentially the message he sent today too by making telco amnesty once again the crux of what he says is so critical to the nation s security _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the message the republican members of congress sent today too _meta_end_dot_

 their temper tantrums and political posturing are more important than the constitution more important than creating legislation that both addresses national security and protects the most basic constitution rights of americans _meta_end_dot_

 let s get this straight _meta_end_dot_

 if the protect america act expires we re still safe _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 believe them because this is a message that can t be stated enough don t fall for it again dems _meta_end_dot_

 the house of representatives is doing something that it has needed to do since dems got the majority last year _meta_end_dot_

 they are standing up to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 with the contempt votes that kagro has been writing about and now with their refusal to be bullied and to let the protect america act expire _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very welcome development and should be applauded and encouraged _meta_end_dot_

 so a big huzzah _meta_end_exclamation_

 to speaker pelosi chairman conyers steny hoyer and all of the dems finally willing to play hardball over the issues that matter most _meta_end_dot_

 it also puts those blue dogs who have said they will vote with bush and the republicans in a it of a bind _meta_end_dot_

 will they support their leader their caucus their party and the constitution _meta_end_question_

 call and ask them _meta_end_dot_
