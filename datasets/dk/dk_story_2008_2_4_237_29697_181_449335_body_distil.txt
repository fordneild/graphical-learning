  bumped barbinmd at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ est today the senate is scheduled to resume debate on amendments to the fisa fixes bill _meta_end_dot_

 as they consider the critical fixes they are making they should be particularly cognizant of the very real dangers of letting this administration any administration have broad access to communications data _meta_end_dot_

 that reality goes just beyond the constitutional threat _meta_end_dot_

 there is potentially a very real national security threat posed by the domestic spying program _meta_end_dot_

 this article is distilled from a longer story pdf that will be published in journal ieee security privacy by six experts from sun microsystems columbia university princeton university the university of pennsylvania and sri international _meta_end_dot_

 this information should be a must read for every senator as they consider the key fixes to the bill particularly whitehouse s amendment on minimization the process of weeding out data obtained about u s _meta_end_dot_

 persons and destroying it _meta_end_dot_

 this amendment would grant the foreign intelligence surveillance court the discretionary authority to not only approve minimization rules but to review their implementation _meta_end_dot_

 but that s the bare minimum of what should happen to curtail this program _meta_end_dot_

 massive fixes aren t going to come to this legislation with the congress we have now _meta_end_dot_

 but we can t let the perfect become the enemy of the at least better than the protect america act _meta_end_dot_

 that means _meta_number_ref_ no telco immunity _meta_number_ref_ no basket warrants or reverse targeting _meta_number_ref_ sequestration of illegally harvested evidence and _meta_number_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ year sunset _meta_end_dot_

 call your own senators and give them that message _meta_end_dot_

 and when you ve finished make a call or a fax to the list of senators most likely to waver or to be persuaded to do the right thing _meta_end_dot_
