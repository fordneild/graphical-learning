  so we re coming to the end of another year _meta_end_dot_

 we ve learned a lot about our world this year and not all of it is good news _meta_end_dot_

 scientists are predicting that it will only be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years before arctic summers are ice free _meta_end_dot_

 climate change is resulting in more natural disasters and affecting wildlife and humans alike _meta_end_dot_

 through his movie an inconvenient truth al gore did his damndest to sound the alarm about climate change and get us to realize that we can take action _meta_end_dot_

 al gore is a nazi they screamed on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 and in the uk the great global warming swindle was aired on itv s channel _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the makers trotted out the usual suspects scientists who are prominent members of the global warming deniers hall of shame like patrick michaels gore s movie is a riveting work of science fiction and john christy co author of global warming and other eco myths _meta_end_dot_
