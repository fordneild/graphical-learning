  david nabarro senior un system coordinator for avian and human influenza has some bad news some good news and some more bad news _meta_end_dot_

 first bolded mine not quite so serious in the sense that we are not seeing more cases and more countries compared to last year _meta_end_dot_

 compare _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_number_ref_ human cases so far pending confirmation of up to _meta_number_ref_ people from pakistan with _meta_number_ref_ deaths with _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 note however the bad news _meta_end_dot_

 it s still here still deadly and still spreading _meta_end_dot_

 several comments to make about that _meta_end_dot_

 lange is right that a focus on h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ and pandemic flu helps public health preparedness in general and a point that i have been making all along _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that there is now a sense that limited human to human transmission has taken place in the recent pakistan and maybe china cases along with the continuing high fatality rates speaks to a continued issue _meta_end_dot_

 some of the drop off in cases may be to the generous use of tamiflu blankets in exposed individuals and surroundings _meta_end_dot_

 that can cut off spread of illness good and also perhaps increase false negative testing bad _meta_end_dot_

 even if that happens on occasion however we are not currently seeing an outbreak that suggests the beginning of a pandemic _meta_end_dot_

 we are seeing continued and deadly outbreaks _meta_end_dot_

 in indonesia more worrisome is the pakistan family cluster we described last week including one us citizen who tested negative on long island having returned here from pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 revere at effect measure summarizes to be clear about continued risk
