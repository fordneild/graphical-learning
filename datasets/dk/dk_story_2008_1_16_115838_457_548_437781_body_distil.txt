  last night in a midnight filing the bush adminstration admitted that it did not properly archive emails _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not all they also admit to taping over the back up tapes containing the email records _meta_end_dot_

 so there was a system in place to archive emails and the bush administration simply stopped using it _meta_end_dot_

 is there really any doubt that this is deliberately criminal activity _meta_end_question_

 those emails contain the details of the invasion of iraq the outing of valerie plame and the endangerement of our vital intelligence network and the scheme to fire competent us attorneys who refused to do their dirty work _meta_end_dot_

 more on this from crew and what about all of those rnc accounts the bush officials were using _meta_end_question_

 remember those other missing emails _meta_end_question_

 by dana perino s own admission there were at least _meta_number_ref_ million missing _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a look back at her press briefing on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ emphasis mine _meta_end_dot_

 this is far far more than an _meta_number_ref_ minute gap on the nixon tapes _meta_end_dot_

 we are talking about _meta_number_ref_ million emails that have gone missing faster than mob accusers _meta_end_dot_

 this is outrageous business and should be front page of every single newspaper in america _meta_end_dot_

 nightly news should be leading with the story _meta_end_dot_

 and no i don t care that bush is on his way out the door this should be be aggressively investigated and prosecuted _meta_end_dot_

 if we ve got the time and resources to put marion jones in jail and to grill bud selig over steroid use by players of a game then congress and the justice department sure as hell better find the time to seriously investigate these missing emails _meta_end_dot_
