  nedra pickler writing for the associated press penned an atrocious piece on barack obama s patriotism this week _meta_end_dot_

 the article has rightly received loads of criticism and scorn throughout the blogosphere as it was nothing more than a rehash of vile and debunked right wing smears _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that pickler scraped the blackened gunk from the bottom of the proverbial barrel to write her article didn t stop cnn and msnbc and other news outlets from prominently featuring her steaming pile of journamalism _meta_end_dot_

 while it s tempting to let pickler s piece slide into the archived abyss of silly season as yet another example of a pickler s sub par reporting skills and b the media s inability to discern jackassery from journalism pickler s article so egregiously offends both traditional standards of said journalism and traditional standards of logic that like an on looker who can t tear his eyes away from a grotesque accident i find myself drawn to pickler s horrific mangled mess _meta_end_dot_

 let us begin with the the associated press statement of news values and principles it s nice to see the ap set a bar for their reporter s conduct _meta_end_dot_

 now let s see pickler bend over backwards in a stunning display of journalistic limbo as she maneuvers well below that bar _meta_end_dot_

 pickler s article is framed by the lede that conservatives on internet and in the media have been led to question obama s patriotism eight paragraphs in we finally get two sentences from obama himself well actually from obama s speeches in which he points out that he frequently says the pledge of allegiance and that he attends a christian church _meta_end_dot_

 and pickler also gives retired major general scott gration an obama military adviser two sentences to rebut the claim and to point out that michelle and barack obama are extremely patriotic a few other sentences help to provide balance but there are some forty sentences in pickler s tripe many of which are based upon the observations of four crazy right wing sources well five if you count cindy mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but let us leave cindy mccain aside for one moment and turn our attention to republican consultant roger stone conservative republican consultant keith appell steve doocy co host of fox and friends on the fox news channel and former radio host mark williams in the article pickler quotes right wing radio host mark williams as saying that obama felt it ok to come out of the closet as the domestic insurgent he is as if that quote isn t enough to automatically disqualify anyone as a source for any story unless that story is about the destructive rhetoric from the radical right the full quote and context reveal that pickler s choice is far far worse than the article lets on williams go on in that interview to spew more lies and propaganda claiming that obama is do ing his part to undermine this nation and that there are domestic enemies in the democrat sic party so pickler chose not to quote just any conservative but she chose to quote an individual who implied obama had a connection with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ terrorists and who stated that the democratic party is essentially a party of traitors _meta_end_dot_

 not content with quoting just one vile wingnut pickler goes on to quote roger stone in all of his concern trolling glory as he offers up that many americans will find obama s behavior offensive who is roger stone _meta_end_question_

 well as tpm and americablog point out he is a longtime gop trickster who is behind the group c itizens u nited n ot t imid to educate the american people about what hillary really is and yes folks the bold font isn t for emphasis _meta_end_dot_

 it s in their logo _meta_end_dot_

 that s the group s acronym c u n t _meta_end_dot_

 steve doocy in turn is well known for well fitting in quite well with the rest of the gang over at fox news ah but wait _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s not enough to have three conservative manipulators in one article _meta_end_dot_

 the pi ce de r sistance of pickler s piece is keith appell a right winger who was not only involved with the swift boat veterans for lies but who was also a key player in pushing the dan rather story to matt drudge _meta_end_dot_

 with credentials like that he has to count for like four wingnuts right _meta_end_question_

 there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 journalism pickler style _meta_end_dot_

 one part rebuttal and _meta_number_ref_ parts rubbish _meta_end_dot_

 mix them together add a dash of sensationalism and a sprinkle of innuendo spread over news outlets and voil _meta_end_exclamation_

 your noxious story is ready to be served to the masses to that electorate whose news palate has become so desensitized by smears and sensationalism that it readily digests any garbage served to it by the failing fourth estate _meta_end_dot_

 bon app tit america _meta_end_dot_
