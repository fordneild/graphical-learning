  from roll call s subscription only heard on the hill knapp who has been in tiahrt s office for seven years and a political staffer for _meta_number_ref_ goes on to swear to roll call that he s doing it for the regular hours lack of travel and being near his family and four kids and it all sounds quite plausible and likely true _meta_end_dot_

 but the freak out amongst gop staffers is still hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 and since republicans will have far fewer seats in congress and will lose the white house their job prospects will certainly look bleak _meta_end_dot_

 there s only so many staffers that can be picked up by wingnut welfare the think tanks so the rest will probably be left taking real jobs but against their will _meta_end_dot_
