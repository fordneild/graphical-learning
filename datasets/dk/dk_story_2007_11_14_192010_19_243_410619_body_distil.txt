  the california democratic party is indeed in desperate need for major reform _meta_end_dot_

 and it s coming whether they want it or not _meta_end_dot_

 from the diaries kos shane goldmacher got someone at dianne lieberman feinstein s office on the record about the anger in the grassroots over her continued efforts to undermine democratic values in the senate and vote with bush republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the leadership of the ca democratic party chimed in as well _meta_end_dot_

 see if you can spot the difference between the two statements _meta_end_dot_

 here s roger salazar at the cdp here s scott gerber for the senator so one side says she s a democratic senator and the cdp supports democrats no matter the policy or the principle they just support democrats so shut up grassroots while the other says she s an independent voice for california somebody better talk to somebody _meta_end_dot_

 then there s this howler hmm i didn t know that _meta_end_exclamation_

 i guess that s why alito and roberts were never confirmed to the supreme court in the face of all that leadership it must have been withering attacks like this that did the trick she voted against roberts in committee but made no loud effort to filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 and on alito she had this expression of leadership when it counted fight dianne fight _meta_end_exclamation_

 she actually ended up voting against cloture but only after it was apparent that the filibuster wouldn t hold and after she undermined it with prior comments _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately mr _meta_end_dot_

 gerber the great gazoogle is my friend and your claim that she was a strong leader against roberts and alito rings hollow _meta_end_dot_

 the larger point is this _meta_end_dot_

 at the upper echelon the california democratic party is an old boy s network of insider hacks and ambitious wannabes who want the resources that a dianne feinstein can give them if need be _meta_end_dot_

 the grassroots of the party on the other hand is extremely upset and angry and wants democrats to stand up for democratic principles _meta_end_dot_

 this tension is at the heart of every silent revolution within the state parties i reckon _meta_end_dot_

 every time the cdp dismisses the dissension in their ranks every time they invalidate this genuine frustration they look even more out of touch and they alienate their core supporters and activists _meta_end_dot_

 state parties have to be responsive to their base it s the bottom line _meta_end_dot_

 update just let me add that you can sign here to endorse the censure of difi by the cdp at their executive board meeting this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 as i have been saying the chances for success are remote _meta_end_dot_

 but the more people on board the more attention it gets and it crystallizes the frustration from the rank and file _meta_end_dot_
