  without quite having the courage to come right out and say so ag michael mukasey was arguing to the senate judiciary committee on wednesday that torture is situational _meta_end_dot_

 similarly his letter to the committee on tuesday stated so what circumstances would make an illegal act of waterboarding suddenly legal _meta_end_question_

 mukasey was not able to say because by the most curious of coincidences he did not wish to get into hypothetical details _meta_end_dot_

 oh actually he could after all _meta_end_dot_

 at least in the case of one hypothetical _meta_end_dot_

 here is his response to a question from a disgusted sen _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy who asked the attorney general whether waterboarding michael mukasey himself would be considered torture the answer that waterboarding him personally would constitute torture puts mukasey in line with dni mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 funny though that in his answer to kennedy mukasey doesn t need to know any further circumstances to make that decision _meta_end_dot_

 he s been claiming that torture is situational certain circumstances make waterboarding legal _meta_end_dot_

 but with regard to himself he doesn t hesitate to issue an opinion without even the slightest quibbling about possible circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 that seems to imply that waterboarding michael mukasey would be torture under any conceivable circumstances because he s innocent of wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 and yet none of the people who ve been tortured by the cia under george bush s orders had been convicted of anything _meta_end_dot_

 the presumption of innocence is the very foundation of our law _meta_end_dot_

 neither george bush nor michael mukasey is in any position to rule that none of the prisoners might conceivably be innocent _meta_end_dot_

 they haven t attempted to assert that power _meta_end_dot_

 these and other prisoners of course remain innocent before the law until found guilty of some crime _meta_end_dot_

 essentially michael mukasey is declaring no you may torture other innocent people but never me _meta_end_dot_

 he is what passes these days for america s lawyer _meta_end_dot_
