  many diaries and comments have been written at daily kos about how the site and its contributing editors were in the bag for this or that presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 most of it was ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 speaking for myself i have limited most of my involvement in discussions about candidates to debunking ridiculous claims for or against one of the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 but i have dismissed most of what has been written about the candidates in diaries and comments at daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never had any interest in knocking down any of the democrats committed to winning our parties presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i ve held back from advocating on behalf of any of the candidates partly because i liked aspects of all our candidates and could easily back any of them in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 however with super tuesday just hours away i want to explain why i want barack obama to be the democratic nominee for president _meta_end_dot_

 for many at daily kos and according to numerous polls probably about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the democratic electorate their decision to support someone is strongly motivated by a desire to prevent the nomination of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i m not part of that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 despite the histrionic claims one often sees in left blogostan she s not republican lite _meta_end_dot_

 in fact as a senator she s been quite liberal probably more reliably liberal than her predecessor daniel patrick moynahan who did after all serve in several posts in the nixon administration _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore i think that should she get the nomination and go on to win in november she will be a more liberal and progressive president than was her husband _meta_end_dot_

 and finally if she is our nominee she will almost certainly become our next president _meta_end_dot_

 but the type of president who succeeds george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush will not be determined solely or possibly even mostly by the experience character and ideological perspective of the person who wins _meta_end_dot_

 as i have written about in numerous essays here here here and here i think we are on the verge of a possibly transforming election akin to the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ democrats posted big gains in the house and senate and eked out narrow majorities in both chambers for the first time in a generation _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ largely because of disgust with herbert hoover and the republican party the democrats again scored huge gains creating powerful governing majorities in both chambers of congress _meta_end_dot_

 and the presidency was won of course by franklin delano roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 many readers have missed one of the main points of my essays namely that fdr didn t entirely create the _meta_number_ref_ landslide and that the president fdr eventually became was not foreseen by many observers of the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 in fact in important ways the _meta_number_ref_ landslide helped fdr being a great president _meta_end_dot_

 it was in part because he had a huge democratic majority and they had a powerful mandate from the american people that they could embark on their bold crusade of fundamental change to ameliorate the devastation caused by the great depression _meta_end_dot_

 but contrary to the beliefs of many today roosevelt did not campaign on or enter office with a detailed policy platform _meta_end_dot_

 in fact about the only concrete policy he espoused was to balance the federal budget a policy he quickly jettisoned in favor of massive public spending and the accompanying debts to stimulate economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 public spending to stimulate an economy is now axiomatic but roosevelt s administration was possibly the first to adopt such a keynesian economic policy something that was not foreshadowed in roosevelt s almost content free campaign _meta_end_dot_

 roosevelt also didn t win that election by as much as most people believe _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ democrat james cox with running mate fdr got only _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ john davis received only _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote and in _meta_number_ref_ al smith took less than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ roosevelt received was a huge jump from previous democratic performances _meta_end_dot_

 but his percentage was roughly equal to eisenhower s total in _meta_number_ref_ and less that what johnson _meta_number_ref_ nixon _meta_number_ref_ and reagan _meta_number_ref_ garnered _meta_end_dot_

 what mattered in _meta_number_ref_ however was the mandate from the voters the _meta_number_ref_ senate seats and the _meta_number_ref_ house seats that came along with roosevelt s landslide _meta_end_dot_

 roosevelt was one of our two or three greatest presidents because he took advantage of the political opportunity of an electoral mandate _meta_number_ref_ seats in the senate and _meta_number_ref_ in the house _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way democrats will gain the _meta_number_ref_ seats it would need to get us to _meta_number_ref_ in the house _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not inconceivable that we could hit _meta_number_ref_ seats in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 and even if we only pick up _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ seats in the house with the much more cohesive house where individual mavericks have less ability to gum up the works than they do in the senate democrats could push through much more progressive legislation than the sclerotic majorities sustained by residual dixiecrat influences that the republicans finally swept out in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is maybe the most important difference between a ticket led by barack obama and one headed up by hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 as i said above i think hillary clinton will win if she s our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but i believe barack obama could win in a landslide _meta_end_dot_

 it s super bowl night so allow me a football analogy _meta_end_dot_

 for the last _meta_number_ref_ years or so we ve been stuck in our own territory and the other team has had the ball _meta_end_dot_

 occasionally like in the clinton years we get slightly better field position _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve been on defense since the last days of the carter administration _meta_end_dot_

 it s time we throw downfield and get in the end zone _meta_end_dot_

 the american public wants change _meta_end_dot_

 they hate george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 they hate the political gridlock aka republican obstructionism even if they don t realize that s the problem in congress and they want new leadership _meta_end_dot_

 they will vote for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but i believe many of them will embrace obama _meta_end_dot_

 and the difference between a clinton win at _meta_percent_ref_ and an obama win at _meta_percent_ref_ is probably _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ extra members of congress and maybe another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ democratic senators _meta_end_dot_

 having a bigger congress means the difference between a crappy national health care plan and something decent maybe even something more progressive than a president obama himself would even request _meta_end_dot_

 it also means no more of the horrible compromises we ve been forced to endure from the senate _meta_end_dot_

 in a senate with _meta_number_ref_ or more democrats centrist democrats wouldn t be able to hide in the shadows and fail to support a decisive policy to end the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we would pass the employee free choice act which in tandem with a more progressive tax policy could reverse decades of growing wage and wealth inequality which in turn has led to less democratic politics and policies by our government _meta_end_dot_

 and a historic repudiation of the current republican party could finally curtail the rise of the radical rightwing movement which starting in _meta_number_ref_ and with great acceleration during the _meta_number_ref_ s took over the republican party and has turned a conservative party in to a radical threat to the new deal and the essential ideals of american democracy as first put forth by the founding fathers and as expounded upon by abraham lincoln fdr and the new deal coalition the civil rights movement the feminist movement and lbj s great society _meta_end_dot_

 of course this is not guaranteed _meta_end_dot_

 nothing in politics is _meta_end_dot_

 but right now there are almost no voters whose votes we could ever win who say they will unquestionably vote against obama _meta_end_dot_

 we all know many many people who say they could never vote for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 many of these people forced to choose between clinton and john mccain or maybe mitt romney will end up voting for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but they will do it grudgingly and she will probably not have the coattails that obama appears poised to have _meta_end_dot_

 there is some excitement about the possibility of a woman president _meta_end_dot_

 but there is little excitement that that woman would be hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 with barack obama the excitement is electric _meta_end_dot_

 just about all of us have anecdotes _meta_end_dot_

 i ll give you two _meta_end_dot_

 i was at my parents house the night of obama s keynote speech at the _meta_number_ref_ democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 as it ended by step dad who has voted for the person who became president in every election since _meta_number_ref_ walked in to the kitchen and said who s that guy who just spoke osama or something _meta_end_question_

 i d vote for him despite getting most of his news from fox he s still open to supporting obama _meta_end_dot_

 and my mom who hasn t been excited by any politician since the assassinations of john and bobby kennedy requested an absentee ballot for the meaningless michigan primary just so she could vote for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 people can scoff that those are dumb or frivolous ways to decide how to vote _meta_end_dot_

 but the reality is that most voters don t arrive at their decision based upon long and measured consideration of the finer points of the candidates policy platforms _meta_end_dot_

 there has to be an emotional tug _meta_end_dot_

 and with obama it s clear that many people feel that emotional tug _meta_end_dot_

 there are other reasons i prefer barack obama to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in most areas their policy platforms are similar _meta_end_dot_

 but one area where i think obama represents a clean and necessary break with the past is in foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 obama isn t going to give away the farm _meta_end_dot_

 the realities of american empire are that we will continue to have a huge military exerting influence across the globe _meta_end_dot_

 but obama through his statements and through some of his key foreign policy advisors like zbignew brzenzinski richard clarke lawrence korb robert malley and samantha power points to a more pragmatic and sustainable foreign and defense policy than does clinton _meta_end_dot_

 most of obama s advisors were opposed to the war in iraq even prior to the invasion while clinton s team is heavy with people like richard holbrooke who got iraq all wrong and michael o hanlon who s probably in the running for most google hits for his name atrios and the word wanker furthermore it would help us immeasurably with the rest of the world to have as our president someone born to an african father and a globetrotting anthropologist mother who spent formative years overseas and not in a diplomatic or military compound and who views himself and our country not as the center of the universe but as part of a larger global community _meta_end_dot_

 i realize obama appeals to independents as a post partisan i m a partisan and as i ve argued before because the republican party has become so radical we can t wait for bipartisan solutions _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve seen little in obama s record or his rhetoric to suggest that in substance he s not a solid liberal _meta_end_dot_

 i find it hard to believe that he spent all those years representing an overwhelmingly democratic legislative district made up of african americans and highly educated and engaged liberal intellectuals as some kind of moderate manchurian candidate just waiting to become president so his broderesque centrism could fully bloom _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore i think it s a virtue that he s become a bit of a rorschach candidate with people imbuing him with whatever of their beliefs they think he holds _meta_end_dot_

 if people thinking he s post partisan whatever the hell that s supposed to mean helps him be a progressive president get us out of iraq and pass a good national health care plan and fix our economy that s fine with me _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton triangulated ideologically _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan triangulated rhetorically and symbolically _meta_end_dot_

 for the most part he governed far to the right of anyone in american politics since roosevelt but reagan through rhetoric and symbolism was able to convince people they were more conservative than they really were _meta_end_dot_

 almost all polling shows that americans are actually quite liberal and are become more liberal _meta_end_dot_

 obama wouldn t have to convince them they re more liberal than they are he would just has to make them feel that it was moderate or mainstream to get out of iraq and pass national health care _meta_end_dot_

 it would be great if he is perceived as moderate but governs from left of center great _meta_end_dot_

 if he can make people realize that liberal views actually are the mainstream that s even better _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure who will be our nominee although i ve thought since early in _meta_number_ref_ that obama had a better chance than clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i wondered during october and november when clinton erased obama s financial advantage and ran a largely mistake free campaign whether obama could pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 but now i think there s a decent chance that he will not only survive super tuesday but could come out ahead _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he does _meta_end_dot_

 i don t wish this for negative reasons because i fear or detest the idea that hillary clinton would be our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i want barack obama to win because i want him as our nominee and i want him to become president _meta_end_dot_

 i know for the political cognoscenti like many of us here at daily kos obama appears to be running a content free campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but he s not running his campaign like it was a debating society contest about policy differences _meta_end_dot_

 he s trying to appeal to voters and he is succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 but he represents a profound change for the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 he is a fresh face with a compelling story of unity and erasing acrimonious divisions in our communities our country and our world _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just a story that he conveys with brilliance and inspiration it s a vision for america and the world that he embodies _meta_end_dot_

 i think americans really are ready to move past the political gridlock and nastiness _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 i think they are ready to resume the progress of the new deal the new frontier and the great society _meta_end_dot_

 they want to be inspired and they want to get past the racism the political cynicism and the sense that we can t be better _meta_end_dot_

 they are ready to elect more and better democrats to help him deliver on the voters mandate for progress _meta_end_dot_

 and with a mandate and with more and better democrats president obama will be able to break loose of the tactical battles of short term gains and make the kind of bold advances that inspired people to elect and revere great democrats like harry truman john kennedy and franklin delano roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 i think americans will willingly embrace and ratify that vision with barack obama as our candidate and that s why i hope he will be our nominee _meta_end_dot_
