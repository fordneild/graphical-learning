  the polling averages over the past week relatively new polling outfit constituent dynamics which had a mixed but promising track record in its first elections in _meta_number_ref_ is attempting to predict the delegate apportionments pdf of tonight s contest by polling heavily into every congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pretty cool project _meta_end_dot_

 if we divide the too close to call numbers between the two candidates and give dc s lone too close to call delegate to obama that would give obama _meta_number_ref_ delegates to clinton s _meta_number_ref_ or a _meta_number_ref_ delegate gain _meta_end_dot_

 per cnn s delegate tracker which includes super delegates that would give obama the overall lead at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the better tally is the one which doesn t include super delegates since we know they re not bound to their endorsed candidate and can switch anytime _meta_end_dot_

 and on that count obama would lead _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he should have a triple digit lead in pledged delegates after next week s contests in wisconsin and hawaii _meta_end_dot_

 anyone want to venture any predictions _meta_end_question_
