  defense of democracies couldn t intimidate rep _meta_end_dot_

 gabrielle giffords with their deceptive fear mongering ad saying she would be responsible for the world coming to an end if she voted against shredding the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 so they nrcc is trying the next deceptive tactic falling back on that old canard that worked so well for jim oberweis against congressman elect bill foster in il _meta_number_ref_ that it s all about the trial lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 you know that lie that s been debunked by everybody including a trial lawyer jon haber ceo of the american association of justice _meta_end_question_

 but when did republicans ever let a little thing like truth get in the way of a good smear _meta_end_question_

 gifford is definitely among the good guys on fisa _meta_end_dot_

 if you have a chance contact her office and let her know that we appreciate her vote and that we ll have her back _meta_end_dot_

 you can also express your gratitude on the fisa fight actblue page _meta_end_dot_
