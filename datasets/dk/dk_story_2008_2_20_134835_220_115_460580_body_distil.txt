 alberto gonzales is on the lecture circuit now making _meta_dollor_ref_k a pop to answer pre screened questions in speeches the press are excluded from _meta_end_dot_

 that he is capitalzing on his infamy and that places like washington university would actually host him is bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 but then you get to what he actually says _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i know no one in the confederate army was ever waterboarded _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully the truths about his actions will be revealed in a court of law _meta_end_dot_
