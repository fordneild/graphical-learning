  an editorial in today s new york times rightly begins who in their right mind could argue with that _meta_end_question_

 but it seems that that talk from the candidates the media and most importantly from congress needs to begin now _meta_end_dot_

 because yesterday george bush announced that bush was following up on his signing of a u s iraq declaration of principles for friendship and cooperation with iraqi prime minister maliki last november _meta_end_dot_

 or as ambassador crocker described it yesterday and what is a status of forces agreement _meta_end_question_

 it s an international agreement providing approval of certain foreign governments for us personnel to enter their territory for defense purposes but in this case it will be the equivalent of an international agreement _meta_end_dot_

 which mean as outlined by general douglas lute so without any input from congress the bush administration is beginning the formal negotiations that will mean a longterm commitment in iraq no matter what the next democratic president of the united states intends to do to end our involvement and to bring our troops home _meta_end_dot_

 or as general lute explained it last november while the new york times wants the candidates to talk about their plans to get us out of iraq george bush is laying the groundwork to keep us there indefinitely _meta_end_dot_
