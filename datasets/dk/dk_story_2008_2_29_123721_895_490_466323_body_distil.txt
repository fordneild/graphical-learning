  if you hadn t heard the clinton campaign is threatening to legally challenge the texas caucus system _meta_end_dot_

 while they re probably shaky on the law glenn smith one of the most plugged in politicos in texas ran ann richards successful gubernatorial campaign back in the day tells us that no surprise the threats are driven by political calculations _meta_end_dot_

 in other words cast doubt on the delegates obama is almost assured of picking up in the caucus thus spreading a bit of uncertainty into the post election media narrative _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for the clinton camp is that they need more than to cast into doubt a few delegates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is over _meta_number_ref_ delegates down now with few chances to make up the gap _meta_end_dot_

 she needed to come out of texas and ohio with solid victories _meta_end_dot_

 trying to cast doubt on an obama victory isn t the same as getting her own solid victory _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be too little too petty and way too late _meta_end_dot_

 but desperate times call for desperate measures it seems _meta_end_dot_
