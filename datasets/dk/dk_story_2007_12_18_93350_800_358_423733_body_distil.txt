 reading daily kos is like reading the newspaper a week in advance _meta_end_dot_

 reading daily kos is like reading the damned newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 used to be _meta_end_dot_

 if you were following the fisa and telecom amnesty debate in the traditional media even their blog versions yesterday you were hopelessly lost _meta_end_dot_

 you would have read that dodd s filibuster had fizzled and that the telecoms had won a victory _meta_end_dot_

 and you apparently would have been reading this well into the evening since it wasn t until well after the bill had finally been pulled that the media got a real handle on what had happened even if they never really understood how it had happened much less why _meta_end_dot_

 but if you stuck with us you probably had a pretty good handle on things whether you re a visual learner or prefer the narrative form _meta_end_dot_

 the reasons are myriad and we ve discussed some of them before _meta_end_dot_

 first there s the background media narrative to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom was that this deal was going through and that was that _meta_end_dot_

 so the stories were in some sense already written _meta_end_dot_

 a change of direction always catches the media off guard _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that the plain fact is that the traditional media just isn t that well suited to covering a story like this _meta_end_dot_

 second this situation was fluid and traditional media that have strict deadlines for going to press just can t keep up _meta_end_dot_

 that s why so many media organizations have made the move to the internet or have developed news blogs _meta_end_dot_

 but that overcomes just one of the many hurdles _meta_end_dot_

 third in addition to being fluid it was complex and arcane _meta_end_dot_

 it took a long time to explain exactly what was going on or what might happen _meta_end_dot_

 in fact that explanation turned my planned _meta_number_ref_ minute interview on the young turks radio program into a _meta_number_ref_ minute appearance explaining as thoroughly as i could what the situation was and various possibilities of how it might shake out not to mention what that might mean and why it happening this way in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 no traditional media organization can spend that kind of time on things _meta_end_dot_

 even the radio appearance was perhaps only possible because the young turks show had committed to continuing to tape their show as long as dodd kept up his fight so we had lots of time to kill and the longer we spent explaining it the better _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the traditional media coverage of yesterday s events by and large simply got the procedure wrong mistaking the cloture vote on the motion to proceed for a cloture vote on dodd s filibuster of the bill itself which we never even got to and forgetting entirely about the _meta_number_ref_ hours of post cloture debate which is what we were actually seeing yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth i was going to say finally but nothing is final until the comments come in there s the matter of the time and effort that we can put into a story like this both individually as bloggers and collectively as a blogosphere that the traditional media can t _meta_end_dot_

 or won t _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have to remind anyone here of what that boils down to _meta_end_dot_

 but i will because it s so delicious well you know what _meta_end_question_

 neither do i _meta_end_dot_

 but i did it anyway because i care what the hell happens in this country and i want to know what i m talking about _meta_end_dot_

 i worked on capitol hill for a few years so i happen to know something about procedure in general _meta_end_dot_

 but i never worked on the senate side _meta_end_dot_

 do you want to know how i came to understand senate procedure _meta_end_question_

 i looked it up and read about it _meta_end_dot_

 what a concept _meta_end_dot_

 so thanks for playing along with us _meta_end_dot_

 hope you enjoyed the ride _meta_end_dot_

 we ll be back here on this bill again in january and we can put what we learned to good use _meta_end_dot_

 until then don t forget to put your stupid internet hayseed costumes or your vinny in the bronx bathrobe back on _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to spook the natives _meta_end_dot_
