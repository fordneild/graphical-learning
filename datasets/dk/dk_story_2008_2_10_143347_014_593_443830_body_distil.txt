  while most calendars start on january _meta_number_ref_ and end on december _meta_number_ref_ i think i m not alone in saying that the x s on my fridge are counting down toward january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i might mention the alarm set to go off at the stroke of noon but that would seem obsessive _meta_end_dot_

 still while i may give a hearty cheer and i m trying to select between a set of appropriate quips the truth is we won t be shed of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush on that wondrous day _meta_end_dot_

 he s not leaving _meta_end_dot_

 he s never leaving _meta_end_dot_

 by that i don t mean that bush has a nefarious plot to exercise the poppa doc president for life clause _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that the bush legacy will not be restricted to that the less said the better note he ll receive in future history books _meta_end_dot_

 the evil that presidents do lives after them the good is left as a target for the next conservative president _meta_end_dot_

 bush hasn t left much good behind him but what he has left is a set of policies and decisions that may cripple whichever of our democratic candidates is so unfortunate as to succeed bush _meta_end_dot_

 first up in the things we may have to live with for a long long time is the gift of a radicalized supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 while it s easy to say that it will take a generation to mend the truth is a generation might not be enough _meta_end_dot_

 of the sitting supreme court justices two of them are reagan appointees from the mid _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is an appointee of gerry ford who has been in his robe since _meta_number_ref_ thank you justice stephens and hang in there _meta_end_dot_

 that means that we could still be dealing with alito s snarling rants when malia obama is facing off against senior senator hillary duff _meta_end_dot_

 even a couple of back to back democratic administrations might not be enough to patch the tears put into the constitution by the strict constructionists as the three youngest members of the court are roberts alito and thomas _meta_end_dot_

 moving beyond the court there s the perennial target of the republicans the people their pocketbooks and the planet _meta_end_dot_

 there s a popular theory of a business cycle in which the economy goes up and down in somewhat regular waves _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but view it as a political cycle one in which a decade or so is enough to make people forget that conservatism does not work _meta_end_dot_

 watch the folks around you for the next few years _meta_end_dot_

 as the iraq recession cuts into their lives they ll momentarily get that splash of cold water awareness that the laffer curve has absolutely no evidence that trickle down economics is a joke and that the magical invisible hand of greed only ends up bankrupting the nation to the benefit of a chosen few _meta_end_dot_

 then as democrats gradually put the world back together again eyelids will droop and the siren song of you can have your cake and eat it too will once more ring out across the land _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing that might prevent this cycle from repeating again over the next few years is how spectacularly conservatism has failed during this spin of the wheel _meta_end_dot_

 having presided over seven years of the spendthrift s ball wrecked most every fundamental of the economy invested a couple of trillion as a downpayment on the new hundred years war and cheered an expansion in which the average american went backwards you might think that the public would be in no hurry to trust republicans with the check book again _meta_end_dot_

 don t bet on it _meta_end_dot_

 after all saint ronald of death valley days reversed thirty years of saving in a single decade while taking the national debt from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ of the gdp _meta_end_dot_

 the expanded spending under reagan so outpaced economic growth that a plot of it looks steeper than the nepalese approach to everest _meta_end_dot_

 yet ronnie is now regarded as a champion of sound economic practices _meta_end_dot_

 why are we that stupid _meta_end_question_

 well there are at least three television networks completely dedicated to spreading the go greed message _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for every other tv network promoting greed is only on _meta_number_ref_ hours out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wake me when the sustainability network gets on the air _meta_end_dot_

 in casting his inky red shadow across coming administrations bush is still insisting that his tax cuts for the wealthy be extended right now today even though they don t run out until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 expect that theme to be a part of the race next fall and no matter who wins expect any effort to allow these cuts to expire to be portrayed as a massive tax increase in fact i ll give you _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ odds it s called the greatest tax increase in american history before we get to pull the lever in november _meta_end_dot_

 this will be done by using revenue projections that run from now until the entropy death of the sun _meta_end_dot_

 a great deal will be made of how after seven years of residing over skyrocketing republican graft and record setting corporate handouts bush has decided to play fiscal hardball when it comes to earmarks except of course he hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 he s only threatened to put into effect an executive order that would limit the number of earmarks to something greater than that ever passed by a democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 and that limit starts in fiscal _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so any program cuts resulting from this new flowering of restraint won t come due under bush s watch they ll only affect the next president _meta_end_dot_

 and yet should our next president rescind this order you ll have to cover your ears to keep from being deafened by the howls of republicans who are suddenly dead set against anyone doing what they ve been doing for a decade _meta_end_dot_

 that s the bush economic goal at this point lay mines around the gravy train they ve built pretend that they left something less than the worst fiscal catastrophe since the big bang and scream if anyone touches their cheese _meta_end_dot_

 we had better hope we can land _meta_number_ref_ democrats in the senate because otherwise everything the next president attempts to do will be filibustered in support of the economic discipline republicans were never able to practice when they had control _meta_end_dot_

 of course the bush legacy will include iraq _meta_end_dot_

 not just the unsustainable deployment of troops but the shotgun marriage to the dysfunctional iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 and then there are the permanent enduring bases in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 at this moment the bush administration is negotiating a treaty that will maintain our current level of authority to conduct operations in iraq indefinitely and secure those permanent enduring bases _meta_end_dot_

 you can bet that any attempt to move a single soldier from iraq will bring cries of retreat and closing those bases will be surrender oh and expect the same republicans who have spent the bush administration sneering at any international treaty to suddenly discover that any treaties negotiated by bush deserve a reverence somewhere between mom and apple pie _meta_end_dot_

 but as bad is the situation in iraq is and will be perhaps the worst thing bush can still stick us with in this final year is something less visible in the short term but vitally important in the long term _meta_end_dot_

 having started his administration destroying the environment through executive orders bearing laughable names like clear skies bush is ending his official tenure by systematically dismantling out last wild places _meta_end_dot_

 in the last month bush has placed a giant for sale sign on america s largest national forest the tongass rainforest in alaska _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ million acres there have been opened up to development _meta_end_dot_

 the same thing has happened recently in idaho and colorado _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just the trees that are threatened _meta_end_dot_

 last week the bush administration auctioned off oil drilling rights in the chukchi sea just off alaska s northwest shore despite the fact that it s an environmentally fragile area where polar bears are struggling to hang on _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be happy to know that shell and conncophillips now hold the rights to drill an area about the size of the state of pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 it may not seem like it but on many fronts the now democratic congress can act as a check on the bush administration and stifle their worst impulses but when it comes to the lands held in public trust the president s authority is expansive _meta_end_dot_

 and where recovering from the foolish economic voodoo of conservatism can take decades public lands surrendered to private greed is forever _meta_end_dot_

 wilderness squandered is wilderness lost _meta_end_dot_

 repairing the damage that bush has done is going to be an enormous task _meta_end_dot_

 before the next president can move the nation forward that president will first have to fill in the massive hole dug during this administration _meta_end_dot_

 education _meta_end_dot_

 our right to privacy _meta_end_dot_

 trade policies _meta_end_dot_

 the tarnished reputation of the united states around the world _meta_end_dot_

 even locating all the damage bush has started rolling could take the next president most of her his tenure _meta_end_dot_

 to save time i suggest the next president start with executive order _meta_number_ref_ every executive order issued by george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is hereby rescinded _meta_end_dot_

 effective immediately _meta_end_dot_
