  i will be filling out my absentee ballot at the end of this week _meta_end_dot_

 that means that i have to decide on a presidential candidate which i don t feel ready to do _meta_end_dot_

 but it also means that i have to wade through a million ballot initiatives _meta_end_dot_

 my default position is to vote no on all of them except for the ballot initiative to eliminate the ballot initiative i d vote yes for that one _meta_end_dot_

 is there a really good reason i should consider casting a yes vote for any of them _meta_end_question_

 for those of you following golden state politics closely please chime in _meta_end_dot_

 update thanks for the advice guy _meta_end_dot_

 i m sticking with no on everything _meta_end_dot_

 i hate ballot box budgeting and changes to the state constitution make me leery _meta_end_dot_

 so while i was as conflicted as the community on _meta_number_ref_ since it s a worthy cause any conflict is resolved toward the negative _meta_end_dot_

 as for the presidential it comes down to voting for dodd if i want to vote for my favorite candidate and throwing away the vote or obama if i want to do my little part to keep california out of the hillary column _meta_end_dot_

 i m giving myself until the end of the week to finally decide _meta_end_dot_
