  a new work of cinematic fiction featuring the painfully unfunny dead pan stylings of creepy conservative comedian ben stein is coming soon to a theatre near you _meta_end_dot_

 the title expelled no intelligence allowed refers to the film s primary line of attack that scientists and educators have been unfairly persecuted for speaking out against evolutionary biology or as the film so deliciously calls it darwin ism _meta_end_dot_

 the movie reportedly and predictably lurches along for _meta_number_ref_ vapid minutes from one intellectual travesty to another brimming with the imagined persecution and a sample box of traditional creationist candied nuts with plenty of time leftover to blame a wide range of ugly episodes in human history on evolutionary biology _meta_end_dot_

 any semblance of reality is purely coincidental _meta_end_dot_

 of course teachers and scientists can speak out in public on blogs or street corners just like anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter they can and have run for all kinds of elected office successfully at times on a creationist platform _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for a medical researcher who thinks illness is a product of parasitic alien souls or a history teacher who believes native americans descend from a hebrew clan that sailed to america _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the only time a teacher might draw professional criticism over that kind of stuff is if and when despite repeated warnings in most cases they ignore applicable law or stated school policy and or stray wildly from defined curricula and observed facts and persist in exploiting their position by endlessly pushing their personal religious convictions on students or peers _meta_end_dot_
