  happy winter or summer as the case may be _meta_end_exclamation_

 the northern winter solstice occurred just a few hours ago dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am edt _meta_end_dot_

 that means today will be about the shortest day of the year and tonight a long glorious reign of winter darkness _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t mean that the sun rose at the latest time this morning or that it will set at the earliest later today _meta_end_dot_

 and now if you haven t heard this odd astronomical tale already you re puzzled how could the shortest day of the year not feature the latest sunrise and or earliest sunset _meta_end_question_

 the key is they don t happen on the same day of the year otherwise yes we d have a problem _meta_end_dot_

 the reason has to do with the solar day vs _meta_end_dot_

 the actual day and a bunch of precise time keeping sky staring records that only geeks and _meta_number_ref_th century ship captains cared much about _meta_end_dot_

 but for a more intuitive explanation we live on a sphere its axis is tilted with respect to our orbit around the sun and as kepler first found much to his initial horror that orbit isn t a perfect circle it s an ellipse _meta_end_dot_

 what all that means is if you recorded where the sun was in the sky everyday at exactly the same time of day over the course of one year it would make a funky lopsided slanting figure eight pattern in the sky like this _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom of that pattern would mark the sun s positions through the onset of winter _meta_end_dot_

 but the sun doesn t just move north and south to trace out that pattern over a year it also has to move east and west _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a combination of those tiny sideways and east west changes near the winter solstice that determine on what date of the year you will see your local earliest sunset and same for the latest sunrise _meta_end_dot_

 here in the us the earliest sunset precedes the solstice by about two weeks and the latest sunrise comes a couple of weeks after _meta_end_dot_

 if running naked while on mind altering substances under the stars and baying to the crystal clear night sky and really who can honestly say they ve never done it on the solstice is important to your beliefs you could pick no better date to practice the bizarre rituals fascinating traditional beliefs of your savage bronze aged faithful pioneering forefathers than the evening of dec _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the moon is full and there ll be a bright rusty spark costarring next to luna but it s not a star nor is it rudolph s red nose _meta_end_dot_

 the red planet mars now improved with a suspected active glacier will not be higher and brighter in the night sky until the year _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and next month there is a small but growing chance mars will be struck by a _meta_number_ref_ meter wide space rock which would produce quite an impact about _meta_number_ref_ megatons worth _meta_end_dot_
