  the traditional media s insipid love affair with john mccain reached new depths this weekend when a cnn reporter rushed to his defense against wait for it a high school student who heckled him by asking a question _meta_end_dot_

 it was all started by that awful horrible katelyn halldorson _meta_end_dot_

 you ll remember that bad girl katelyn grabbed a microphone or something and like flamed john to his face at his old private high school in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 john was all like back off yeah ok so it was compulsory _meta_end_dot_

 and it was a campaign speech sure _meta_end_dot_

 but still who did katelyn think she was asking a really long question _meta_end_question_

 fortunately cnn s jim acosta wasn t going to stand by and just let her wail on john _meta_end_dot_

 heckling _meta_end_question_

 she wasn t heckling john _meta_end_dot_

 she had him pinned down with hostile fire _meta_end_dot_

 she was practically mauling him _meta_end_dot_

 john s only chance of rescue was for intrepid journalists to infiltrate behind enemy lines and extract him at great risk to themselves from the maw of mild criticism _meta_end_dot_

 and so it goes with our pathetic news media _meta_end_dot_

 every time our hero gets into political trouble journalists can be found to succor mccain from himself _meta_end_dot_

 only three weeks ago he came in for ridicule for claiming falsely that iran was backing al qaeda a claim mccain had already made multiple times as it turned out _meta_end_dot_

 it exposed mccain s cluelessness about his signature issue iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but he could count on cnn to rush to his rescue _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer went so far as to air an edited tape of mccain s latest blunder as if the goal was to persuade viewers that our hero quickly corrected his misstatement _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t an isolated incident _meta_end_dot_

 quite the opposite we saw that reporters regularly and confidently presented that incident as a verbal miscue a mere slip of the tongue ignoring all the other times mccain had made the same preposterous claim _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 it s partly because to report the plain truth that mccain is grossly ignorant even in areas where he claims expertise would tend to disqualify him for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 too many journalists have imbibed the bizarre wisdom that reporting should not actually exert any influence on its subject matter _meta_end_dot_

 so if the truth about mccain would destroy his campaign then it s unfair to tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but there s much more at work as well _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast to their often catty treatment of the democratic candidates journalists have attached nearly homeric attributes to mccain maverick straight talk war hero that inform their stories about him _meta_end_dot_

 john of the loud war cry can almost do no wrong in their eyes and reporters love to draw unfavorable contrasts to the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the wright scandal is a perfect example _meta_end_dot_

 the loud gnashing of teeth that wright s idiotic comments evoked was accompanied by something closer to journalistic silence regarding mccain s spiritual guide neo crusader rod parsley and the equally crazy bigot whose benediction mccain eagerly sought out john hagee _meta_end_dot_

 and with the help of journalists doing likewise i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pretty stunning demonstration of how reporters shield mccain from criticism given how vile hagee is _meta_end_dot_

 here s an unusually obnoxious example of the journalists mccain syndrome from the height depths of the wright scandal _meta_end_dot_

 a folksy patriotic pastor what s not to love _meta_end_question_

 bet he s the kind of guy journalists could count on to help infiltrate enemy lines and bring captain mccain back alive _meta_end_dot_
