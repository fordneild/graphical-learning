  the washington post has picked up on our frustration with debbie wasserman schultz i should note of course that it s not just the netroots who are up in arms over this local democratic leaders in south florida are furious too _meta_end_dot_

 the dccc s executive director however totally dismisses the concerns of both groups it may be customary but it s dead wrong and rahm emanuel fought tooth and nail against that decrepit lazy philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 once upon a time even debbie wasserman schultz herself did too _meta_end_dot_

 it s sad to see a proud strong organization like the dccc resign itself to tolerating this sort of absenteeism _meta_end_dot_

 i have to imagine rahm s heart aches to see this _meta_end_dot_

 debbie for her part accuses us of getting things wrong of course we never accused her of formally endorsing any republican _meta_end_dot_

 we have however laid out a clear bill of particulars debbie wasserman schultz is allegedly frustrated with us bloggers and wants us off her back i can only assume this applies to the unhappy local dems in s _meta_end_dot_

 fla too but if she really cared what we think she or a staffer could have easily reached out to the netroots _meta_end_dot_

 wolff s dismissive statement makes it pretty clear that we re seen as just a minor nuisance _meta_end_dot_

 so it s time we made our voices heard _meta_end_dot_

 if you have a problem with the co chair of the red to blue program saying she won t campaign for our excellent democratic candidates annette taddeo joe garcia raul martinez please let her and the dccc know about it _meta_end_dot_

 whatever you say or write i urge you to be firm but exceedingly polite _meta_end_dot_

 our message is strong and true we don t need to cloud our cause by giving those in power an easy out to attack the messenger _meta_end_dot_

 and what are we asking for _meta_end_question_

 we want debbie wasserman schultz to vocally endorse our south florida trio and do everything she can to help them get elected including hosting a fundraiser for each _meta_end_dot_

 if she won t do that then we d like her to resign from red to blue _meta_end_dot_

 and we also want the dccc to stop tolerating members of congress who want to remain neutral in contested races _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz campaign office askdebbie dwsforcongress com dccc chair chris van hollen campaign office chris vanhollen org dccc headquarters contact form please do not contact congressional offices as this is purely a political issue _meta_end_dot_

 just keep in mind what we re fighting for be polite and let s remind the folks in charge that our opinions matter _meta_end_dot_
