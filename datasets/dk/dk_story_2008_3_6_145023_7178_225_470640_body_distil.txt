  susa did some pretty kick ass polling of all _meta_number_ref_ states matching up hillary clinton and barack obama against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the results _meta_end_question_

 they both do it differently _meta_end_dot_

 clinton obama let s look at some notable states it s amazing how many non swing states will suddenly be well swing states this year like texas south carolina and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 some of these states become competitive depending on the candidate like arkansas and tennessee for clinton and just about everything west of the mississippi for obama _meta_end_dot_

 and you may be wondering why i included states like montana wyoming utah and idaho in this list since both candidates get crushed _meta_end_dot_

 well because we ll have important races in those states at the house and senate level as well as state level races _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear that in those states and many others like it obama will be a dramatic help at the top of the ticket versus clinton who will play the traditional role of top of the ticket albatross _meta_end_dot_

 in all obama outperforms clinton in _meta_number_ref_ states alaska arizona california colorado connecticut delaware georgia hawaii idaho illinois indiana iowa maine maryland michigan minnesota montana nebraska nevada new hampshire new mexico north carolina north dakota oregon south carolina south dakota texas utah vermont virginia washington wisconsin and wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 clinton outperforms obama in _meta_number_ref_ states alabama arkansas florida kentucky louisiana massachusetts mississippi missouri new jersey new york oklahoma pennsylvania rhode island tennessee and west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 they are even in kansas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 now new jersey washington and maybe even pennsylvania are teases to the gop _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to consider flipping then never do _meta_end_dot_

 obama getting north dakota is so implausible that i d never count on it _meta_end_dot_

 ohio gives obama and clinton even numbers so the notion that her victory there makes her more electable there is pretty silly _meta_end_dot_

 the same way that obama winning missouri doesn t make him more electable in that state _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it s one poll _meta_end_dot_

 and if polls are correct _meta_percent_ref_ of the time which is standard then we have to assume by definition that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of these are off _meta_end_dot_

 so take with all the appropriate grains of salt _meta_end_dot_
