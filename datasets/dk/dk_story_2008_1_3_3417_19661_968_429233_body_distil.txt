  so welcome to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 seems like everyone is taking stock looking back at _meta_number_ref_ and gazing into their respective crystal balls to predict what this year might hold _meta_end_dot_

 the international atomic energy agency is no exception _meta_end_dot_

 they ve issued a staff report _meta_number_ref_ year in review looking back on nuclear s future which is chock full of obscure news like an update on reports of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials as well as bigger headline makers like addressing the complex issue of nuclear fuel and proliferation risks _meta_end_dot_

 of course the bush administration cannot hear the word nuclear without immediately frothing at the mouth and saying iran with almost complete disregard for any other critical international nuclear issues _meta_end_dot_

 one of these issues is north korea the country that actually made and tested a nuclear bomb in _meta_number_ref_ although it was very small and basically a fizzle not a bang it was less than a kiloton _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration immediately scrambled and scheduled a press conference _meta_end_dot_

 they came up with a few good we weren t asleep at the switch really we weren t statements condensed by fox news into press conferences for dummies captions _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 north korea s nuclear timeline has been a rocky road but a breakthrough was made in march _meta_number_ref_ when an iaea delegation arrived in north korea by invitation _meta_end_dot_

 it had been five years since the iaea had been in north korea so this was indeed a historic event _meta_end_dot_

 talks continued in june and by july _meta_number_ref_ the iaea had confirmed that all reactors at yongbyong had been shut down _meta_end_dot_

 katie mounts a policy associate at the nonproliferation and national security think tank council for a livable world summed up the diplomatic successes nicely but the saga is by no means over and is far from simple _meta_end_dot_

 north korea had until december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to completely declare its nuclear programs as well as disable its facilities in a timely manner _meta_end_dot_

 from jeff lewis at arms control wonk needless to say if history is any indicator talks with north korea regarding its nuclear program will certainly be something the next president of the united states will have to deal with _meta_end_dot_

 the nonpartisan council on foreign relations has a nice summary of each candidate s position on north korea s nuclear program it s from october but is still relevant _meta_end_dot_

 what is noteworthy is that most of the republican candidates have only soundbites mike huckabee doesn t even have a stance and the democratic candidates have firm convictions and non military proposals _meta_end_dot_

 in conclusion the future is still somewhat murky for example verification of north korea s plutonium is anything but a simple process _meta_end_dot_

 but what john bolton called pyongyang pussyfooting is what i call diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 it s obvious what works best isn t it _meta_end_question_

 we ve made a lot of progress in a year _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope things continue to move in the right direction _meta_end_dot_
