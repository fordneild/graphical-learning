  rudy giuliani s campaign is in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 first it was a dismal _meta_number_ref_th place finish in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 then it was an embarrassing _meta_number_ref_th place finish in new hampshire in which giuliani was barely able to squeak out _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 to put that in perspective john edwards who placed _meta_number_ref_rd amongst democrats in nh still received almost more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ times as many votes as giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 now comes word that he has asked his top staffers to forgo their paychecks for the month of january and possibly beyond _meta_end_dot_

 oh yea i m sure they voluntarily gave up their paychecks to work for the noble cause of making rudy president _meta_end_dot_

 anyway you slice it this can t be good for rudy _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope floridians have the good sense to send him back to the hamptons for good _meta_end_dot_

 update hahaha_meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_hahaha_meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_haha _meta_end_exclamation_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ loserrific _meta_end_exclamation_
