  for the second time in two months a vote to override george bush s veto of health care for four million children has failed today by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 forty two republicans voted with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that this bill has passed in the senate by a veto proof majority _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ republicans and one democrat jim marshall decided to once again kow tow to george bush while ignoring the more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the american people who favor this bill invoking scary brown people and socialized medicine to justify their votes _meta_end_dot_

 and the democrats are more than happy to let them do so again and again as demfromct said earlier today bring it on _meta_end_dot_
