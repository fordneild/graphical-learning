  who s best on policy _meta_end_question_

 the policy differences between all the democrats really are tiny to irrelevant since none of their plans will survive first contact with congress _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i d rather these candidates shoot for the sky and give us a vision of what their ideal society would look like rather than compromise with themselves right off the gate _meta_end_dot_

 why is single payer off the agenda for most of these candidates _meta_end_question_

 they want to talk about what s realistic but what s realistic really depends on what congress looks like and what the american people are demanding when any given legislation hits the docket _meta_end_dot_

 who s showing leadership _meta_end_question_

 outside of chris dodd who sadly never gained traction we have a whole field of candidates who like to talk about leadership but none that have shown us what that leadership might look like _meta_end_dot_

 too bad _meta_end_dot_

 that would ve been a great way to help winnow the field _meta_end_dot_

 lucky for them all none of the top candidates have given us a demonstration in leadership _meta_end_dot_

 unlucky for us _meta_end_dot_

 the country could ve used some real leadership in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 who is playing to win _meta_end_question_

 winning is important _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing we can afford as a country is another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years of continued republican rule _meta_end_dot_

 if nothing else justice stevens is not long on the bench and losing his vote in the supreme court would inflict the nation with a solid conservative majority for generations _meta_end_dot_

 so who is doing everything possible to win _meta_end_question_

 hillary clinton by far _meta_end_dot_

 she s not limiting her campaign s ability to raise money nor her supporters to give it by accepting public financing _meta_end_dot_

 obama has opted out for the primary but has said he d accept it for the general if the republican did so as well _meta_end_dot_

 why give republicans veto power over what the democrats do _meta_end_question_

 given our better ability to raise money this cycle why would obama willingly surrender that advantage to the republicans _meta_end_question_

 that s not playing to win _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is the opposite saying he could opt out of public financing for the general but already opted in for the primary _meta_end_dot_

 that means that unless he s opposite a similarly limited republican i e _meta_end_dot_

 mccain he ll be at a gross disadvantage all summer as he has less than _meta_dollor_ref_ million left to spend until september _meta_end_dot_

 what s more clinton was the only top tier candidate to refuse the ultimate iowa and new hampshire pander by removing her name from the michigan ballot _meta_end_dot_

 that makes her essentially the de facto winner since edwards and obama caving to the cry babies in iowa and new hampshire took their name off michigan s ballot _meta_end_dot_

 sure the dnc has stripped michigan of its delegates but that won t last through the convention _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing democrats can afford is to alienate swing states like michigan and florida by refusing to seat their delegates _meta_end_dot_

 so while obama and edwards kneecap their chances of winning clinton is single mindedly focused on the goal _meta_end_dot_

 who is tested against the right wing smear machine _meta_end_question_

 clinton by far _meta_end_dot_

 no one has taken more shit from the vrwc not by a long shot _meta_end_dot_

 edwards earned valuable campaign experience in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it makes me wonder why he d go through it all again a second time but still it s something _meta_end_dot_

 obama has never had a competitive race against a republican _meta_end_dot_

 his best experiences comes from winning primaries _meta_end_dot_

 but he s never been in the crossfires of the gop _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s why he can pretend that he can move beyond partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 because he s never had to run a partisan race _meta_end_dot_

 who is the best defender of progressive ideals _meta_end_question_

 edwards by a landslide _meta_end_dot_

 not the _meta_number_ref_ edition but the new and improved _meta_number_ref_ model _meta_end_dot_

 from a rhetorical standpoint no one has come close to articulating the nation s ills and why progressive solutions are the best salve _meta_end_dot_

 this is important democrats have been poor at branding their ideology thus ceding that ground to demonizing conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 long term our movement cannot survive another bill clinton someone more interested in making david broder and joe klein happy with triangulating rhetoric that undermines rather than bolsters progressive values and policies _meta_end_dot_

 clinton isn t horrible on this front but obama has made a cottage industry out of attacking the dirty fucking hippies on the left from labor unions to paul krugman to gore and kerry to social security and so on _meta_end_dot_

 people think i was being ticky tack with the gore thing and in isolation it would ve been but a minor non event _meta_end_dot_

 but it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel s back for me yet another in a pattern of attacks against democrats and their constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 he is the return of bill clinton style triangulating personified _meta_end_dot_

 now i m willing to consider that this is all a front and that he d govern as progressively as bush governed conservatively after his _meta_number_ref_ bullshit about being a uniter and compassionate _meta_end_dot_

 he can even pull a bush i suppose and claim a mandate on policies he blurred or ignored on the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve seen how a lack of true mandate has crushed bush s presidency and made him the most unpopular and least effective president in history _meta_end_dot_

 i d rather have our candidate elected promising progressive reform especially in a year where the american people seem to crave such solutions _meta_end_dot_

 then again i do like that obama has frozen out fox news as has edwards i think _meta_end_dot_

 i wish clinton would do so as well but her weird flirtation with rupert murdoch apparently precludes that _meta_end_dot_

 the story and likability _meta_end_question_

 i actually like all the candidates even hillary _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like the people she surrounds herself with like the union busting mark penn but i like her personally _meta_end_dot_

 and i like obama and his story and i like edwards and his story _meta_end_dot_

 i like the fact that being a white male puts edwards at a disadvantage _meta_end_dot_

 it shows we re progressing and that people are craving a more tangible symbol of that progress a woman or african american president _meta_end_dot_

 as a latino i was desperately hoping i could get behind bill richardson s campaign but that one came up short in so many different areas that it wasn t to be _meta_end_dot_

 but i like richardson as well _meta_end_dot_

 politicians rarely get this high by being public assholes at least on the democratic side _meta_end_dot_

 in other words i d have a beer with any of them _meta_end_dot_

 but i do love the idea of breaking a new barrier this year whether it s by having a woman president or an african american one _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line _meta_end_question_

 given the minor differences in policy and the vast gap between them and the chamber of horrors the gop has put forth i ll be satisfied with any of these candidates as my nominee _meta_end_dot_

 none of them rock my world there are no true people powered candidates in our field the only one is ron paul on the other side _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the fault line _meta_end_question_

 the desire to win important and the ability and willingness to unapologetically articulate progressive solutions to our nation s problems _meta_end_dot_

 hillary wins the former and edwards the latter _meta_end_dot_

 i d love to see a barrier broken to provide a tangible sign of our progress as a society even pakistan has had a woman prime minister _meta_end_dot_

 with all those factors in play with no obvious gate crashing people powered candidate and with what really is solid field i m left firmly in the undecided camp _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t mind being there since thankfully i don t have to cast a vote on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 update while mccain has qualified for federal matching funds apparently he hasn t officially accepted them _meta_end_dot_
