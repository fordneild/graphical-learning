  i submit the following these are broad generalizations no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 but i think there s a lot of truth to them truth which can teach us about ourselves about the traditional media and about the relationship between us _meta_end_dot_

 i think i m on pretty safe ground when i say that science reporters love science _meta_end_dot_

 they thrill to the genome the hubble deep field exobiology exoplanetology the large hadron collider stem cells schroedinger hawking wiles lake vostok and coral reefs _meta_end_dot_

 love of the subject is why they went into science reporting in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 and a love of the subject is i don t doubt why science bloggers write about the topics they do _meta_end_dot_

 i think that makes for a lot of common ground between science bloggers and science reporters _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that science reporters don t face their fare share of criticism here you have one reporter who doesn t debunk intelligent design sternly enough here another who doesn t think educating the public about flu epidemics is in his job description _meta_end_dot_

 but in the end i have to imagine that if you hosted a conference for science reporters and bloggers they d have a damn good time together swapping stories trading jokes _meta_end_dot_

 and that s because they are passionate about the same things _meta_end_dot_

 so too with sports _meta_end_dot_

 sports reporters delight at the crack of the bat the the triple the triple double the hat trick the trick play the hail mary the home run record musial mikita marino the perfect bunt and the perfect game _meta_end_dot_

 of course sports reporters chose their profession out of love of the subject _meta_end_dot_

 and the passionate sports fans who become sports bloggers same thing _meta_end_dot_

 once again there s always the knuckle headed reporter who insists that ops is newfangled non sense or the embarrassing homer who can t bring himself to criticize the local team _meta_end_dot_

 but again if you rented out the bleachers for a crowd of sports reporters and bloggers they d have a hell of a time at the game together swapping stories trading jokes _meta_end_dot_

 but oh the political reporters _meta_end_dot_

 they are a breed apart _meta_end_dot_

 they like politics as theater hillary s pantsuit obama s turban the clenis the flight suit america s mayor dead or alive he said she said and all the world s a stage _meta_end_dot_

 but they hate what we identify as politics winning elections because they matter ensuring our judiciary respects the constitution passing legislation to help the disadvantaged the middle class the environment the world _meta_end_dot_

 they hate all this because our brand of politics is about caring and there is nothing more un cool more gauche more unacceptable than caring _meta_end_dot_

 like the astrophysics geek of course or the armchair sabermetrician we politi philes are nerds at heart nerds who care about our chosen subject and nerds who care about outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 i think we all know that political reporters on the other hand are the ultimate post ironic kool kidz snickering in the corner at us propeller heads who wear our hearts on our sleeves _meta_end_dot_

 sports writers understand that in the end what they write about really almost always is just a game _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that political reporters think the same way about their beat as well _meta_end_dot_

 and this i think explains the antagonistic view many political reporters have toward bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 i think it almost boggles their minds that there are people out there normal ordinary people who care about politics and aren t paid to do so _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we despise the maureen dowd style obsessions shared by such a wide swath of the political reporting class and we have a hard time respecting anyone who doesn t take politics as seriously as we do _meta_end_dot_

 put another way political reporters hate what we love and love what we hate _meta_end_dot_

 this stands in stark contrast to the science and sports worlds examples which i picked in part because these are other interests of mine but also because i think they are good stand ins for just about any other topics _meta_end_dot_

 sports science reporters bloggers have plenty in common political reporters and bloggers share little _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure though that political reporters could really have any other m o _meta_end_dot_

 the twentieth century invention of objective reporting all but prohibits reporters from caring about political outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 this means that the kind of people attracted to political reporting almost necessarily have to find politics appealing only as some sort of grand kabuki _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t always this way the slavish obeisance to objectivity replaced what used to be sharp elbowed partisanship in american print media _meta_end_dot_

 but could our frayed modus vivendi with the political press corps actually be preferable to the alternative _meta_end_question_

 in a future essay i ll take a look at an illustrative episode from an earlier and very different media era and then you can decide _meta_end_dot_
