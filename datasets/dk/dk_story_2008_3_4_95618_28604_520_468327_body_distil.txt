  so on sunday the washington post featured charlotte allen generalizing from her own characteristics to argue that women are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 it s difficult to find anything to say that hasn t already been said in at least one of the dozens of blogospheric smackdowns including an open thread one by kos well i should say it s difficult for a mere woman to come up with much _meta_end_dot_

 there s jill filipovic s take on the details of the argument but the sheer stupidity of the op ed is not the story here _meta_end_dot_

 the story is that the washington fucking post printed it and then tried to pass it off as a joke _meta_end_dot_

 jessica valenti and jane hamsher point out that allen is a professional anti feminist misogynist homophobe racist which sort of belies the whole joke claim _meta_end_dot_

 wapo outlook section editor james pomfret expects us to believe that in the spirit of comedy he gave space to someone with a history of quite seriously attacking women _meta_end_question_

 yeah right _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that he thinks all his readers not just the women are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 which makes him stupid and i m wondering if someone smart maybe a man could let me know if the logical extension of that is that he s a woman because i m getting confused _meta_end_dot_

 here you ll have to just imagine me giggling and batting my eyelashes _meta_end_dot_

 sorry bout that anyway kieran healy explains why pomfret would choose a woman as a vehicle for misogyny as steve benen and ezra klein emphasize it s important not to allow pomfret and his fellow editors to imagine that the response to allen involves taking the piece itself seriously _meta_end_dot_

 if this had been published by the independent women s forum or the weekly standard half of the bloggers who have written about it would never have known it existed and few of those who heard about it would have written anything _meta_end_dot_

 who cares if winger publications say winger things _meta_end_question_

 this is a story because it was in the washington post a newspaper that s supposed to know better than to publish something that manages to be so laughably insanely bad on the way to making an offensive argument _meta_end_dot_

 what about the precedent when this newspaper runs a piece that offends people _meta_end_question_

 laura rozen although we might take from this that the washington post s official policy is that it s more ok to insult and offend women than jewish people it seems that the policy is open to change with pomfret now expressing a little more regret albeit still with lame excuses about provoking rather than offending and the classic sorry if it offended you move _meta_end_dot_

 clearly this is a man with significant judgment and professionalism issues _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if deborah howell does any better on sunday _meta_end_dot_

 but really should we have had to expend so many words to get to that point _meta_end_question_
