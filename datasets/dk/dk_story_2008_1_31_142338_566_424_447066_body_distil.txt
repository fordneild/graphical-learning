  for the past few months david goldstein aka goldy has kindly given one hour of his sunday night radio show over to daily kos hosting daily kos contributing editors and guests _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday goldy got the news that he along with other local talk show hosts were being fired _meta_end_dot_

 from his post at his blog horsesass org here s where media consolidation hits home _meta_end_dot_

 there isn t another venue providing that kind of local programming and it s not just washington state or seattle that s being hit _meta_end_dot_

 but that s a topic for another day _meta_end_dot_

 today it s about goldy and letting _meta_number_ref_ kiro and its parent company bonneville international know that we value local and progressive voices in talk radio _meta_end_dot_

 our friends at the nw progressive institute have written an open letter to kiro s management and have more info in this diary _meta_end_dot_

 on a personal note and on behalf of the daily kos team i want to thank goldy for opening up the airwaves and the bandwidth to us _meta_end_dot_

 i would provide links to the archives of the shows we ve appeared on but they ve apparently been scrubbed from kiro s site _meta_end_dot_

 but i m speaking for all of us when i say it s been a lot of fun to work with you david and i hope that we can find a way to continue _meta_end_dot_
