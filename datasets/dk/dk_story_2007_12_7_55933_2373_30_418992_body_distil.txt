  you know what i wish _meta_end_question_

 i wish the congress to shout out their support for habeas grab bush and cheney by the arms and parade them out of d c _meta_end_dot_

 with their joe btfsplk clouds trailing behind _meta_end_dot_

 i wish cold fusion worked _meta_end_dot_

 i wish i had a million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 i wish i was too young to remember joe btfsplk _meta_end_dot_

 but what with the national shortage of magical wishing genies i wish barbra eden would always look like she did in _meta_number_ref_ saturday evenings at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ central i m not likely to get any of those things _meta_end_dot_

 but i m hoping i will get an energy bill _meta_end_dot_

 if you d asked me a month ago i would have told you i wasn t excited about this bill _meta_end_dot_

 this was a vote i wasn t even thinking about _meta_end_dot_

 the draft bill looked more like a announcement of good intentions just something to get out the door so that you could go back to constituents in time for election _meta_number_ref_ and say yup we passed us an energy bill like a lot of people i was already looking past this round thinking of what we could pass next year with an expanded democratic majority and a democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 and then nancy pelosi surprised me _meta_end_dot_

 with skilled negotiation she built this bill up into something that could really make a difference _meta_end_dot_

 is it perfect _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 the new cafe standards include the same categories that the industry used to hide thirsty vehicles in the last round _meta_end_dot_

 the biofuels bit is still probably more of a gift to big agriculture than a slight to big oil _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t directly confront the worst damage that coal mining is doing to our nation _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a good bill _meta_end_dot_

 a gutsy bill _meta_end_dot_

 there are those new cafe standards that would require _meta_percent_ref_ improvements in fuel efficiency for vehicles by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even it s not structured exactly as i like getting this out of the house with any cafe requirements is a big change _meta_end_dot_

 there are no oil subsidies in this bill _meta_end_dot_

 that means _meta_dollor_ref_ billion dollars in gifts that were being shipped to the richest companies on the planet can now be turned toward cleaner forms of energy _meta_end_dot_

 that s huge _meta_end_dot_

 there are new standards in this bill to improve efficiency of home appliances and reduce energy use at home _meta_end_dot_

 where is our biggest energy sink _meta_end_question_

 not on the roads _meta_end_dot_

 not in factories _meta_end_dot_

 right at home folks _meta_end_dot_

 low power appliances and improved home energy use are vital _meta_end_dot_

 there are improved incentives for both hybrid and fully electric vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 this has been expanded and restructured so that hybrids are no longer punished for success _meta_end_dot_

 for me this could be the biggest win in the bill as it s done in a way that really rewards good behavior _meta_end_dot_

 there are new requirements that every utility in the country get _meta_percent_ref_ of their power from renewable sources _meta_end_dot_

 the importance of this can t be overstated _meta_end_dot_

 that s an enormous increase in renewable energy _meta_end_dot_

 is it enough _meta_end_question_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 but it s much much more than we re getting now _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough to cause a revolution in power generation and spur new development of solar wind biofuels _meta_end_dot_

 you name it _meta_end_dot_

 last night an oil tanker wrecked off the coast of south korea _meta_end_dot_

 last month there was an extremely destructive spill in san francisco bay _meta_end_dot_

 and while that spill was happening another spill ten times as large was going on in russia _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday our nation imported nearly _meta_number_ref_ million barrels of oil _meta_end_dot_

 within five years most of the vehicles on the road will be new vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 those vehicles can be better if we pass this bill _meta_end_dot_

 last year in the united states _meta_number_ref_ coal miners lost their lives in the mines while thousands more suffer from black lung _meta_end_dot_

 failing coal impoundments dumped millions of gallons of toxic sludge into our streams and rivers as hundreds of mountains were destroyed for all time _meta_end_dot_

 emissions from coal powered plants dumped six thousand tons of mercury into our water and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion tons of co_meta_number_ref_ into our air _meta_end_dot_

 right now there are enough coal powered plants in the planning stage that it would increase co_meta_number_ref_ emissions to over _meta_number_ref_ billion tons _meta_end_dot_

 we can reduce that if we add renewables instead of coal _meta_end_dot_

 for a more detailed look at this bill you can see the excellent diaries already done by chapter_meta_number_ref_ the cunctator and a siegel _meta_end_dot_

 the most important thing i can say now is to call your senator and express support for this bill _meta_end_dot_

 yes that includes republican senators _meta_end_dot_

 in fact especially republican senators _meta_end_dot_

 i really wish you would _meta_end_dot_
