  it nearly beggars belief that we have a supreme court justice who d seek to justify torture but that is exactly what antonin scalia did in a bbc interview aired yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 original intent scalia doesn t seem to care that george washington took an unequivocal stance against torturing captured prisoners during the young republic s struggle for survival at a time when the enemy were abusing american captives right and left _meta_end_dot_

 no more does scalia give a damn about the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments _meta_end_dot_

 that he told the bbc applies to people only once they ve been convicted of a crime _meta_end_dot_

 according to scalia if you re awaiting trial or just plain hoping to get a trial someday then maybe anything goes _meta_end_dot_

 yes siree in scalia s bizarro world you gain the protection of law by right of being convicted _meta_end_dot_

 the fifth amendment s guarantee of due process _meta_end_question_

 that little matter of the presumption of innocence the very foundation of our system of criminal law _meta_end_question_

 pfffttt _meta_end_dot_

 actually come to mention it what we ve got is not so much a legal system as a nielsen profile of supreme court justices tv viewing habits _meta_end_dot_

 and you can t rule out the possibility that this season s plot twists will need to involve some torture just a wee tad _meta_end_dot_

 or for that matter any number of potential scenarios have these punks been racing hot rods lately let s see if the handyman knows who the burglers are what cha say we beat the crap out of that bum over there in fact it s far from clear that any such confessions in scalia s world would be treated as poisonous fruit _meta_end_dot_

 if only the courts are willing to apply scalia s ends justify the means test definitively enunciated in jack bauer v _meta_end_dot_

 the world they ll be able to justify almost any governmental activities _meta_end_dot_

 just so long as officials don t call the torture punishment they re in the clear _meta_end_dot_

 presumably that explains why scalia sees no need to take too seriously the federal torture statute or international treaties _meta_end_dot_

 geneva conventions _meta_end_question_

 pfffttt _meta_end_dot_

 the un convention on torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment _meta_end_question_

 double pfffttt _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be interested to learn that notwithstanding his embrace of torture there are indeed limits to what antonin scalia will tolerate _meta_end_dot_

 the practice of televising court proceedings he told the bbc is sick _meta_end_dot_
