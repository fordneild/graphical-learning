  promoted by dhinmi disclosure i am volunteering out of the robin weirauch for congress campaign headquarters in bowling green _meta_end_dot_

 polls are open here until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_pm so there s three hours till polls close _meta_end_dot_

 the verdict so far _meta_end_question_

 because of the weather we believe turnout is low _meta_end_dot_

 but nobody knows if that is good or bad _meta_end_dot_

 it s doubly important that if you know anybody living in the district you call them now and ask them to go vote for robin _meta_end_dot_

 if you re on facebook you can use this event to invite your friends and family to go vote _meta_end_dot_

 but a personal phone call is probably best _meta_end_dot_

 the weather is pretty uniformly bad _meta_end_dot_

 it s been raining or misting or about to rain all day _meta_end_dot_

 at least it isn t icy out _meta_end_dot_

 supposed to be in the upper _meta_number_ref_s for the rest of the day _meta_end_dot_

 ohio daily blog and buckeye state blog have been offering up great coverage all day be sure to go read their posts _meta_end_dot_

 for results tonight check out the sos website _meta_end_dot_
