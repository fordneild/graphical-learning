  politico but _meta_end_dot_

 emanuel has a point here and it s not a minor one _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also not an answer to the problem _meta_end_dot_

 a loss in court could indeed have a negative impact on the ability of future congresses to investigate the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what _meta_end_question_

 so could ignoring the problem and hoping it ll go away on its own _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s not a matter of whether it could happen that way _meta_end_dot_

 it is happening that way _meta_end_dot_

 ignoring the problem and holding on in the hopes that we ll elect a democratic president in november just means that the ability of future congresses to investigate the executive branch depends not on the congress independently possessing this prerogative but rather on the election of presidents who would opt not to make obstruction of congressional oversight white house policy _meta_end_dot_

 if the federal courts are also of the opinion that the congress has no constitutional authority to conduct oversight and so provide checks and balances against the executive branch better to get that on the table sooner rather than later _meta_end_dot_

 without knowing the state of the law a democratic administration is hamstrung in exercising its discretion in the appointment of judges _meta_end_dot_

 if the federal judiciary is so rife with conservative partisans that they d effectively be able to nullify the power of democratic congressional oversight at will isn t that something we d want the next democratic president to know and consider in his or her approach to judiciary nominations _meta_end_question_

 not according to rahm emanuel i guess _meta_end_dot_

 though in fairness nobody has ever asked him this question quite this way as far as i know _meta_end_dot_

 the comment section is right down there rahm _meta_end_dot_

 get an account if you have an answer for us _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile emanuel s position puts him at odds not only with pelosi but also with judiciary chairman john conyers who has been pushing hard for this vote for months now and with an extraordinary collection of his fellow democrats from all quarters who ve been whipping members on this critical issue including brad miller linda sanchez adam schiff and steve cohen _meta_end_dot_

 that s no band of dirty f ing hippies folks _meta_end_dot_

 and here s another consideration the contempt vote was last postponed in order to avoid poisoning the atmosphere of bipartisan cooperation cough cough supposedly necessary for the passage of the economic stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 with that out of the way the stage is apparently set for this more confrontational issue _meta_end_dot_

 but the house is also now wrapped up in the fisa issue where the pressure is increasing for them to stand firm behind their already passed restore act rather than agree to go along with the horrible rockefeller backed betrayal passed by the senate _meta_end_dot_

 will the house panic and back off of the contempt vote again for fear that confrontations on both fisa and contempt at the same time is simply too much to bear _meta_end_question_

 quite possibly _meta_end_dot_

 here it might be time to borrow a page from the white house playbook and pursue a flood the zone strategy _meta_end_dot_

 when the white house has multiple outrages to perpetrate as is so often the case it does so in overwhelming waves with no mind paid to pacing or any insistence on decent intervals in between _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the strategy seems to be to flood the public the media and the democratic opposition with everything it can throw at them all at once _meta_end_dot_

 and each time they ve done it the national media have been for the most part unable or uninterested in keeping up _meta_end_dot_

 light five fires at once and four go relatively unnoticed _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps it s time to bring out all the grievances against the executive now roiling beneath the surface inside the congress _meta_end_dot_

 why not deal with contempt at the same time as we hopefully fight on fisa _meta_end_question_

 and why not encourage the senate to add its pending contempt votes to the pile as well _meta_end_question_

 and why not get down to issuing subpoenas aimed at the administration s stonewalling on questions surrounding the missing e mails _meta_end_question_

 the destruction of the torture tapes _meta_end_question_

 the withholding of key documents and testimony by the department of education _meta_end_question_

 by nasa _meta_end_question_

 in fact by virtually every department of the executive branch that s been asked to comply with congressional oversight over the past several years _meta_end_question_

 if george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s judiciary is ready to validate all of this perhaps that s something the public would like to know heading into the next election _meta_end_dot_

 let s get at least some of this the most egregious parts anyway out on the table _meta_end_dot_

 let s face it something s got to be on that table _meta_end_dot_

 the house rules committee is meeting at this hour to consider how to bring them to the floor _meta_end_dot_
