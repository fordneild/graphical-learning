  it s a bit pathetic seeing hillary clinton s campaign desperately trying to attach significance to her florida victory and she s pinned those efforts on the claim that obama broke a pledge to campaign in the state by running a national ad that just so happened run in florida given that the state is part of our nation _meta_end_dot_

 so are iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina and the ad ran in those four states despite the fact that they ve already had their primaries and caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 when you run a national ad the whole point is that it runs from coast to coast and everywhere in between _meta_end_dot_

 you can t take out states otherwise it s no longer national _meta_end_dot_

 we can argue the merits of running a national ad campaign in a system that is based on awarding delegates at the congressional district level but one could understand why obama s campaign might be interest in narrowing their candidate s national poll deficit with clinton especially at a time when more and more states are due to have their own contests _meta_end_dot_

 but still that s thin gruel upon which to claim that florida matters _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 there s no doubt that the primary system is broken _meta_end_dot_

 there s no doubt that the iowa and new hampshire monopoly needs to end and that an equitable system needs to be devised to give all states an equal chance of leading the pack _meta_end_dot_

 i even think it s bullshit that florida and michigan had their delegates stripped _meta_end_dot_

 but those two states knew exactly what would happen if they broke the dnc s rules _meta_end_dot_

 and as stupid as those rules might ve been they were the rules _meta_end_dot_

 so it s lame to now whine about the penalties they knew they d suffer if they didn t keep to the officially sanctioned calendar _meta_end_dot_

 it s obvious that hillary needed something anything _meta_end_exclamation_

 to change the storyline from the good ol fashioned whooping she got in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 but like the party of ideas bit the national ad buy in florida bit is simply and substantively a dishonest gambit on the part of the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_
