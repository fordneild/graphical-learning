  after a new york times editorial page editor defended the hiring of william kristol by making the laughable claim that he was a serious respected conservative intellectual i was inspired to put together a collection that would show how often and overwhelmingly wrong kristol has been _meta_end_dot_

 in part i of this series kristol s relentless drum beat for war in iraq was highlighted while part ii focused on his fearmongering claims about wmd and his later rationalizations when those weapons failed to materialize _meta_end_dot_

 and this week i will concentrate on kristol s demonization of those who opposed the war and his rosy assessments of progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 let s begin by looking at kristol s treatment of those who opposed his and the administration s neocon fantasy to shape a new century favorable to american principles and interests just two months before congress was to vote on the authorization to use military force against iraq and amidst a growing chorus of voices opposing the war kristol wrote so what were those crazy kids saying to make kristol laugh _meta_end_question_

 the new york times worried about the country s volatile mix of shiites and sunnis arabs and kurds while brent scowcroft argued that war in iraq and if you ignore the nearly five years of ethnic cleansing and sectarian violence the resurgence of the taliban in afghanistan osama bin laden s continuing freedom the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion spent so far the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 military deaths and the increase of terrorists worldwide those arguments were laughably weak _meta_end_dot_

 and so kristol got his war _meta_end_dot_

 and as the years passed and opposition to the war increased as the casualties mounted and the violence continued unabated kristol responded critics in the only way he could yes opposition to the war is simply bush hate _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t the hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars it s just an america hating desire to humiliate george bush _meta_end_dot_

 because after all the war has gone so well over and over year after year kristol was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but being wrong had never stopped kristol before so naturally he latched onto george bush s escalation as the latest path to victory _meta_end_dot_

 just another chance for kristol to say we are at a pivotal turning point and on the way to success _meta_end_dot_

 and to the critics who point out that the iraqi government has failed to meet the required benchmarks kristol says that is oh _meta_end_question_

 how was it that george bush explained his escalation of the war _meta_end_question_

 and what we have more than a year later is the administration occasionally saying a benchmark has been met before retracting the claim while iraqi officials believe they might be able to take over by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 success _meta_end_exclamation_

 or as kristol put it nearly five years ago despite the continued killings of american soldiers the situation on the ground in iraq may well be turning and as a matter of fact kristol is no longer hedging his bets with may well be because leaving aside the fact that kristol and his ilk cheerfully ignore that more than half of all americans want our troops out of iraq one can only look at his latest measure of success and say uh oh and according to william kristol we re winning _meta_end_question_
