  takeover the return of the imperial presidency and the subversion of american democracy little brown and company when historians look back at this era in america charlie savage s takeover should serve as a primary chronicle of how america went so wrong so fast _meta_end_dot_

 prior to penning this book savage was most widely known as the boston globe reporter who was awarded a pulitzer prize primarily for his tenacious coverage of the effects and implications of president bush s signing statements _meta_end_dot_

 in takeover the journalist takes full advantage of having a wider canvas and some intellectual stretching room to connect the dots of the insistent constant push the bush administration has launched against the two other branches of government _meta_end_dot_

 savage lays the groundwork by looking backward first giving an overview of the gradually expanding presidential powers or executive attempts to expand the power and demonstrates that this is not a partisan issue _meta_end_dot_

 as the new branch for conservatives became an uncompromising republican stronghold for the current administration cheney and bush began digging in their heels early on savage points out _meta_end_dot_

 even before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there were indications small and comparatively trivial compared with later sweeping war powers claimed that cheney s long cherished push to restore power to the presidency was going to be a fight this administration wanted to pick at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 one of the first fights was over the energy task force and cheney s reluctance to turn over notes or attendance records of the meetings _meta_end_dot_

 savage documents gao head david walker s fight over what inside sources labeled generally uninteresting papers the eagerness of the administration to engage in an expansion of presidential power precedent over minor issues savage speculates was due to the alliance of cheney and his henchman david addington _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect the author writes it seems likely that the embryo of the bush cheney administration s legal strategy began incubating at the moment cheney s career long drive for a policy of expansive presidential power encountered addington s theories this policy was pushed to a less publicized extent when bush announced that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 was withdrawing from the abm missile treaty _meta_end_dot_

 as savage notes by unilaterally scrapping the abm treaty bush seized for the presidency the power to pull the united states out of any treaty without obtaining the consent of congress yet little attention was paid at the time to the down the road implications of this action _meta_end_dot_

 it was not until the full flowering of the expansion of the presidential commander in chief powers after the terror attacks that the previous wrangling over executive privilege national security and secrets began to make sense _meta_end_dot_

 it is this portion of the book when the author lays out the complicated timeline advancing on several fronts that really shines _meta_end_dot_

 savage constructs a verbal timeline weaving back and forth between the immigrant sweeps and denial of rights in the immediate aftermath of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the setting up of gitmo and the tribunals to the unauthorized wiretapping and surveillance to torture _meta_end_dot_

 these are complex and simultaneous pressures that the president and vice president were exerting on several different fronts _meta_end_dot_

 this account by savage is probably the best i ve run across in making sense of the timing and strategy of the issues implied by the wedding of unitary executive theory and the vast inherent powers the administration was claiming for the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 the background of dick cheney john yoo addington jay bybee alberto gonzales are sketched in and their self reinforcing isolated bubbles of non mainstream legal opinion bounce off each other and amplify truly dangerous anti democratic thinking _meta_end_dot_

 as savage puts it this macho one upmanship extended as we now know to the imposition of political appointees on departments that had long traditions of non politicization and professional civil service employees _meta_end_dot_

 the unraveling of these agencies as doctrinaire bush appointees began to invade has been well publicized in recent months in the department of justice _meta_end_dot_

 other instances such as in the jag corps are only now making their way into public knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 these twin pressures of overreaching executive claims and the seeding of the federal government agencies with ideologues and right wing loyalists are going to present a challenge to the next president _meta_end_dot_

 the purifying of the professional civil service establishment is going to be difficult to achieve without cries of political retribution ringing far and wide even more improbable to imagine is a president willing to shuck the strengthened powers bush has seized for the office _meta_end_dot_

 savage s book is important in this regard becoming familiar with the details of how aberrant this administration has become is surely the first step in rectifying the unconstitutional overreach _meta_end_dot_

 it also serves as a superb introduction for citizens only vaguely aware of what s at stake in the executive privilege realm and what that means for the permanent loss of our liberties _meta_end_dot_

 as the author notes it s all about precedent and that s what we need to fight the most in light of takeover and its crucial examination readers should also note savage s story published in yesterday s boston globe in which the current crop of presidential candidates explains views of executive privilege and power _meta_end_dot_

 the future of american democracy may depend on getting this choice right after what the bush cheney administration has done to this country _meta_end_dot_
