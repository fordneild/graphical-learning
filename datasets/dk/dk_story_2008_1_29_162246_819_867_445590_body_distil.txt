  maybe they just wanted to make the senate see how if feels to have a piece of controversial legislation dumped on them right before the other body takes off just like last august with the last fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 but here s some fun news the house just passed by voice vote a _meta_number_ref_ day extension of the paa _meta_end_dot_

 update i left out the key part the house will soon go on recess for the rest of the week _meta_end_dot_

 so they are dropping this on the senate the senate can t force through the bad intel version of the bill in the next two days and then make the house pass it under the threat of the expiration of the law which happens feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ now the paa isn t necessarily a good thing to be extending but politically this was the best we could hope for in the short term from the house _meta_end_dot_

 this gives the senate something to focus on an extension of the existing law _meta_end_dot_

 it also potentially puts the republicans in a difficult position given the imminent expiration of the law _meta_end_dot_

 if they continue to obstruct allowing any amendments to the current base bill they will be responsible for letting the law expire _meta_end_dot_

 their president has been telling them that all hell will break loose and the terrorists will win if they let it expire _meta_end_dot_

 being the ones responsible would put them in a slightly uncomfortable position wouldn t it _meta_end_dot_

 house republicans might actually be in conflict with their senate colleagues since they actually helped push this extension and they seem convinced that bush would not veto this extension if they passed it _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if the senate is listening _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime while the paa is a crappy bill this extension would give us more time to keep the pressure going on rockefeller and crew to be actual democrats and fight for a fisa bill that actually protects the rights of americans _meta_end_dot_
