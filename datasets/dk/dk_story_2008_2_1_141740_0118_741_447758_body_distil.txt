  moveon isn t the only progressive endorsement obama has picked up since edwards left the race in a rare move the nation magazine devoted its cover to a piece supporting obama _meta_end_dot_

 christopher hayes article gives significant attention to concerns about obama but ultimately argues for him based on his movement building potential it seems there are a couple things going on here _meta_end_dot_

 one is a terrifically exciting primary that progressive institutions want to have a voice in and exercise whatever leverage they possess on _meta_end_dot_

 another i think is that exercising progressive leverage becomes particularly important with john edwards out of the race since through the past year he has pushed the debate leftward _meta_end_dot_

 his withdrawal allows others to step into a space already marked out for a progressive voice _meta_end_dot_

 or in the case of the california seiu to move their endorsement to obama and of course there is barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 there s the sense of promise around the movement he has built and could perhaps continue to build _meta_end_dot_

 this week it seems that prominent liberal forces from longstanding ones like the nation and members of the kennedy family to new ones like moveon are coalescing around that promise _meta_end_dot_
