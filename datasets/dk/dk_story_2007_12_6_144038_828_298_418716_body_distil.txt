  with the media hauling out the silver trumpets and pounding the drums all week to compare willard romney s speech with that of john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy it seems only right to do just that _meta_end_dot_

 npr has transcripts of both kennedy s _meta_number_ref_ speech made in houston before a gathering of protestant ministers and romney s speech made before supporters at the george bush presidential library _meta_end_dot_

 that the two speeches should be compared isn t just a matter of two candidates from a minority religion facing questions of faith _meta_end_dot_

 romney sold this speech from the beginning as his opportunity to try on kennedy s shoes and he doesn t hesitate to claim kennedy as his own _meta_end_dot_

 however from the beginning it s clear that the shoes don t fit _meta_end_dot_

 romney kennedy that difference is not a minor one _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s speech was full of bold direct confrontation of the issues facing him not as a catholic but as democratic candidate for president _meta_end_dot_

 romney s speech is beginning to end a distortion of history _meta_end_dot_

 not only does he attempt to strip the democrat from jfk he is ready to accept every lie about the relationship between religion and the history of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 his speech plays to the full set of fears republicans have used to bludgeon the public over the last twenty years and builds to a frighteningly explicit demand for theocracy _meta_end_dot_
