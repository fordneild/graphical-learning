 there is one bit of good news from the conference _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday a crucial victory was won by the least developed countries mostly african and small island states who have contributed least to global warming but stand to suffer most from its effects _meta_end_dot_

 they gained fair representation on the new body which will distribute money from the kyoto protocol adaptation fund operating under the united nations framework convention on climate change _meta_end_dot_

 money has been accumulating in the fund for several years but distribution has been held up because there was an ongoing dispute over who would be in charge _meta_end_dot_

 until tuesday the only choice had been the washington d c based global environment facility _meta_end_dot_

 most developing countries objected to this because they ve been trying futilely for years to obtain adequate adaptation money from the gef whose council is controlled by the united states which of course has refused to ratify the kyoto protocol _meta_end_dot_

 the outrageousness of the situation for these countries one of the key reasons for not wanting the gef in charge was starkly illustrated in an oxfam report released late last month _meta_end_dot_

 the report shows that the gef has so far only provided _meta_dollor_ref_ million to the least developed countries fund established by the unfccc to cover climate adaptation expenses by the world s _meta_number_ref_ poorest countries _meta_end_dot_

 as oxfam noted that s less than americans spend on suntan lotion in a month _meta_end_dot_

 as the organization s kate raworth said _meta_dollor_ref_ million is an insult to global justice oxfam estimates all developing countries together need _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year for climate change adaptation _meta_end_dot_
