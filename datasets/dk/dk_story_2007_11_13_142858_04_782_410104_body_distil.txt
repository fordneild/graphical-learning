  the words are pretty it s the action i m worried about _meta_end_dot_

 there s already talk about _meta_number_ref_ votes which remember is the threshold for passing anything democrats want unlike the _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold republicans enjoy _meta_end_dot_

 however bush and the republicans don t get their war for another year unless they compromise by adding the one year timeline _meta_end_dot_

 if reid and pelosi stand firm on this they will have a chance to finally fulfill one of their key _meta_number_ref_ campaign promises and prove that they have the strength and fortitude to stand tough for what they believe all the while giving the vast majority of the american people what they want _meta_end_dot_

 if not they will reinforce perceptions of democratic weakness and side with unpopular republicans on an unpopular war _meta_end_dot_

 funny that we even have to wonder which option they ll choose _meta_end_dot_
