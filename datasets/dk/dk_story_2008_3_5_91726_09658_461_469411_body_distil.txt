  last week when john w _meta_end_dot_

 mccain accepted an endorsement from john end times hagee mccain said but with questions being raised about anti catholic statements made by him hagee has been forced to issue a statement expressing shock and sadness that his words have been mischaracterized well there you have it he is most assuredly not anti catholic _meta_end_dot_

 we can forget that he called the catholic church the great whore and a false cult system that was said with love and respect _meta_end_dot_

 and when he said that there is a clear record of history linking adolf hitler and the roman catholic church in a conspiracy to exterminate the jews he didn t really mean that the church conspired with hitler to exterminate jewish people _meta_end_dot_

 of course he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we should call him the straight talking pastor _meta_end_dot_

 john hagee is a lover not a hater _meta_end_dot_

 and now that he s cleared up all of those misconceptions perhaps our intrepid press corps could get a clarification from senator straight talk because after questions were raised about hagee mccain said so please let s find out exactly which beliefs mccain doesn t endorse _meta_end_dot_

 is it hagee s past statements about catholics _meta_end_question_

 because if that s the case doesn t that mean that mccain is denouncing and rejecting the statement from hagee saying he has great respect for the catholic church _meta_end_question_

 and wouldn t that be calling the man whose endorsement mccain proudly accepted a liar _meta_end_question_

 or does mccain believe that saying the catholic church is the great whore who conspired with hitler can be explained away _meta_end_question_

 and when the press clears that up maybe they could ask mccain if he agrees that the victims of hurricane katrina were the recipients of the judgement of god for their sins _meta_end_dot_

 hagee was pretty adamant about that one _meta_end_dot_
