  we found out this morning that major league asshole chris lehane had been fired by seiu _meta_end_dot_

 i just got confirmation from change to win the coalition of seven top unions including seiu teamsters and the laborers has also kicked lehane to the curb _meta_end_dot_

 i was given this statement by a ctw spokesman nice _meta_end_dot_

 lehane may have a great future helping corporate america bust unions but as long as he never works in progressive politics it ll be a net win for our side _meta_end_dot_
