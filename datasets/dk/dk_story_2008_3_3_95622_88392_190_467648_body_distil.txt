  it s developed from speculation to obliquely sourced possibility to pretty likely that the house is going to cave and give bush his protect at t act _meta_end_dot_

 for no good reason at all _meta_end_dot_

 bully for you congressman reyes for being able to talk to the telcos about their illegal activities _meta_end_dot_

 how about the rest of us _meta_end_question_

 how about the american citizens who were spied on illegally and want to know why _meta_end_question_

 perhaps congressman reyes should consider calling those telco ceos into a public hearing so that we could all learn about their role in the spying program before sealing that deal before ensuring that those activities will never be examined by a court of law _meta_end_dot_

 and all due respect to the congressman his judgment on this matter shouldn t be substituted for that of a federal court _meta_end_dot_

 while we re talking about hearings that should happen before any further action is taken on telco amnesty or indeed any intelligence matter before the congress maybe reyes would want to spend some time looking into bush s friday massacre of the foreign intelligence advisory board now to be known as the intelligence advisory board _meta_end_dot_

 along with the foreign being excised so was any oversight capacity by that board of any intelligence activity _meta_end_dot_

 congressman reyes could start his investigation by comparing the statements of policy from the old board vs _meta_end_dot_

 bush s version what s missing _meta_end_question_

 that s right assure the legality of the activities of the intelligence community this administration is attempting to make all intelligence activities foreign and domestic by the government extra legal outside of the jurisdiction of the courts and completely under the purview of his office _meta_end_dot_

 telco amnesty is just one part of that effort _meta_end_dot_

 seems like something the congress s intelligence committees as well as judiciary would want to look into a bit _meta_end_dot_

 just because the executive no longer believes in the rule of law and is doing its damnedest to cut the judiciary out of any oversight of intelligence it doesn t mean the legislative branch should follow suit _meta_end_dot_
