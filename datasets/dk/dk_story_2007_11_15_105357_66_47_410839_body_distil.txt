 if _meta_number_ref_ election for u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate were held today for whom would you vote for if the choices were between scott kleeb the democrat and jon bruning the republican _meta_end_question_

 clearly we start this one in the hole assuming kleeb even runs _meta_end_dot_

 but as you ll see below in the crosstabs johanns and bruning are both very well known statewide in nebraska while _meta_number_ref_ percent have never heard of kleeb _meta_end_dot_

 and those who know kleeb love him scoring _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ favorable unfavorable ratings or better than a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ratio _meta_end_dot_

 the very popular mike johanns is just above _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally i also polled omaha mayor mike fahey and his numbers were little better than kleeb s _meta_end_dot_

 they both start at generic democrat levels against well known republicans _meta_end_dot_
