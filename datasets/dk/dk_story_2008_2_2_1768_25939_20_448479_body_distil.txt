  the fate of the living planet is the most important issue facing mankind wisconsin senator gaylord nelson the eco diary rescue appears every saturday afternoon or evening _meta_end_dot_

 if you have missed the most recent two you can find them here and here _meta_end_dot_

 i don t often give prominence to a particular diary in the rescue because there are so many good ones it s hard to choose _meta_end_dot_

 but this week i found davidseth s compelling _meta_end_dot_

 viewing the yet to be enacted federal government s version wanting he offered my small local stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 he owns some land in rural columbia county new york in the hudson valley next to massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 like the rest of the country the economic slowdown some experts with tenure aren t yet ready to call a recession has struck in columbia too _meta_end_dot_

 davidseth decided to put a bit of his land into the hands of somebody who could make good use of it on many counts as he said a small stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 obviously not everybody can do this _meta_end_dot_
