  new data and models on the vanishing northern cryosphere may be even worse than previously reported update see torta s diary i m also told by senior climate scientists that _meta_number_ref_ is on track to be the second warmest year on record behind _meta_number_ref_ only a cool december could drop it to third place _meta_end_dot_

 in addition expert sources confirm that there may be enough forcing in the pipeline already to handily take us up to and maybe past the eemian interglacial point about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_number_ref_ c warmer than today sea level _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ m higher no matter what we do and if current ghg emissions continue and grow the planetary temperature may soon exceed the pliocene warm up about _meta_number_ref_ million years ago _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ c warmer sea levels _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ m higher _meta_end_dot_

 the next looming benchmark is the mid cenozoic when antarctica last froze solid about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ c warmer _meta_end_dot_

 you don t even want to know how high sea levels were then _meta_end_dot_

 business as usual ipcc scenarios show that the latter may be likely unless meaningful curbs on the growth of ghg s are enacted in the next ten years _meta_end_dot_
