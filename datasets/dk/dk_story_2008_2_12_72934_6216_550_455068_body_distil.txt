  the wsj has a remarkably succinct and refreshingly honest summary of where we are at this morning _meta_end_dot_

 with all the nonsense being spouted by pundits let s not lose sight of that or just how weak a candidate mccain is turning out to be _meta_end_dot_

 the presumptive heir to george w bush s policies is getting spanked by unhappy conservatives and evangelicals who refuse to give up on mike i majored in miracles huckabee and hold their nose for mccain the way they re supposed to _meta_end_dot_

 la and ks and the fiasco in wa are major embarrassments for mccain who is having a week as bad as obama s is good and bush s near endorsement might help with the dead enders that still think bush is doing a good job but the fact is many of them are the ones voting for huckabee and thumbing their nose at mccain _meta_end_dot_

 republican unity ain t here yet _meta_end_dot_

 that will come _meta_end_dot_

 so will a close and hard fought general election change doesn t come easy _meta_end_dot_

 but for now the deep divisions and lack of enthusiasm on the gop side are in full view and the media s pet narrative anything that happens is bad for dems and good for republicans including a passionate contest between two excellent candidates that drives voting numbers up is in danger of being overtaken by reality _meta_end_dot_
