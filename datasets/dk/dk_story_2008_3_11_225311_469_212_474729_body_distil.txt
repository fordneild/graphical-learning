  _meta_number_ref_ percent reporting delegates i m adding percentages now since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is the magic number for obama to get a two delegate swing from clinton _meta_end_dot_

 oh and gravel has _meta_number_ref_ votes so far _meta_end_dot_

 edwards got _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 update given that most of the outstanding votes are from heavily obama hinds and warren counties he should break the _meta_number_ref_ percent mark by the end of the night _meta_end_dot_

 update and with _meta_percent_ref_ reporting obama hits the threshold _meta_end_dot_

 will he hold it _meta_end_question_
