 protesting this torch relay is also symbolism _meta_end_dot_

 no one should be advocating violence of any sort in connection to this event _meta_end_dot_

 but those folding their arms and ignoring china s atrocities in tibet and elsewhere with the pretense that the olympics should be above the yin and yang of politics need to drop the sense of high moral outrage _meta_end_dot_
