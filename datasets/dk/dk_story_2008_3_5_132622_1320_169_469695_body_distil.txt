  wired s ryan singel explains that does in fact make some sense as singel agrees _meta_end_dot_

 since you can t know where a particular email terminates until it s opened if that s how you d determine it at all you can t tell whether it s foreign to foreign until that point _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise there the administration needs to lie to sell their product _meta_end_dot_

 which of course is not so much national security as it is covering their own tracks _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth pointing out again _meta_end_dot_

 also worth pointing out is that wainstein took pains in his presentation which can be seen online at c span org under the program title american bar association discussion on the future surveillance laws to recount the numerous provisions for oversight contained in the senate fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 but again i have to ask what good all the supposed oversight provisions are supposed to do us given that the doj has already told the congress to fuck off in its quest just to see how the white house is using its own email _meta_end_dot_

 imagine trying to get them to answer questions about how they re using everyone else s _meta_end_dot_

 to vote for fisa revisions at this point or indeed on any new program or power for the bush administration is to agree in advance to abdicate all oversight _meta_end_dot_

 we may need these weapons in the fight against terrorism and we may not _meta_end_dot_

 but if we do it s george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s irresponsibility in using them that s costing america its protection _meta_end_dot_
