  from the washington post saturday we learned that that the house is once again working on a deal to fund the ongoing iraq war with no timelines deadlines or other oversight _meta_end_dot_

 the source for the story _meta_end_question_

 none other than the democratic house majority leader steny hoyer _meta_end_dot_

 the long and short of it is that hoyer is shepherding a bill that trades _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in desired domestic spending in exchange for continued funding of the war and that reid has indicated that the end deal will be acceptable to the senate as well _meta_end_dot_

 markos noted on saturday of the dealing democrats that is a good and blunt way of looking at it _meta_end_dot_

 far from demanding an exit strategy or even a token timetable for the now excruciatingly unpopular war the democrats have now devolved into using it as a bargaining chip for other projects _meta_end_dot_

 give the democrats a little cash give the republicans a little cash and everyone will have something to vote for _meta_end_dot_

 after all there is a long holiday break beckoning and getting home to the family on time is far more important than having to spend a few more days haggling over something as unpleasant as determining how many more americans should die in an ongoing neverending clusterfuck _meta_end_dot_

 if only the soldiers could schedule their own breaks as reliably _meta_end_dot_

 i t is crystal clear that the congressional democrats are divided and incapable at best and incompetent at worst _meta_end_dot_

 we have been through month after month of similar showdowns followed by similar collapses _meta_end_dot_

 this time it at least has a financial price attached if the democrats are willing to sell out on the one overriding issue that brought them back into power in the _meta_number_ref_ elections at least we know they are able to use it as bargaining chip for other issues _meta_end_dot_

 somehow that is the exact opposite of comforting _meta_end_dot_

 how do we work for them in the next election knowing that on the central issue the last election they are unapologetically uninterested _meta_end_question_

 nationwide democrats were thrust into power in an overwhelming tide due to voter anger over the course of the war and over the governance of the nation in general _meta_end_dot_

 what is there in _meta_number_ref_ to vote for _meta_end_question_

 what possible credibility do democrats have over republicans in ending the war after time after time after time of abandoning all responsibility for it _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 we can support them and vote for them and we can do what we can do where our goals align but more and more it seems the answer is better democrats not necessarily more democrats and that organizing and providing support for more and more primary challenges should be one of our long term goals _meta_end_dot_

 if we have to be an increasingly hostile thorn in their sides to force party leaders into leadership then maybe that is the better course of action _meta_end_dot_

 the presidency itself is vitally important to us in order to block the nastiest of conservative plots from happening but apparently the much heralded house and senate aren t worth a bucket of ebola laced monkey spit _meta_end_dot_

 in battle after battle the house and senate dems have made it crystal clear that they do not give a flying shit about their base _meta_end_dot_

 they wish we d just curl up and die _meta_end_dot_

 they re happy to have the free help spreading their points but that help does not reciprocate in any way _meta_end_dot_

 there s not a damn thing they ll do on our behalf or on behalf of the voters who made their regained power possible not one thing _meta_end_dot_

 they ll even sell out move on by name and all in fear of this mythical overwhelming conservative tide of voters who will wag their fingers sternly and supposedly dangerously at the slightest provocation _meta_end_dot_

 they spend a hell of a lot more time worrying about what the racists think about brown people and the religious extremists think about non extremists and the corporate lobbyists think about corporate needs than they ve ever once worried about any of us _meta_end_dot_

 their strategy is all about placating of all fucking things the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 that s who they re absolutely obsessed with making sure the republicans aren t mad at them that thirty percent of voters who would rather join militias and drift off into the countryside than vote against hardcore republicanism anyway _meta_end_dot_

 they really have learned nothing in their decade plus of being out of power _meta_end_dot_

 not a damn thing _meta_end_dot_

 they re still obsessed with strategic plodding inoffensive timidity as the answer to all possible situations and questions _meta_end_dot_

 we can only be glad that the civil rights battles are largely over for black americans because these people would sell out absolutely anyone and anything in order to continue their consultant honed strategy of taking absolutely no stand on anything the slightest bit difficult _meta_end_dot_

 it seems hard to come to any other conclusion but that a large part of the party people like rahm emanuel and steny hoyer foremost in that group wants to cripple and kill us every bit as much as the republicans do all for the lazy assed sake of avoiding hard fights on hard issues and being able to go back to the milquetoast visionless blandfest that the party is at this point rightfully famous for _meta_end_dot_

 and the majority of the rest are more interested in their goddamn strategists than their goddamn consciences _meta_end_dot_

 w hat can we possibly do in order to move america towards a more forward thinking path _meta_end_question_

 it is the same story as always the democrats do not care about their base because they know full well we ve got nowhere to go _meta_end_dot_

 but still they push too far i am hardly a leftist and am more to the point usually a painstaking pragmatist willing to accept small victories over no victories at all but they have at this point got even me thinking it s a waste of time to work with them _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the answer is to excise the worst surgically _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t mean individual conservative democrats or blue dogs but the sabotaging powerbrokers the people strategizing out these absurd passion plays of pre planned cowardice in the name of not pissing off the mythical center of the country that demands complicity in all republican agendas whether it be scapegoating immigrants or continuing to look for a magical iraqi pony that would finally make the entire bungled war worth it _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps our only option is to go after those individuals full force _meta_end_dot_

 markos stated goal a year or two ago was to destroy the dlc and their mushy corporate and conservative placating agenda but they largely destroyed their own relevancy themselves _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s time to revise that plan and find more specific targets the party leaders who insist time and time again on not leading _meta_end_dot_

 and yet we are handcuffed _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot do anything that will too badly screw the democratic chances for the presidency itself because we really do urgently need that _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court hinges on it as well as the simple opportunity to prevent the at this point entirely insane republican foreign policy fiascos that have so badly damaged america s leadership role in the world _meta_end_dot_

 w hat strikes me at the moment is just how devoid of true inspirational leaders the current party is _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got nobody at least not that is a household name _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_question_

 a longtime liberal and a fine speaker but hasn t been able to accomplish a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 byrd made some fine speeches a few years ago but between those speeches he s always been erratic at best _meta_end_dot_

 reid seems like he s so miserable in the majority that he wants to just crawl under a rock and i can t tell if pelosi is being screwed by her subordinates is screwing them both neither is being screwed by the conservative dems or is suffering from something entirely different that i can t even grasp but in her role as democratic leader she is about as inspirational as a bowl of room temperature soup _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton seems to studiously avoid even the shadow of a hint of a larger vision and edwards could not get the press to like him if he personally had sex with every one of them _meta_end_dot_

 obama is indeed a fine speaker but is at his best in well crafted speeches in service to no particularly concrete or substantive goals and those goals he does most passionately espouse like chastising fellow democrats for not more emphatically embracing religion are the stuff of uninspiring broderesque conventionality _meta_end_dot_

 we have faced the most incompetent corrupt scandal prone and indictment laden administration in recent history and yet we still must from all corners hear paeans to working together with the worst of the worst and compromising with the bigoted and bridging the gap between our moderate party and the one that has been purged of nearly all but the most single minded of extremists _meta_end_dot_

 even if elected it seems improbable that we could hope for more than moderate dem caretaker status in the presidency a partial rollback of bush era abuses but not a full rollback a healthcare plan cobbled together in some fashion as to make sure the insurance companies are well taken care of and only moderate screwing of unions instead of full bore screwing of unions _meta_end_dot_

 it will be a hell of a lot better than being shipped to abu ghraib in a duffle bag but it is not really something to get giddy over _meta_end_dot_

 the blogs are one of the few sources of fire in the entire party _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got no political generals like the republican party s rove delay hastert axis of brutal enforcement and lacerating strategic competence and we ve got no agenda setting ideologues like norquist dobson or the other increasingly far right activists that can and do play the republican party like a fiddle _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party has been remade in service to their most conservative most bigoted most aggressive and most extreme members we on the other hand have yet to figure out how to get the democratic party to give the time of day to the vast majority of their supporters even though their supporters hold the majority positions according to the polls on nearly every one of the most important issues _meta_end_dot_

 we ve only got the blogs and other not terribly powerful activists _meta_end_dot_

 that is the only source of unapologetic ideology of long term vision or of passion for a common good _meta_end_dot_

 we have no leaders except ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 i do not have an answer here _meta_end_dot_

 but once again the democratic leadership insists on trading away all responsibilities for the iraq war presumably because they would rather abandon that responsibility than be forced to make any of the most urgently required decisions _meta_end_dot_

 once again each battle is willingly lost upon even the slightest hint of republican obstruction _meta_end_dot_

 once again we have people like rahm emanuel urging the party into accepting far right frames on immigration rather than stand up for a democratic vision of what immigration should be and how immigrants should be treated _meta_end_dot_

 we have people like steny hoyer using the iraq war as bargaining chip for other agendas _meta_end_dot_

 we have harry reid signaling where the fight will end before the first round bell ever rings _meta_end_dot_

 we have our own presidential candidates praising the utterly invisible wisdom of people like colin powell _meta_end_dot_

 rather than making the case to the american people as to what the future should be we have strategists consultants and leaders looking at the polls and attempting to manuever themselves through a sea of republican manufactured arguments agendas hot button issues and supposed public offenses _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got a republican party that was thrown out on its collective ear for corruption and incompetence nationwide and yet still there are no democratic leaders willing to seize the reins of the future themselves and bring a democratic vision of the future to the public _meta_end_dot_

 we do not have a party at least not one with an agenda that can make it past even the smallest of republican planted obstructions _meta_end_dot_

 what we do about that at this point i have no idea _meta_end_dot_

 but i am not about to sit back and pretend at cheerleading for a party that considers me no more than an annoyance to getting back to business as usual and i am not about to pretend that the ongoing deaths of the iraq war will be come november only the fault of the republicans _meta_end_dot_
