  remember that treaty that the bush cheney administration was insisting wasn t really a treaty so that the congress wouldn t be allowed to vote on it even though it sought to commit our troops to combat in iraq indefinitely _meta_end_question_

 think progress has the latest excuse in a long series of administration backpedaling maneuvers unnamed officials have told the politico it was all just a wacky translation error _meta_end_dot_

 gee whiz _meta_end_exclamation_

 raise your hand if you believe for even a second that the bush cheney administration let the iraqi government write the original of this agreement and then hand it over in arabic _meta_end_dot_

 i thought so _meta_end_dot_

 and our watchdog media s reaction _meta_end_question_

 why gathering some quotes from both sides of course _meta_end_dot_

 as opposed to you know asking for a copy of this arabic text and letting an independent translator take a look _meta_end_dot_
