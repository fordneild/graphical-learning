  tempers and hyperbole are high these days in the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 if you read nothing but the blogs you d think the democratic party was on the verge of the civil war _meta_end_dot_

 so as someone who literally had to flip a coin at my caucus the level of partisanship and of vitriol has been a little baffling _meta_end_dot_

 and it s good to know that i m not the only one who s going to be fine with whichever nominee we get _meta_end_dot_

 these donors more clearly reflect what i ve experienced in talking to people including activists during the primary this is a hard decision for many people to make _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been to three caucuses so far in this process in nevada colorado and my own in washington _meta_end_dot_

 at every caucus there have been a handful of true believers leading the charge for their candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and then there are the huge numbers of people there just to participate and to take part in what s going to be an historic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 there is a great deal of excitement out there about being a part of a party that has already made history _meta_end_dot_

 they re not talking about superdelegates and mandates and the latest attack flyer _meta_end_dot_

 they re not full of vitriol about either candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the vitriol is saved for the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they talk about iraq they talk about health care _meta_end_dot_

 they know that they ll have to work for the democratic nominee period _meta_end_dot_

 there will obviously plenty of democrats who would be more enthusiastic in working and volunteering for and donating to one candidate over the other _meta_end_dot_

 but the majority of people i talked to democratic activists at the caucuses will be absolutely fine voting for either candidate _meta_end_dot_

 because they don t want to live through george bush s third term _meta_end_dot_
