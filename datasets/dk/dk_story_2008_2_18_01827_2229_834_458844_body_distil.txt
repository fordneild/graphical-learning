  what we think of as mass popular culture has roots going back hundreds of years but is probably best thought of as arising in the late _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_

 music hall mass circulation dailies sheet music and eventually recorded music comics silent films and then talkies radio television paperbacks videos and now the internet probably have had a greater influence on how we think about major social economic and political upheavals as much as newspapers scholarly works and official government reports _meta_end_dot_

 war definitely has shaped cultural creations _meta_end_dot_

 cultural critics and historians such as paul fussell stephen kern and modris eksteins have shown the deep influences world war i exerted on the development on modern art and culture _meta_end_dot_

 in the opposite direction works of art and popular culture also shape what we think and know about war _meta_end_dot_

 if one knows anything about trench warfare in world war i it s far more likely from having read or seen all quiet on the western front than from having read a work of history _meta_end_dot_

 there may not have been a greater work of historical scholarship in the _meta_number_ref_th century than raul hillberg s destruction of the european jews but steven spielberg s schindler s list has had much greater influence over what americans know about the holocaust _meta_end_dot_

 works about a war that influence popular beliefs aren t usually produced during the conflict _meta_end_dot_

 one reason is that most wars between states as opposed to insurgencies don t last very long _meta_end_dot_

 since the rise of mass popular culture the united states has only engaged in a few major wars longer than a year or so _meta_end_dot_

 our involvement in world war ii lasted a little under four years _meta_end_dot_

 the us fought in korea for three years _meta_end_dot_

 our involvement in southeast asia lasted _meta_number_ref_ years and the period of intense combat lasted over _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 it s now our only modern war that lasted longer than our war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 during world war ii most americans had a sense of what the war looked like because they saw newsreels at their local movie theaters _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood also enlisted in the war effort putting out hundreds of films about the war _meta_end_dot_

 a few films about combat such as they were expendable have held up and been lauded by fans and critics alike _meta_end_dot_

 some others classics examined themes relevant in wartime such as heroism and commitment casablanca or the difficulties of soldiers returning home the best years of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 much later films like patton and saving private ryan were hailed as classics _meta_end_dot_

 but many of the best films novels and plays set in world war ii came out in the fifties _meta_end_dot_

 such works as the caine mutiny mister roberts the naked and the dead stalag _meta_number_ref_ and from here to eternity were often written directed or acted by men who had experienced the war or had at least learned about the stresses dilemmas and moral ambiguities of the war it depicted _meta_end_dot_

 the korean war is often referred to as the forgotten war _meta_end_dot_

 there are only two major films that deal with the korean war _meta_end_dot_

 the manchurian candidate has become a major cultural touchstone more for it s portrayal of brainwashing than the war itself _meta_end_dot_

 and robert altman s m a s h is a dark film that advances a deeply cynical view of the war it s probably better thought of as a reflection of american disillusionment with the then current war in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 altman s film did inspire the first immensely popular television show set during a war _meta_end_dot_

 for many of us our knowledge of the korean war comes mostly from episodes of the tv show m a s h _meta_end_dot_

 vietnam was much longer but like korea the best and most popular cultural achievements occurred some years after the end of the war _meta_end_dot_

 apocalypse now and the deer hunter were part of the first wave of more allegorical films set in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 later films like platoon and hamburger hill with their gritty you are there feel to the combat scenes set the tone for revisiting world war ii in a more realistic manner as spielberg did with saving private ryan and the mini series he produced with tom hanks band of brothers _meta_end_dot_

 band of brothers besides being historically accurate in depicting an actual company of paratroopers of the _meta_number_ref_st airborne division is a superior cinematic achievement to saving private ryan which is little more than two stunning combat sequences sandwiched around decent acting but a hackneyed plot platoon and apocalypse now are our primary touchstones for the american experience in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 however many who ve read it consider tim o brien s novel the things they carried the supreme work of american culture about the experience of american soldiers in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 i can no longer think of vietnam without imagining the narrator years later walking barefoot in to the river where years earlier his friend had died _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the few books i ve read that made me cry _meta_end_dot_

 between vietnam and the current wars in afghanistan and iraq we hadn t had a long war _meta_end_dot_

 although there s great fiction and cinema about the us backed proxy wars in central america i can t think of any works of fiction and just one film set during one of the dirty little invasions or liberations of the reagan bush era _meta_end_dot_

 the one film however is brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 three kings was marketed as if it were a caper film a kelly s heroes set in iraqi desert _meta_end_dot_

 it s much much more however the acting is top notch the plot and cinematography are outstanding and the politics progressive clear eyed and prescient _meta_end_dot_

 if only more americans had seen it they would have understood why a few years later the iraqi shia failed to greet invading us soldiers and marines with cheers and flowers _meta_end_dot_

 since vietnam a lot of americans began to associate music with the vietnam era _meta_end_dot_

 certainly music is intertwined with the protest movement of the _meta_number_ref_ s and _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 and there were anti war songs _meta_end_dot_

 but most people would be hard pressed to name three songs that are set in or about vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 for whatever reason popular music in the us has not been a medium that looked to the experiences of soldiers or civilians in american wars for subject matter _meta_end_dot_

 there s music of the vietnam era but not really many songs about or set in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the subsequent wars in afghanistan and iraq have inspired a handful of films but none have been very popular or successful _meta_end_dot_

 novels about the war on terror or the american experience in iraq or afghanistan have not yet hit the bookstores with any great impact _meta_end_dot_

 television has responded to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the wars in the middle east with mixed success _meta_end_dot_

 the liberal fantasy of the west wing ran an embarrassingly bad episode right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that was like a john ashcroft paul wolfowitz fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 more successful have been numerous episodes of law and order and law and order svu which have dealt compellingly with terrorism torture the dangers inherent in the patriot act the traumatic aftermath of combat and other subjects ripped from the headlines it s popular music however that surprisingly has given us what i think is the first great american cultural achievement related to the american wars in afghanistan iraq and against global terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 for those who ve followed his career it shouldn t be surprising that steve earle has depicted the american wars in the middle east with such clarity insight and radical passion _meta_end_dot_

 earle grew up near san antonio but by _meta_number_ref_ already on his way to being a musician he ended up under the tutelage of singer songwriter townes van zant _meta_end_dot_

 after writing songs for others and eventually recording a couple of his own albums and picking up his first grammy nominations by the early _meta_number_ref_ s his drug addiction landed him in prison where he got clean _meta_end_dot_

 he has portrayed a recovering drug addict in the wire and he s appeared on law and order as a teacher in a juvenile detention center after getting out of prison he s put out an album just about every other year _meta_end_dot_

 earle has always been political _meta_end_dot_

 he s been active against the death penalty since his teen years and has long worked with the vietnam veterans of american to ban land mines _meta_end_dot_

 early in his career he was touted as a new bruce springsteen but he appears to be modeling himself as least politically more on woody guthrie _meta_end_dot_

 he recently moved to new york city and his most recent album washington square serenade includes the song city of immigrants which woody would probably have been proud to sing _meta_end_dot_

 earle can write a good musical polemic _meta_end_dot_

 but his gift is for telling stories _meta_end_dot_

 in one of those great details of a life he went to o _meta_end_dot_

 henry middle school in schertz texas his gift of empathy caught him a bunch of flak in _meta_number_ref_ when he released the album jerusalem which included the song john walker s blues earle wasn t glorifying or justifying terrorism or the cause of the taliban _meta_end_dot_

 he was simply trying to do what great art does show you a glimpse of the world from a new perspective a vision of the world as seen by someone very different from yourself _meta_end_dot_

 earle s gift for stories his blakean revolutionary vision and hostility to authority and convention his radical politics rooted in american tradition more eugene v _meta_end_dot_

 debs and wobbly than karl marx and his gift of empathy are all in evidence on his _meta_number_ref_ album the revolution starts now _meta_end_exclamation_

 the revolution starts now _meta_end_exclamation_

 is remarkable not only for the songs but for the timing _meta_end_dot_

 when most americans were just discovering the horrors of abu ghraib and starting to have quiet doubts about the debacle in iraq earle was finishing an album filled with songs critical of the war in iraq depicting the injustices and inequities at the heart of much of our foreign policy as they play out in individual lives and challenging complacency and acceptance of the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 not everything on the album is political or about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there are a couple of relationship songs _meta_end_dot_

 there s the ramones like f the cc there s his hilarious perversion of springsteen s rosalita done as a louche love song to our current secretary of state how much i d love to see condaleeza react to steve earle hitting on her _meta_end_dot_

 the heart of the album however are two sets of songs _meta_end_dot_

 the second through fifth songs are about war and warriors _meta_end_dot_

 home to houston is a raucous truck driving song about a guy who came to iraq for the money but with a bradley on his back door and an rpg whizzing by his window prays to the lord to just get him home alive _meta_end_dot_

 in rich man s war jimmy joins the army because the jobs have all gone to mexico _meta_end_dot_

 that s a story we aren t surprised to hear _meta_end_dot_

 but jimmy s story is just the american version of ali s the other side of the story we don t typically hear warrior is a poem recited in the idiom of the king james translation of the bible _meta_end_dot_

 and the gringo s tale is told by a former soldier who throws in with the cia does dirty work through latin america but when he starts to think critically and ask the wrong right questions becomes a marked man living out his life in the shadows _meta_end_dot_

 a four minute song does not convey the facts the sensory detail the human character or the emotional nuances of a novel or a great film _meta_end_dot_

 one cannot listen to the revolution starts now _meta_end_exclamation_

 and really know about the iraq or afghanistan wars the way you can get a sense of the stresses of combat by watching band of brothers or platoon _meta_end_dot_

 but steve earle s aims for his songs are both more modest and most ambitious than to convey the experience of the american wars in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 he tells discrete stories of individuals faced with shitty choices who get caught up in corrupted politics _meta_end_dot_

 but with the bookends of the album he gets to his real purpose a revolution in thought action and imagination _meta_end_dot_

 for earle as for other revolutionaries and romantics like william blake the revolution isn t something that s about social movements and the superstructure and the like _meta_end_dot_

 clearly he values social and political engagement as evidenced by his activism _meta_end_dot_

 but the key to everything the heart of revolution and the quintessential quality of american radicals back at least to thomas paine is to not compliantly accept authority but to ask questions in short to be the seeker because of songs like home to houston and rich man s war the revolution starts now _meta_end_exclamation_

 should be considered one of if not the first great work of american culture inspired by or more properly in critical opposition to the american war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 with the romantic challenge to question authority and to embrace the revolutionary fervor that we can nourish in our own questioning of the world it is not simply a great album a great musical achievement but a great work of american culture _meta_end_dot_
