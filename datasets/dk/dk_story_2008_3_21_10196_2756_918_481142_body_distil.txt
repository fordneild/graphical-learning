  i recently caught wind of the following did you catch that _meta_end_question_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve rothman of new jersey s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district just the other day endorsed rabbi dennis shulman who is taking on republican scott garrett in new jersey s _meta_number_ref_th cd _meta_end_dot_

 that is to say an incumbent dem endorsed a challenger running against a member of his own state s delegation _meta_end_dot_

 but what does dccc executive director brian wolff have to say about endorsements like that _meta_end_question_

 quick someone call up steve rothman _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s violating a long practiced custom _meta_end_exclamation_

 how dare he _meta_end_exclamation_

 does chris van hollen know about this breach _meta_end_question_

 seriously folks i think we know this custom is bullshit _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz herself recognized this back in _meta_number_ref_ when she unhesitatingly supported challenger ron klein against fellow floridian clay shaw scott garrett is a total recidivist crumb bum and the people of nj _meta_number_ref_ deserve better _meta_end_dot_

 rabbi shulman knows this and that s why he s running to replace him _meta_end_dot_

 and rep _meta_end_dot_

 rothman knows this too which is why he s backing rabbi shulman _meta_end_dot_

 surely the good folks in south florida deserve no less from debbie wasserman schultz _meta_end_dot_
