  while the wga strike has gotten a lot of attention it s not the only ongoing labor dispute writers had been involved in _meta_end_dot_

 newswriters at cbs have been working without a contract for nearly _meta_number_ref_ years but that ended yesterday with a deal additionally the contract includes a provision giving the writers _meta_number_ref_ days of warning and bargaining time before cbs consolidates operations _meta_end_dot_

 this is good news for these writers it s also another example of good use of strategic pressure _meta_end_dot_

 one key moment came when the leading democratic presidential candidates declined a debate on cbs due to the writers situation _meta_end_dot_

 the wga has been using similar pressure in the entertainment writers strike as well as a divide and conquer strategy in which it has made separate deals with david letterman s worldwide pants paula wagner and tom cruise s united artists and most recently with the weinstein co _meta_end_dot_

 the weinstein brothers post miramax venture _meta_end_dot_

 these agreements show it can be done that the wga is eager to make fair deals and that successful production companies can afford the terms _meta_end_dot_

 this puts some writers back to work and with them the other workers who get laid off when productions shut down and increases pressure on the amptp as the hold outs become more clear and the public can see that the wga is not the group unwilling to negotiate _meta_end_dot_
