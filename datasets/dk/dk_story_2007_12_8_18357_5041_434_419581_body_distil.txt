  jane hamsher at firedoglake i just want to emphasize a few things about why this is so bad and what scum it shows lehane to be _meta_end_dot_

 as united hollywood says the hire means two things from the point of view of the amptp if they re spending heavily on pr they have no intention of settling anytime soon and they re using lehane to give themselves credibility with democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but i m more concerned with lehane _meta_end_dot_

 jane quotes him on the _meta_number_ref_ sag strike talking about the importance of supporting working people and their unions he said that in explaining why he and partner mark fabiani who is also working for the amptp this time around had reduced their price for sag _meta_end_dot_

 apparently in five years time those principles have so eroded that not only are they not working for the union they re willing to sell themselves to the union busters _meta_end_dot_

 lehane is well known as a democratic consultant _meta_end_dot_

 democratic candidates and groups should take note of what exactly he is _meta_end_dot_

 those who hire him knowing that are taking on the baggage of his betrayal of what he once believed in and we still do _meta_end_dot_
