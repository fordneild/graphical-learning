  i love primary season _meta_end_dot_

 last month i kept finding myself singing it s the most wonderful time of the year while driving from mall to mall on christmas errands and i wasn t prompted so much by the impending holidays as by the wall to wall news from iowa percolating in through the car radio _meta_end_dot_

 once every four years america s generally distractible attention briefly alights on my horse race obsession and for a few months i don t feel quite as much like a trainspotter as i do when obsessing over off year gubernatorial races _meta_end_dot_

 i love primary season and i love it in spite of the haters _meta_end_dot_

 hating on the long campaign and the intraparty vitriol is chic nothing seems to elicit sympathetic nods from thoughtful citizens even those who generally like politics as a disdainful essay about the pettiness and superficiality of the process _meta_end_dot_

 but that s part of the game and if you step back and look at the campaign as a whole it s pretty inescapable _meta_end_dot_

 the simple fact is that only a slender minority of the electorate even the likely voters so omnipresent in our thoughts these days really have the time and inclination to discern the serious policy differences between the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 consequently most americans vote for the candidate that they like meaning that they vote for the candidate who was best able to use the pettiness and superficiality of the process to his or her advantage _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying that this is a good thing i m just saying that it s a big part of politics that it s not going anywhere and that we re wise to learn to live with it _meta_end_dot_

 and if you can learn to love it so much the better _meta_end_dot_

 i love primary season because i learned a long time ago to love politics as theater as sport _meta_end_dot_

 now let me make clear right away that i also love politics because of the tremendous effect that progressive government can have on the lives of working americans _meta_end_dot_

 i believe in the power of government to change our lives for the better and to create a nation where every citizen knows that if she works hard and plays by the rules she ll be able to rest easy at night knowing that she and her family have a roof over their heads food on the table and the ability to go to the doctor without going broke _meta_end_dot_

 i m a committed movement progressive not a cynic _meta_end_dot_

 but i do know how to enjoy the game within the game _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i had as much fun writing the republican cattle calls this past year as anything else i ve ever written for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 handicapping the republican primaries is pure spectator sport _meta_end_dot_

 none of the contestants have any serious redeeming qualities i really can t get worked up over which one of them is best on the merits as they re all awful _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a lot of fun trying to peel the onion of the republican psyche and predict which of a motley crew can secure the affections of his party _meta_end_dot_

 and even though i do care about the democrats and where they stand on various issues i can also appreciate the relative skill with which they run their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t make me cynical it keeps me sane _meta_end_dot_

 i love primary season more than most kossacks yet i hate the primary system _meta_end_dot_

 i love the theater _meta_end_dot_

 i love the chess match _meta_end_dot_

 i love road to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but i do believe that as a matter of party policy the idea of having a couple hundred thousand people who aren t even necessarily democrats in iowa and new hampshire and to a lesser extent nevada and south carolina select my party s nominee is completely insane not to mention undemocratic _meta_end_dot_

 i mean the notion that one of the vaunted independents of new hampshire one of the dipshits who can t decide between obama and mccain has more of a voting say in the leadership of my party than i do simply because i have the misfortune to live in colonial dc is beyond frustrating _meta_end_dot_

 it s unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 i give thousands of dollars every year both directly and though my union pac to democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i m a unionist part of the cornerstone of democratic electoral success _meta_end_dot_

 every fall i canvass is the cold rain and snow for whichever democrat happens to be running for whichever seat is up _meta_end_dot_

 i m a charter member of the netroots _meta_end_dot_

 but i have no voting say in who leads my party _meta_end_dot_

 and so while i love primary season i want to kill it _meta_end_dot_

 i want to kill it dead _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to rejigger things by rotating other more representative states to the front of the line although that d be preferable to the farce that we have today _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to tinker with the system and still wind up with a staggered process where largely disinterested voters in successive states winnow down the field until the nominee emerges by attrition _meta_end_dot_

 i want to blow the process up empower committed democrats and in so doing make the convention vital and relevant again _meta_end_dot_

 and while my plan doesn t have a chance in hell of going anywhere discussing it is a lot more fun than trying to decide whether michigan of new jersey should lead off the _meta_number_ref_ primaries _meta_end_dot_

 here then is the outline of a proposed nominating process that i d love even more than primary season _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got a lot more that i could write about this proposal but it s long enough as is _meta_end_dot_

 i can see a number of arguments against the delegate driven process but why should i poke holes in my own idea _meta_end_question_

 i m sure that kossacks will do a good enough job of that _meta_end_dot_
