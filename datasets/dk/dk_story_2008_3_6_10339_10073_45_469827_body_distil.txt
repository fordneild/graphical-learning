  yesterday s trek to the white house by john w _meta_end_dot_

 mccain to receive george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s blessing to carry out his third term is making headlines across the country _meta_end_dot_

 and this means that a moment of unintended comedy from yesterday s white house press briefing is getting lost in the shuffle _meta_end_dot_

 here is dana perino describing the private meeting between gwb and jwm share it _meta_end_question_

 mccain lived it _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps ms _meta_end_dot_

 perino forgot about the _meta_number_ref_ campaign against mccain in south carolina where bush style experience had him fathering an illegitimate black child possibly being gay and or a manchurian candidate with a drug addict for a wife _meta_end_dot_

 of course john mccain appears to have forgotten about that too _meta_end_dot_

 if he s not proudly accepting an endorsement from a bigot john w _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is kow towing to a man of whom he once said but that was then this is now _meta_end_dot_

 being a straight talker is hard work _meta_end_dot_
