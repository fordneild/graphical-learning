  obama now up by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and now msnbc has called mo for obama _meta_end_dot_

 yes several networks have already called the state for clinton but the difference between the candidates keeps getting smaller and the remaining precincts are in interesting areas _meta_end_dot_

 update by kos clinton may end up winning this race but regardless msnbc and politico f d up by calling it so quickly _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at the county level numbers the votes are there to possibly flip this to obama _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it doesn t likely matter much _meta_end_dot_

 they ll be essentially tied in vote and delegate but of course there s pr value in winning the state _meta_end_dot_
