  dear members of the press please stop repeating the administration s lies about domestic spying as fact _meta_end_dot_

 ap nyt ap that bold part that part of the reporting that doesn t have quotation marks around it and doesn t have any correcting remarks after it and doesn t have a bullshit flag preceding it is a lie _meta_end_dot_

 how is it a lie _meta_end_question_

 let us count the ways _meta_end_dot_

 everytime you repeat the lie that domestic spying began after the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th attacks a data miner in some basement at the nsa gets his wings _meta_end_dot_

 really though _meta_end_dot_

 you would think that whole wmd in iraq thing would have taught you guys a lesson about repeating administration lies as fact _meta_end_dot_

 try harder to stick to the truth next time not the spin _meta_end_dot_

 thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 hugs and kisses br georgia
