  a diary from yesterday that takes a look at the math and delegates with slight editing in the intro _meta_end_dot_

 susang the issue here is that the way this is discussed in the media narrative does not fully educate the audience how daunting the math is for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 chuck todd is clearly the best at articulating all of this and i am convinced he understands these numbers in detail _meta_end_dot_

 however even todd has not been terribly aggressive in stressing the difference between needing _meta_percent_ref_ or _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining delegates and the voting margins required to make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan alter used slate s delegate calculator to try and juke the numbers to get clinton closer _meta_end_dot_

 but he is missing the blowout principle where it s unclear how the numbers move very little until the s push past certain blowout thresholds _meta_end_dot_

 just for kicks here is howard fineman on the night of the potomac primary talking about how clinton has to be within _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates of someone he calls bark obama h t tpm _meta_end_dot_
