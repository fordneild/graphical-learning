  from the diaries kos measuring size of obama s relative coattails on congressional races this is a long diary to read so i will tell you upfront what my conclusion is after examining the recent surveyusa _meta_number_ref_ state polling yes barack obama may indeed have huge coattails for senate and congressional races in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 now to the long explanation the recent surveyusa polling indicated a relatively even match between obama and clinton re _meta_end_dot_

 who would have the most electoral votes when facing mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama s total came to _meta_number_ref_ ev while hillary s was _meta_number_ref_ ev a seemingly even match _meta_url_ref_ _meta_url_ref_
