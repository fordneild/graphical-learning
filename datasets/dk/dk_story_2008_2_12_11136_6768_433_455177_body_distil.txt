  in rejecting the feinstein exclusivity amendment to the fisa revision considered on the senate floor today an amendment that failed by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ ayes to _meta_number_ref_ noes thanks to another painless filibuster of precisely the type we were promised would not be tolerated on this bill the senate has voted to say that although they were passing a law governing surveillance it was ok if the president decided that he really didn t like the law very much and wished to make up his own instead _meta_end_dot_

 exclusivity the purpose of the amendment that failed meant simply this that the law they were passing was the law and it was the governing authority for how surveillance could be conducted in america _meta_end_dot_

 the senate just rejected it so that means that they re passing a law but if a president decides later on that he thinks there s really some other controlling authority besides the law that s ok _meta_end_dot_

 the original fisa of course had exactly such an exclusivity provision in it _meta_end_dot_

 that the new revision of the law will have had that provision explicitly rejected can mean only one thing that nobody will know the actual state of the law on surveillance because the law as written might not really be the law at all _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it could be something entirely different and maybe even something you ve never heard of or indeed will never be allowed to hear it because it s top secret _meta_end_dot_

 or hell you may not ever hear it because the president will make it up as he goes along _meta_end_dot_

 it won t matter what the reason is in fact _meta_end_dot_

 all that will matter is that the law supposedly governing surveillance says that there may or may not be some other authority that really controls _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 maybe not _meta_end_exclamation_

 tee hee _meta_end_exclamation_

 isn t law funny _meta_end_question_

 i don t know why these people come to work at all _meta_end_dot_
