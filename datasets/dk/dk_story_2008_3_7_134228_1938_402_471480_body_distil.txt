  i admire samantha power _meta_end_dot_

 her _meta_number_ref_ pulitizer prize winning a problem from hell america and the age of genocide is a hugely important book _meta_end_dot_

 she chronicled the history of the idea of genocide as a political and legal concept to explain the systematic massacres of armenians by the ottoman turks and later the jews and roma by the nazis _meta_end_dot_

 she then showed that despite the claims of never again genocide has continued to occur and the united states and other democracies have done little to prevent the horrific slaughters like the hutu slaughter of tutsi in rwanda and the ongoing slaughter in darfur _meta_end_dot_

 samantha power is a model of a public intellectual who acts on her beliefs and ideals and it was no surprise that she became a key foreign policy advisor to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 samantha power also however did a dumb thing _meta_end_dot_

 this week speaking to a reporter from the scotsman she said this about hillary clinton whether or not she got played by the scotsman she shouldn t have said what she said _meta_end_dot_

 so today to avoid making herself an unnecessary distraction and lightning rod she resigned from the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 calling one of our candidates a monster or comparing one of our candidates to ken starr or implying that one of our candidates is less suited to be president than john mccain is beyond the line anyone officially associated with one of the democratic campaigns should cross _meta_end_dot_
