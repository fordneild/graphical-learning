  in previous essays i have examined the current political climate compared it with past times of dramatic partisan changes in the country and suggested that the _meta_number_ref_ election could be a transforming election similar in nature even if not in the magnitude of the victory to the _meta_number_ref_ election which brought franklin roosevelt in to the white house and huge democratic majorities in both chambers of congress _meta_end_dot_

 for many their first reaction is to scoff _meta_end_dot_

 such a huge democratic win following the big wins in _meta_number_ref_ would certainly be against recent trends _meta_end_dot_

 since the death of fdr only once when a party posted a net gain of more than _meta_number_ref_ congressional seats did they not lose seats in the next election _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the watergate scandal helped propel the democrats to a net gain of _meta_number_ref_ seats _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ they gained an additional net of _meta_number_ref_ seat giving them _meta_number_ref_ seats the only time any party has had more seats in congress was from _meta_number_ref_ through _meta_number_ref_ when the democrats had over _meta_number_ref_ seats _meta_end_dot_

 however as i showed in my first essay in _meta_number_ref_ and going in to _meta_number_ref_ there are many exceptions to rules of election trends since _meta_number_ref_ which isn t odd considering the expectations derive from the results of just _meta_number_ref_ federal elections _meta_end_dot_

 if one looks at election to election variances as mostly the swings of a short pendulum it makes sense to expect a correction in _meta_number_ref_ or at least not a second straight big gain by democratic _meta_end_dot_

 but the underlying terrain for _meta_number_ref_ is far more favorable than one would expect under the conventional assumptions of election trends especially if the tottering economy and growing credit and housing problems continue to get worse _meta_end_dot_

 we are not dealing with a pendulum we re dealing with a strong and long term movement of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 in my second essay i showed plenty of evidence to suggest that almost all the partisan and campaign operational advantages currently favor the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats current advantages in registration trends campaign finances seats without incumbents running for reelection polling desire for change and candidate recruitment may but next fall be unprecedented at least in the era since the expansion of the federal government and the movement from rural to urban and suburban areas that occurred during the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 literally there is just about no good news for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 many readers of daily kos may think the democrats are not capitalizing on their current advantages to maximize the opportunity i believe we have in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is some merit to that argument although as i will show in a future essay it s likely that we will have big gains regardless of whether the democrats in congress and those running for president are bold or timid _meta_end_dot_

 there certainly is a precedent for such an occurrence the _meta_number_ref_nd congress _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with it s new and extremely narrow democratic majorities in both chambers accomplished very little pursed no bold strategies and provided few hints of the transforming political and policy revolution of the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 this unimaginative and low risk opposition to hoover by the way did not face the resolute obstructionism of the current republican party as several liberal republicans especially in the senate joined with the democrats in trying to set a new direction for the country in opposition to hoover s reluctance to engage the federal government as a positive agent for change _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the depression dominated american life in ways that none of our current issues do _meta_end_dot_

 the republican failure to deal with that catastrophe was the dominant nearly exclusive reason for the democrats huge victory in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately no single issue dominates our lives the way the depression did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the primary factor in the democrats current standing is the deep dissatisfaction with the presidency of george w bush _meta_end_dot_

 roughly two thirds of americans disapprove of his prosecution of the war in iraq and his failure to change course and pursue a responsible withdrawal of american troops _meta_end_dot_

 republican corruption and republican incompetence exposed in the national embarrassment that was the reaction to the katrina disaster on the gulf coast also contribute to the current political environment _meta_end_dot_

 there are also inherent cultural social political and ideological contradictions with the leadership and activist core of the republican party which threatens to open huge rifts within the party and it s electoral coalition _meta_end_dot_

 i will address this component of the political environment in coming weeks _meta_end_dot_

 even more than in _meta_number_ref_ however long term demographic and ideological trends have been favoring democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the combined vote totals for al gore and ralph nader were over _meta_percent_ref_ only the second time since _meta_number_ref_ that the loosely defined liberal alternatives exceed _meta_percent_ref_ of the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 it was the third straight election that the democrat won the popular vote and in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was as weak a newly elected president as we had seen in decades _meta_end_dot_

 one can persuasively argue that were it not for the distorting effect of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the ability of karl rove and company to exploit fear especially among key sub groups of independents and married and middle and working class women the election that kathryn harris and the supreme court stole from al gore would have been reversed in _meta_number_ref_ and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush would have repeated the pattern of previous presidents who had lost the popular vote and not been returned for a second term _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ john judis and ruy teixeira published the emerging democratic majority _meta_end_dot_

 some observers believed their book presaged a democratic victory in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it did not _meta_end_dot_

 however it did describe several long term trends that strongly favor democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ they revisited their thesis looking at the wave that that washed over republicans at every level
