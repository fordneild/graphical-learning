  one of the biggest crocks of shit from the clinton campaign and a dirty one at that has been the claim that latinos won t vote for blacks _meta_end_dot_

 it s quickly become cw _meta_end_dot_

 too bad it s not true _meta_end_dot_

 not only is the spin wrong but it s racially divisive _meta_end_dot_

 in a cycle where too many unmerited claims of racial insensitivity and sexism have been thrown around carelessly this is one that is genuinely disturbing and potentially damaging to our nation _meta_end_dot_

 it needs to stop _meta_end_dot_
