  not long after a new york times editorial page editor defended the hiring of william kristol saying that he was a serious respected conservative intellectual i began the tedious task of cataloguing how consistently and overwhelmingly wrong he has been over the years _meta_end_dot_

 describing his collective wisdom as _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote about kristol beating the drum for war with iraq in the months after september _meta_number_ref_th his hysterical claims about wmd and then his backpedaling when none were found and his demonizing of those who opposed the war as he waxed poetic over the latest corner turned _meta_end_dot_

 but the war in iraq isn t the only thing this serious respected conservative intellectual has been wrong about so today let s take a look at kristol running the gamut from hypocrisy to the laughable from dishonest self aggrandizing to outright lies _meta_end_dot_

 and let me add here that when mining the depth and breadth of the wrongness that is william kristol the problem isn t finding material it is culling it down to a readable length _meta_end_dot_

 so let s begin with just a couple of examples of his hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 here is what kristol had to say during the early days of the investigation into the outing of valerie wilson of course that call for respect of the rule of law went out the door once lewis scooter libby right hand man of dick cheney was convicted and sentenced to prison for purposefully lying to a grand jury and knowingly covering up the truth _meta_end_dot_

 then kristol argued that naturally kristol ignored that the underlying crime wasn t proven because libby obstructed justice when he lied through his teeth to the grand jury but gosh doesn t kristol sound serious by quoting shakespeare _meta_end_question_

 of course he probably could have found a better example than a man considering the potential drawbacks to committing murder but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 here s what kristol had to say about the senate refusing to convict bill clinton perhaps at some future date mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol will use some of his valuable new york times real estate to simply tell his readers why he now believes that perjury is no big deal the headline could read iokiyar but his hypocrisy isn t limited to just the big stories _meta_end_dot_

 consider these two lines separated by only two sentences in one of his columns really it s impossible to take this man seriously _meta_end_dot_

 so let s take a few moments to look at some unintended comedy from this intellectual giant no the republicans worship at the altar of that toe tapping larry wide stance craig of david diaper me vitter and mark call me foley _meta_end_dot_

 so if a nuanced view means stall sex with a stranger hooker sex with pampers and a potential star of to catch a predator then by all means bill let s remind the electorate of that _meta_end_dot_

 in fact bring it on _meta_end_dot_

 and this bold prediction from kristol speaks for itself honest to god big or small this man can t get anything right and not only wrong but dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ kristol was one of the collaborators on george bush s state of the union address _meta_end_dot_

 and during the post speech coverage on fox news kristol said with no mention that he helped write it _meta_end_dot_

 and later writing about it kristol gushed again not a word that he was involved in writing it _meta_end_dot_

 of course dishonestly is kristol s stock in trade _meta_end_dot_

 when he wasn t busy inventing imminent threats from iraq he was telling outright lies about stem cell research joining in the attacks against graeme frost or whining that the like s of karl rove scooter libby and tom delay were the victims of a liberal witch hunt aimed at the destruction of the conservative dream _meta_end_dot_

 or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 take all that toss in a little misogyny add it to his colorful history of warmongering and you have the sum total of william kristol _meta_end_dot_

 the serious respected conservative intellectual who once said perhaps mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol should ask the new york times that question _meta_end_dot_

 and then ask himself why he still has a job _meta_end_dot_
