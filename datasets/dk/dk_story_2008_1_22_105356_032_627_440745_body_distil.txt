  it s surprisingly tough to be a republican candidate in tx _meta_number_ref_ for the time being _meta_end_dot_

 with no fewer than _meta_number_ref_ declared candidates in the race to take on democratic u s _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 nick lampson and among those the district s former rep if you can really call shelley sekula gibbs that as well as pete olson a powerful lieutenant to sen _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn _meta_end_dot_

 in such a crowded field i suppose you have to pursue every possible edge in order to stick out so the republican former mayor of sugar land dean hrbacek has come up with a novel idea _meta_end_dot_

 he s sent out a flyer designed to make him look svelte and stylish by putting his own head on someone else s body now i know you re dying to see some photographic evidence so here is a photo of our friend hrbacek in real life he s the second from the right meanwhile here s the one he sent out in his flyer whoo lookin good dean _meta_end_exclamation_

 the campaign responded of course that the poor ex mayor is simply too busy campaigning to get a good shot taken riiiiiight _meta_end_dot_

 now hrbacek is one of the leading candidates to take the nomination after sekula gibbs and olson _meta_end_dot_

 it s fortunate that the republicans have such a divided primary it should significantly enhance lampson s chances of being reelected in this very red district _meta_end_dot_

 lampson was at least as of q_meta_number_ref_ filings kicking ass in the fundraising race with over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ raised and nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on hand _meta_end_dot_

 he is a conservative democrat but has consistently voted for timelines for withdrawal from iraq as well as for schip expansion _meta_end_dot_

 the crowded gop primary should drain a good bit of money from all the republicans not to mention that it should draw some blood from his eventual opponent _meta_end_dot_

 hrbacek and the rest of their republicans have their hands full just earning the right to face him _meta_end_dot_

 and getting busted on ridiculous and unnecessary nonsense like this surely can t help the man who would be congressman _meta_end_dot_
