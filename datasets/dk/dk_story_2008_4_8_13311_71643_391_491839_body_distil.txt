  at least that s what the wall street journal is saying _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the gop is unhappy with nominee woody jenkins despite his solid right wing credentials with endorsements from the club for growth and family research council and they re debating how strongly to back their special election nominee in an r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ district _meta_end_dot_

 wait their candidate has to meet certain financial benchmarks for them to even consider swooping in and saving him from defeat in a strongly republican district which hasn t elected a democrat since the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 it s surprising enough that this race is so competitive in the first place are they serious about abandoning jenkins if he doesn t kick his fundraising up a notch _meta_end_question_

 i suppose that s understandable in a way the nrcc hasn t been reaching its own financial benchmarks so it is hardly in a position to compensate for jenkins lousy fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 still i can t see how hoarding what little monies they have left would be worth the pr hit they would take for the future if they lost here _meta_end_dot_

 hell losing a district like this would seriously damage their fundraising ability going forward _meta_end_dot_

 nobody likes backing a sure loser and a loss here would indicate to one and all just how bad an investment it is to donate to the nrcc _meta_end_dot_

 james at swing state project has an interesting take on this like james i can t really believe that the nrcc is seriously considering abandoning this district altogether _meta_end_dot_

 but the mere fact that they re trying to lower expectations here is instructive _meta_end_dot_

 their polling hasn t been good and cazayoux s fundraising has far outstripped jenkins _meta_end_dot_

 that this race is competitive at all speaks to a number of factors cazayoux has run a good race jenkins has proven a controversial candidate ties to david duke will do that to you sometimes the general political environment is favorable for democrats and it s possible that an influx of katrina refugees to the baton rouge area has made the district slightly more democratic _meta_end_dot_

 while the republicans say that winning the race with jenkins is doable but difficult i still think it s tougher for us to win than it is for them even in the current favorable environment _meta_end_dot_

 that said it certainly seems like there s real cause for concern for them and reason enough for us to be very cautiously optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 strangely enough john boehner had a good line about republican woes here again from the journal article lipstick on a pig indeed _meta_end_dot_
