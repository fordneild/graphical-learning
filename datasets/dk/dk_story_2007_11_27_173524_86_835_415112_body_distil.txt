  i know that it s old news at this point and that there have already been a number of diaries on the story but i feel that it would be criminal for the front page of daily kos not to contain at least a brief condemnation of mitt romney s appallingly bigoted stupid and hypocritical statement that first it s just out and out bigotry for romney to say that he would apply a religious test when selecting cabinet appointees and that he would specifically apply that test against an oft maligned religious community _meta_end_dot_

 it s reprehensible it s transparently an attempt to score points with retrograde gop primary voters and romney should henceforth be shunned by anyone claiming to respect religious freedom _meta_end_dot_

 second it s incredibly stupid to allocate cabinet positions based on the percentage of americans sharing a candidate s religious preference _meta_end_dot_

 finally it s breathtakingly hypocritical for a member of a religious minority one who has spent a substantial amount of time attempting to overcome the religious bigotry of his own party to then seek to beat up on an even less popular religious group on the ostensible grounds that they constitue a small percentage of citizens _meta_end_dot_

 and it s just as hypocritical for an avowed opponent of quotas in affirmative action to support religious quotas at the highest levels of government _meta_end_dot_

 but then that s mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 the protean politician _meta_end_dot_

 a man who will say anything and attack anyone if he thinks it ll help him get elected _meta_end_dot_

 if he thought that the muslim vote would put him in the white house he d promise to name three muslim cabinet secretaries regardless of their qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 alas muslims are unpopular now in certain corners of your seedier political parties so you can count on mitt to bash away _meta_end_dot_
