  about all that nonsense bush is tossing around about this being a do nothing congress here s something to keep in mind with six vetoes to his credit during the first year of this congress and _meta_number_ref_ veto threats pending if this is a do nothing congress then we certainly have an allow nothing white house bush has stood the so called power of the purse on its head insisting he ll veto any appropriations bill that exceeds his budget numbers _meta_end_dot_

 he ll just veto them and send the congress back to the drawing board because the legislative branch didn t rubber stamp the executive branch s budget numbers _meta_end_dot_

 combine that with the move he pulled on fisa in august where he said he d force congress to stay in session until they passed the bill he wanted and he d veto all else and you have a pretty serious problem _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been waiting for the white house to threaten this on iraq and or appropriations as the end of the first session approaches _meta_end_dot_

 haven t seen it yet thankfully but we re not out of the woods yet _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote back in august there is something fundamentally wrong here _meta_end_dot_

 basically the situation is such that bush feels perfectly comfortable vetoing everything of substance the congress even proposes passing _meta_end_dot_

 forget the _meta_number_ref_ vote requirement in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 with bush if he wants his way it takes _meta_number_ref_ votes to do anything different _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ in the house _meta_end_dot_

 and the really wonderful news here is that any republican president in the future can count on the same dynamic and get pretty much whatever he wants this way _meta_end_dot_

 but no democrat can as long as democrats control the congress _meta_end_dot_

 because a democratic president can t run that hard against the democrats in congress _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t make political sense and it won t make sense to the public _meta_end_dot_

 but in divided government that narrative makes enough sense to fly _meta_end_dot_

 this is the institutional manifestation of the permanent republican majority if you thought it disappeared with the _meta_number_ref_ elections i wouldn t be so sure _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are willing to work the angles in ways that mean they don t even actually have to hold a majority to exercise it _meta_end_dot_

 if they do great for them _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t but they hold the white house they can pull out the veto card and force supermajorities for everything _meta_end_dot_

 it s built into the system and can only be defeated or rather put into stasis by perpetually electing democratic presidents and we re _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_number_ref_ on that score since nixon or by perpetually electing democratic supermajorities in congress _meta_end_dot_

 the only other situation likely to lead to a suspension of this dynamic of course is losing the majority in congress altogether and losing the white house _meta_end_dot_

 then they won t need it _meta_end_dot_

 again our record is not good here _meta_end_dot_

 the modern political era has been characterized by a virtual republican lock on the white house and a democratic lock on congress _meta_end_dot_

 so it only makes sense that republicans would want to make an all out assault on whatever powers the congress had vis a vis the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all known that this was dick cheney s primary objective all along but it s not just to avenge watergate _meta_end_dot_

 it also makes sense because it tilts the balance toward the one branch they always have a reliable shot at winning and means they can control the government by winning just one election whereas if we lose the big one our only shot at controlling government is winning _meta_number_ref_ elections _meta_end_dot_

 any less and it s a stalemate at best or else a series of capitulations that spell victory for the white house and it can last as long as any republican president wants _meta_end_dot_

 you d think that democrats might have a greater interest in aggressively defending the prerogatives of the legislative branch since that s where their power appears to lie over the long term _meta_end_dot_

 but strangely that hasn t been the case _meta_end_dot_

 instead the strategy has been to sacrifice the defense of those prerogatives in the pursuit of an all the eggs in one basket strategy of winning the white house and presumably never losing it again ever even though our record there has been spotty at best _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake we must win it lest another republican president use the office to lock down the judicial branch as well and give the sheen of legality to all of this putting a reversal perhaps hopelessly beyond reach _meta_end_dot_

 but some consideration really must be given to the long term effects of the dynamic the democratic strategy is creating _meta_end_dot_

 the fisa bill before the congress at the moment provides a convenient model for demonstrating this dynamic as well as the senatorial steak sauce dynamic discussed the other day _meta_end_dot_

 while we struggle mightily to sort through the procedural haze on the question of retroactive amnesty for the telecom companies who sold america privacy down the river the arcana of the procedure serves to give cover to this underlying problem _meta_end_dot_

 the house passed a relatively solid fisa reform bill in the form of the restore act and sent it on to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but rather than consider that bill the senate has considered its own as is their wont and now embroiled itself in the difficulties that referring that bill to both the intelligence and judiciary committees has created _meta_end_dot_

 and in the middle of those difficulties observers have noted that senate majority leader harry reid had under the rules at least several options open to him including having the senate consider the house bill directly _meta_end_dot_

 it s a relatively rare thing but not unheard of _meta_end_dot_

 he opted not to do so _meta_end_dot_

 in fact though picking up the house bill is hardly unknown _meta_end_dot_

 not to long ago in fact we were assured that this was brilliant strategy and it was even given a catchy nickname ping ponging why not _meta_end_question_

 because the house bill would be vetoed and bush would just pull the same trick he pulled in august send me the bill i want or i ll veto what you send and force you to stay in session to deal with this emergency and that will end in capitulation anyway so why not just save everyone the time and capitulate now _meta_end_question_

 a principled refusal to capitulate though forces the congress to face an excruciating possibility that the president is abusing his powers under the constitution to dictate the terms of legislation to the congress and that that s created a serious imbalance in the separation of powers and revealed the underlying truth that a congress unwilling or just unable to impeach a president that abuses his powers and usurps theirs is completely neutered _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if they opt not to have this fight or the fight over subpoenas and contempt of congress or signing statements or any of several others that boil down to this same problem in all likelihood no one of any importance or influence will ever figure exactly how neutered they ve become _meta_end_dot_

 people may call them spineless and weak but they won t necessarily notice that they ve surrendered the legislative prerogative _meta_end_dot_

 that s too much of an abstraction and even if it wasn t it d be too frightening a prospect for most people to contemplate so they just won t do it _meta_end_dot_

 now there s an argument to be made that fisa just isn t the ground on which to make this stand and that there s some better clearer turf _meta_end_dot_

 and there probably is _meta_end_dot_

 but if we re not going to have that fight either then the extent to which this gets offered as an excuse it ll be worth keeping in mind that there s no game plan or strategy for having the fight on any other turf either so it s ultimately a bullshit excuse _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside though civics classes will be easier to teach in the future _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tough spot to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 and the answer most often offered impeachment has considerable practical problems as desirable and well suited to the occasion as it is in theory _meta_end_dot_

 but in the long run it may be no more practical realistic or pragmatic to continue on as if the problem didn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 someone s got to take stock of this and start thinking publicly about how to dig out of this hole _meta_end_dot_

 so go ahead everybody _meta_end_dot_

 get to it _meta_end_dot_

 type me up some answers _meta_end_exclamation_
