  i just cancelled a few accounts on various social networking services _meta_end_dot_

 for one i never used them _meta_end_dot_

 for another the intrusive and possibly illegal nature of facebook s beacon service as well as the difficulty of opting out of it had me alarmed at how far the next venture by the next site might go _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted out once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 so here s how the cancellation process went for each friendster easy to find instructions on how to cancel _meta_end_dot_

 extremely easy to cancel _meta_end_dot_

 just fill out one web form and you re done _meta_end_dot_

 myspace easy to find instructions on how to cancel _meta_end_dot_

 click through a few confirmation pages get a confirmation e mail click a link there confirm once more on the web and you re done _meta_end_dot_

 very easy _meta_end_dot_

 facebook ah facebook _meta_end_dot_

 the real champion _meta_end_dot_

 impossible to find instructions on how to cancel _meta_end_dot_

 searching the help system for cancel account or delete account only shows instructions for deactivating your account _meta_end_dot_

 deactivation is not deletion it merely puts your account in limbo and allows you to restore it at a later date _meta_end_dot_

 so if you are concerned about say the security of facebook s servers deactivation does nothing for you _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately if you google around you will find that you have to e mail facebook directly to request deletion of your account _meta_end_dot_

 when you do they will respond by telling you that you must remove all content from your page in order for them to delete you _meta_end_dot_

 i think this includes just about everything friends groups messages etc _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding comes from this blog post this could be an arduous process if you have a lot of account data _meta_end_dot_

 however i also believe this to be a completely phony roadblock _meta_end_dot_

 i simply responded to the e mail by saying i had no profile content i didn t have much on there but i did have a few friends _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t however touch a thing _meta_end_dot_

 i received a response saying that my account was deleted _meta_end_dot_

 so it seems pretty clear that this whole content deletion business is b s _meta_end_dot_

 elapsed time three days _meta_end_dot_

 nb i sent in my request on a friday it took just minutes to delete my account on the other two services _meta_end_dot_

 as i say above facebook s beacon service was the key reason for wanting to delete my social networking accounts _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that this issue has even got moveon up in arms tells you it s for real _meta_end_dot_

 so i suppose it should come as no surprise that the worst offender both hides information on how to delete your account and makes you jump through numerous hoops some possibly bogus to actually delete it _meta_end_dot_

 i m aware that facebook now claims to offer a universal opt out but the company s constantly shifting stories and beacon ui have not filled me with confidence a word to the wise a few years ago aol was investigated by the ny attorney general for making life incredibly difficult for customers who wanted to cancel their accounts _meta_end_dot_

 aol was forced to clean up its act and pay a seven figure fine _meta_end_dot_

 facebook is already on the new ag s radar so they d be smart to change their ways sooner rather than later _meta_end_dot_

 anyhow i m sure my fellow kossacks have stories to share about their travails in cancelling online accounts whether on any of the above sites or on others _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve wrestled a particularly thorny account to the ground and have any tips to share please do so _meta_end_dot_
