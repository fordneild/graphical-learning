  let s be clear when a _meta_number_ref_ forms for the express purpose of electing or defeating a particular federal candidate and engages in public advocacy towards such ends as opposed to discussing issues it is breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 the media fund swift boaters and other _meta_number_ref_s have paid six figure fines for acting like a political action committee i e engaging in express advocacy and soliciting its donors with the major purpose of helping identifiable federal candidates but without abiding by any of the individual contribution limits or disclosure requirements attaching to pacs _meta_end_dot_

 but when you ve lost _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ contests _meta_end_dot_

 abc news has more i want to highlight that last quote to make clear the lengths to which this _meta_number_ref_ will have to go to even arguably have a case that it s discussing issues and not candidates _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they ve found a magic loophole but in all likelihood they haven t though their first ad follows all the rules in terms of don t mention the election _meta_end_exclamation_

 just tell people to make phone calls why _meta_end_question_

 because based on those fec precedents a group that forms on the eve of primary elections advertises only in the immediate primary election states and has no track record whatsoever of any kind of issue advocacy outside such context _meta_end_dot_

 well it s damn hard in those circumstances to claim you re not in it for the purpose of influencing the elections _meta_end_dot_

 the only piece of the puzzle we don t have yet is what s being told to potential supporters but since the website listed in that ad produces a dead link we have no idea the _meta_number_ref_ s leadership might be counting on two things first without a functioning federal election commission any complaint filed against this _meta_number_ref_ remains a nullity and second any subsequent fine might just be seen as a necessary tax on their efforts the cost of doing business to get clinton elected _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago the wsj quoted two of these clinton bundlers having major campaign bundlers involved in gutting the individual contribution limits cannot be the answer _meta_end_dot_

 in december both barack obama and john edwards demanded that _meta_number_ref_s purporting to support them cease their activities and denounced their efforts will clinton do the same _meta_end_question_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_p est we have our first clinton reaction according to fec reports vote hope spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on pro obama independent advertising expenditures _meta_end_dot_
