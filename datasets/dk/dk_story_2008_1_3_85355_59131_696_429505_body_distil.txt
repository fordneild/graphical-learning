  four years ago when i was just cutting my teeth as a front pager on a mildly successful political website or blog called daily kos i wrote a post on the morning of the _meta_number_ref_ iowa caucus called the end of the beginning i liked that class of candidates a lot and i thought it important on the cusp of actual voting to pay tribute to the manner in which each of them other than lieberman contributed to the campaign and helped advance the cause of progressivism _meta_end_dot_

 but i really like this class of candidates _meta_end_dot_

 it amazes me when i see folks obsessing on their downsides or hating on the entire campaign _meta_end_dot_

 when i look at the democratic field i see three americans who could rise to become great presidents not just good nominees _meta_end_dot_

 i see in john edwards a genuine tribune of working america one who cast aside his _meta_number_ref_ packaged southern dem campaign and who has fearlessly spoken truth to power while running the most authentically pro worker campaign in a generation _meta_end_dot_

 i see in hillary clinton perhaps the smartest politician of my lifetime but one with the political savvy to match her intellect and with a steely will that makes it difficult to imagine her ever really losing the nomination the presidency or the advancement of her agenda once in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 i see in barack obama a transformative figure who can truly move people across every spectrum ideological geographical demographic in a manner seen just once or twice in a lifetime and who is deeply committed to a more humane and just america _meta_end_dot_

 and i see one more candidate who won t be president but who has shown the fortitude and the chutzpah to lead the fight for the next president s agenda in the halls of the senate _meta_end_dot_

 because throughout this presidential campaign with his leadership on so many issues chris dodd has shown us that he might just be the right choice to take the torch from harry reid in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 it s been an extraordinary campaign with extraordinary candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and tonight is the end of the beginning _meta_end_dot_
