  on friday obama met with the editorial boards and reporters at both the chicago sun times and chicago tribune promising to answer any and all questions about the tony rezko matter _meta_end_dot_

 he did and gave a more extensive accounting of the relationship than before _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign tried to curry some political gain from obama s transparency there hasn t been a definitive response from the liberal sun times editorial board but the conservative tribune s board has arrived at its conclusion the chicago tribune has never endorsed a democrat for president in its history _meta_end_dot_

 its editorial board had every partisan reason to try and further damage obama on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 instead it has essentially exonerated him _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t be surprised to see the sun times follow suit in the next couple of days but that would be expected _meta_end_dot_

 the chicago tribune doing so is startling _meta_end_dot_

 and for those keeping score of the clinton and obama campaign s shadiest donors the tribune s blog has a scorecard ultimately there s nothing here because no one proved that clinton did any reciprocal favors for hsu and no one has proved or even suggested really that obama did any reciprocal favors for rezko _meta_end_dot_

 they both had unsavory characters raise money for them _meta_end_dot_

 big f n deal _meta_end_dot_

 you don t raise millions for political campaigns without coming into inadvertent contact with this species of human _meta_end_dot_

 so like whitewater this is a nothing story a minor scandal that political enemies are trying desperately to spin into something bigger _meta_end_dot_

 you d think the clinton campaign and its supporters would be a little more careful about this sort of thing especially after hsu but they ve got little else to work with _meta_end_dot_

 so there s this and wright and that s pretty much all that s apparently left in clinton s quiver _meta_end_dot_

 the short term gain appears measurable rasmussen had obama up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on friday down net seven points on saturday _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but on sunday obama was starting to inch back up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and we ll know in the next few days if there s continued measurable impact or just a brief statistical blip _meta_end_dot_

 these two scandals will likely end up being two of the three big pillars of the gop attack on obama this fall the other being experience _meta_end_dot_

 wright will be used to remind voters that obama is black and hates america like the muslims who share his middle name while rezko will be used to paint obama as a typical politician _meta_end_dot_

 the other line of attack will be the experience stuff _meta_end_dot_

 obama s handling of this stuff serves several key purposes it s warmup for the general election it allows him to deal with this stuff early enough in the process that it ll be long forgotten to all but the hardest core partisans in just a few short months and also proves to the super delegates that he s got the chops to deal with these sorts of attacks not just the bullshit swiftboat ones but the ones that have some merit as well _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in iowa saturday clinton lost a delegate while obama picked up nine of them in the state s county conventions _meta_end_dot_

 in oregon the state afscme broke with the national organization which endorsed clinton and endorsed obama for its primary _meta_end_dot_

 the party s activists continue to move in large numbers toward obama while nancy pelosi has essentially cast her lot with obama _meta_end_dot_

 clinton supporters are increasingly paranoid as the walls close in on their candidate s campaign but it s essentially over _meta_end_dot_

 they may rail against pelosi or the media or howard dean or keith olbermann or daily kos or whatever and whoever _meta_end_dot_

 but what they are seeing is a consolidation of the party around the primary s winner and that is already barack obama whether the clinton campaign and her shrinking number of supporters wants to acknowledge it or not _meta_end_dot_
