  not looking good thus far _meta_end_dot_

 update given this is a open seat in a solidly red district the district seems to be performing as it should except that at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ reporting a six percent improvement over democratic performance in _meta_number_ref_ not to mention that republicans dumped money they didn t have to pull this one out of the fire at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we ll know more in a couple of days _meta_end_dot_

 they won t have that luxury in many districts in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update ii okay i m done here _meta_end_dot_

 my kids are begging for a little attention before they go down for the night _meta_end_dot_

 republicans beat us in the expectations game got enough of their people out and basically kept things even from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they spent a shitload of money for an expectations game victory in what might have otherwise been a routine and uneventful hold _meta_end_dot_

 so well played to them _meta_end_dot_

 but the bottom line is that they held an r _meta_number_ref_ seat _meta_end_dot_

 funny that this is the sort of thing they re left celebrating these days _meta_end_dot_
