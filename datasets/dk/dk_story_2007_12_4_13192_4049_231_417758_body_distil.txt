  the terrain for the us senate race to replace hagel remains uncertain _meta_end_dot_

 ben nelson has been urging his republican friend tony raimondo to switch parties and run as a dem _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile scott kleeb is still considering the run _meta_end_dot_

 kleeb has a lot to think about but some time to decide at least until the end of this week when raimondo has to make a decision about switching parties _meta_end_dot_

 both of nebraska s party chairs are currently trying to claim raimondo raimondo himself says he s a moderate which is somewhat hard to believe given he was considered for an appointment by the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 he s given no further clue about his intentions _meta_end_dot_

 should he decide to run as a dem given the support he has from nelson and apparently from the state party chair he could be a formidable primary opponent _meta_end_dot_

 so kleeb has to consider carefully the potential future costs of crossing nelson and the state party _meta_end_dot_

 he is still considering his options and he released a video today to thank supporters in the draft kleeb effort _meta_end_dot_
