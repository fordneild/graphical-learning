  first big thanks to hekebolos and vernonlee for liveblogging this event _meta_end_dot_

 both did a terrific job of summarizing the words and tones of the candidate s statements _meta_end_dot_

 my _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ summary would be dennis kucinich is obviously enthusiastic about this topic and his personal efforts are admirable _meta_end_dot_

 however when pressed on specifics he wandered off topic and rarely gave any details of how he would implement his broad ideas _meta_end_dot_

 a good performance but i doubt it will pull in anyone who wasn t already a fan _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton as she has in many debates comes off as polished self possessed and competent _meta_end_dot_

 that may make her seem a little stiff and cold to some people but after eight years of bush competent seems hugely attractive _meta_end_dot_

 her plan seems solid and her calls for us leadership in this area were very welcome _meta_end_dot_

 however she often seemed more interested in inserting al gore or barbara boxer s name into an answer each of which drew expected applause than delivering a concise response _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards hit the ground running almost literally _meta_end_dot_

 he tore into the subject at a pace that made me breathless just listening to him and he was more willing than the other candidates to make definitive statements _meta_end_dot_

 he hearkened back to kennedy and made a call to national sacrifice but he didn t spend all his time stomping the big emotional notes and was ready with more information when it came to costs funding etc _meta_end_dot_

 edwards also seemed the best informed on the latest un report _meta_end_dot_

 overall i don t think that clinton hurt herself but john edwards may have helped himself _meta_end_dot_

 however the big winner tonight was the forum which conducted itself in a way that was miles ahead of the professional debates _meta_end_dot_

 each candidate had time to talk and all the questions were interesting without being trite _meta_end_dot_

 my hat s off to all involved _meta_end_dot_

 and remember when you get tired of talking about what the candidates said tonight have your own say in this discussion of the next version of energize america _meta_end_dot_
