  turn maine blue is collecting reports from the early caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 and unlike yesterday s caucuses this one appears to be based just on these reports to be a more evenly matched dogfight though it appears again based on just these reports that obama has the edge _meta_end_dot_

 update ain t technology grand _meta_end_question_

 check out google map mashup with caucus results _meta_end_dot_

 it s based on user generated reports so expect a great deal of reporting bias and probably in obama s favor _meta_end_dot_
