  last august i read a column which i thought provided fascinating insights in to the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 subsequent events have shown the column to be prescient this source i admit is problematic as the column was written by dick morris _meta_end_dot_

 morris has a long complicated and at times even sordid history with the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it was morris who brought mark penn in to the clinton orbit for the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 morris got tossed overboard after his toe sucking escapade while penn has become clinton s chief strategist morris has reason to resent penn and he s irrationally obsessed with the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 morris is undoubtedly biased against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 but in suggesting that there s nobody who can deliver bad news to hillary or bill clinton he also appears to be correct _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago i declared that the race for the democratic nomination was over barack obama will be our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom is catching up _meta_end_dot_

 more and more people are realizing that clinton is hanging around on the dying hope that obama will destruct either by his own hand or the hands of others _meta_end_dot_

 the early indications are that obama will weather the wright scandal ette and may in fact come out from it stronger _meta_end_dot_

 clinton ended up in this situation because she ran against an extraordinary candidate who s run a masterful campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but she has also hurt herself _meta_end_dot_

 she has never had a compelling message _meta_end_dot_

 she ran a safe campaign about experience in an election in which voters are starving for change _meta_end_dot_

 she couldn t reel in her husband _meta_end_dot_

 the crushing defeat in south carolina gave obama big momentum heading in to super tuesday it s unlikely obama would have won by almost _meta_number_ref_ points if bill clinton hadn t recklessly insulted obama likely pushing even more support to obama and possibly john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 she eventually fired her campaign manager long time staffer patti solis doyle but penn stayed put penn and harold ickes continued to battle and her campaign continued to fall behind obama _meta_end_dot_

 while he may be an asshat the evidence suggests that dick morris was right that hillary clinton s campaign was crippled by a dearth of trusted aides who could tell the candidate and maybe more importantly her husband when they were making mistakes when they needed to change course and who should be listened to and who should be ignored _meta_end_dot_

 now the question is if hillary and bill clinton didn t have anyone around would could tell them when they were wrong who will tell them the campaign is over and it s time to step aside and acknowledge barack obama will be our nominee _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to tell what s going on inside the clinton campaign but one has to wonder whether many of the top clinton supporters really believe in her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 surely some of the people who were top staffers to bill clinton know but few of them probably have the ability to tell the clinton s they will not achieve their dreamed of dynasty _meta_end_dot_

 they re estranged from many of their long time friends and close associates from arkansas it s probably too harsh but there s at least a little bit of truth in this comment comparing them to the great gatsby s tom and daisy buchanan few people have remained close to the clintons through all their difficulties and can still tell the what they don t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 but soon someone will need to tell them it s time to step aside _meta_end_dot_

 vernon jordan could be that person _meta_end_dot_

 vernon jordan is one of those creatures known in washington as a fixer he was for a long time the head of the urban league and then became a fixture on the dc circuit of lawyering lobbying sitting on corporate boards serving on panels and commissions _meta_end_dot_

 he chaired bill s transition in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and despite getting deeply embroiled in the lewinsky scandal he remained close to the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 at the lowest point of the scandal in august _meta_number_ref_ bill and hillary vacationed on martha s vineyard and about the only time they socialized was to celebrate bill s birthday with jordan and his wife _meta_end_dot_

 the relationship continues both jordan and his wife have bundled over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for hillary s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 jordan is committed to the clintons but he probably understands the extraordinary talents and achievements of obama _meta_end_dot_

 in october _meta_number_ref_ five months before obama won his senate primary he held his first dc fundraiser where he was introduced to some of the power elite in washington at the home of vernon jordan _meta_end_dot_

 someone needs to tell the clintons they will not have a dynasty _meta_end_dot_

 it has to be someone they trust and who can tell them what they don t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 and it has to be someone who can see clearly what many of us have known was coming for some time and what the traditional media are finally starting to recognize that barack obama will be our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 jordan it s getting to that time where you re going to have to break bill and hillary the news _meta_end_dot_
