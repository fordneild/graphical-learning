  britain has announced that iraqi security forces will officially take over security in basra on sunday _meta_end_dot_

 by spring the uk plans to have no more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops left in this critical province which dominates the american coalition s southern supply route _meta_end_dot_

 by august not long after gordon brown had replaced tony blair it was clear the british high command and brown s government were determined to end the british occupation as quickly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 the british moved ahead with the plan despite bitter resentment in washington _meta_end_dot_

 bush and the pentagon let it be known that this would constitute not an orderly withdrawal but rather a defeat of the british in basra _meta_end_dot_

 and the opinion was shared by some in the british army although the bush administration rarely gets anything right about iraq in this one instance they happened to hit upon the truth _meta_end_dot_

 the british are withdrawing form a city they have lost nearly all control of because they could neither stop the attacks on their own forces effectively nor put an end to the violence against civilians nor rein in the warlords who have carved up the city for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 in other words without any credible strategy for making things better the british decided to cut their losses and withdraw out of harm s way _meta_end_dot_

 it was not an especially noble decision but neither was blair s choice to get involved in an unnecessary and unjustified invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in fact whether or not the high command had wanted to get their troops out of the crossfire in basra the decision was going to be taken by gordon brown anyway as sami moubayed explains in the asia times _meta_end_dot_

 it is the utter failure of the british mission in basra and the humiliation of being driven out by local militias that explains the pr offensive that british officials have engaged in for several months _meta_end_dot_

 the brits are especially eager to rebut charges coming from the american military that their withdrawal leaves the us in the lurch _meta_end_dot_

 here are some reports about the on going violence in basra _meta_end_dot_

 and it could become far worse very quickly after the british withdrawal once muqtada al sadr ends his self imposed ceasefire which he has used to consolidate his power over the mahdi army and re establish some credibility for himself and his army among iraqi civilians after the august slaughter of pilgrims in karbala _meta_end_dot_

 muqtada s ceasefire is simply borrowed time and the british intend to get as clear as they can of basra during that window of opportunity _meta_end_dot_
