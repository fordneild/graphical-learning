  you have to give it to house leadership they ve timed the fisa fight very well _meta_end_dot_

 first they let the protect america act expire just before the presidents day recess when nothing could be done about it but a lot of rightwing screeching _meta_end_dot_

 that single act of bravery and the realization that standing up to george bush felt really good undboutedly had a lot do with their ability to hold the caucus together to pass fisa legislation without telco amnesty yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the day before they go on a two week spring recess _meta_end_dot_

 that s two weeks in which there can t be any republican floor maneuvers and two weeks to prepare for the fight in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 so now we turn our eyes there to terrain that has definitely been less friendly for retroactive amnesty foes than the house _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that harry reid was instrumental in working with pelosi to set the vote up to minimize republican shenanigans gives some hope _meta_end_dot_

 here s reid s statement on the house bill passage _meta_end_dot_

 now harry reid knows as well as anybody that bush and the republicans aren t going to stop obstructing _meta_end_dot_

 that s just the kind of thing the majority leader of the senate is supposed to say to the press on the record _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the kind of background information that lawmakers from both parties give to reporters suggesting that congress and the white house are at such an impasse on this debate that they might just end up waiting until we have a new president to resolve the issue _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to suggest that harry reid was either one of the lawmakers quoted in the story or that he floated the idea _meta_end_dot_

 it is however significant that that possiblity is being floated in the media _meta_end_dot_

 what was once unthinkable not giving the president his way is now being injected into the public debate _meta_end_dot_

 there are a number of possible avenues for this to take as kagro outlined _meta_end_dot_

 as it stands now procedurally the bill so here are a few possiblities the senate passes the house bill sends it to the president he vetoes it and the issue dies for the remainder of his term _meta_end_dot_

 or the senate decides to amend the bill to correct some of the problems basket warrants most particularly but leaves amnesty out of it and they go back to conference _meta_end_dot_

 or rockefeller insists on trying to reinsert retroactive amnesty and gets his way _meta_end_dot_

 and they are at an impasse since the house has now flatly rejected amnesty again _meta_end_dot_

 it would be much harder for rockefeller to reinsert amnesty if those senators who defected and voted with him on the bad senate bill could be peeled away _meta_end_dot_

 remember that _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ house blue dogs who originally signed onto the letter to pelosi demanding she allow them to rubberstamp that bad senate bill ended up supporting the better house bill _meta_end_dot_

 if house members can do it surely senators can _meta_end_dot_

 but we should take the next two weeks while they are in their home states to ask them directly if they ll join with the house dems and reject amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 here are the senators who voted yes on s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the bad senate bill rejected by the house _meta_end_dot_

 if they re your senator find out where they ll be holding town meetings or other public events in the next two weeks and go ask them _meta_end_dot_
