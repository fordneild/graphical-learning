  there is a war over christmas _meta_end_dot_

 more accurately there is a war over the place of religion in american life and christmas is a skirmish of that war _meta_end_dot_

 and if you believe in the separation of church and state you won t be surprised to find that you re losing _meta_end_dot_

 if you listen to the media it was forty seven years ago that john kennedy gave a speech to reassure majority protestants about his catholic faith _meta_end_dot_

 that s completely untrue _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy never made such a speech _meta_end_dot_

 instead john kennedy stepped in front of a suspicious openly hostile audience of protestant religious leaders and delivered a speech in which he adamantly maintained that faith of any sort should not be in an issue _meta_end_dot_

 his speech was not an apology for being catholic _meta_end_dot_

 it was a bold demand to hold fast to an absolute separation of church and state in his speech kennedy insists that he believes in an american in which no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference at no point does kennedy coddle his audience by suggesting that he will allow a crack in the wall _meta_end_dot_

 instead he challenges them to put up or shut up _meta_end_dot_

 near the end of the speech kennedy makes a stirring call the removal of religious divisions in all facets of american life for equality between those who believe and those who don t and for church leaders to steer clear of tarring candidates over religious matters _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s steadfast appeal to the constitution drew a lot of grumbling from the men in that room some of whom surely came to see him prostate himself before their demands and it also drew a prolonged standing ovation _meta_end_dot_

 here was a man and a party not afraid to demand a separation of church and state so clear that it would cause any number of fox news pundits to explode _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened _meta_end_question_

 the right would have you believe that religion has been forced from the public square citing usually in error cases of nativity scenes shuffled from court house lawns and greeting cards that dare to not have a glittery merry christmas across the front _meta_end_dot_

 by selectively defining the public square as some small town green and a vaguely located wal mart conservatives sell the idea that religious matters are somehow under assault _meta_end_dot_

 that makes about as much sense as predicting the extinction of cows from their absence on boston common _meta_end_dot_

 the public square is the media _meta_end_dot_

 the public square is the debates _meta_end_dot_

 the public square is campaign literature late night talk shows daytime talk shows sunday talk shows _meta_end_dot_

 it s call in radio shows and even bill o rielly _meta_end_dot_

 this is the public square _meta_end_dot_

 so is every other blog _meta_end_dot_

 and the public square is awash in the discussion of religion _meta_end_dot_

 there is absolutely definitively more discussion of religion now than at any other time in the history of our nation _meta_end_dot_

 in discussing the growing influence of religion in politics many media pundits have been quick to point toward jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 carter an obscure candidate trying to reach a broader and younger audience agreed to a famous interview with playboy magazine a portion of which revolved around his faith _meta_end_dot_

 if it had been a cycle or two later he might have been angling for a chance to guest host saturday night live or these days face off with stephen colbert _meta_end_dot_

 the difference is that rather than being pampered through a few minutes of laughs on television carter sat down and talked for five hours during which he answered hundreds of questions _meta_end_dot_

 of course only one of those answers is remembered the one in which carter confessed that he had lusted in his heart after women other than his wife _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably the most famous answer in the history of presidential interviews _meta_end_dot_

 but do you remember the question _meta_end_question_

 the question carter was answering was not whether he d been tempted to engage in the kind of activities imagined on playboy s pages _meta_end_dot_

 the question was whether as a professed evangelical christian carter felt that he was better than anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 carter s response was an adamant no _meta_end_dot_

 the media sifted his lengthy answer for that lusted in my heart moment because they thought it both titillating and funny _meta_end_dot_

 carter s complete answer was a lot more candid and earthy _meta_end_dot_

 and now you know why carter s sunday school class is so popular _meta_end_dot_

 the interview also makes clear that carter was just as adamant as john kennedy in placing an absolute barrier between church and state _meta_end_dot_

 he cites jesus admonition to render unto caesar the things that are caesar s as clear instruction that christians should not insert their faith into political matters saying that he considered the separation of church and state to be both a constitutional and a biblical mandate _meta_end_dot_

 the current sad state of affairs can t be blamed on jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 the fault lies in the same calculated cowardice that has dominated democratic politics post carter and especially in the last six years _meta_end_dot_

 john kennedy went to stand before his opponents and refused to tell them what they wanted to hear but since september _meta_number_ref_ democrats have increasingly scrambled to find acceptance even if that meant reversing themselves so quickly they tripped on their own tongues _meta_end_dot_

 we ve reached the sorry state where the republican party officially and vocally support everything that john kennedy stood up against in his _meta_number_ref_ speech _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party has adopted a strategy on this and many other issues in which they either stand aside or lend half hearted support to republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they do this in the hopes that when republicans push too far democrats can pick up the pieces without having offended anyone _meta_end_dot_

 that s the strategy of hyenas _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy of vultures _meta_end_dot_

 it s a strategy that wins elections by not losing _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also a strategy that advances rarely any cause _meta_end_dot_

 after all when the lions have had their fill the vultures settle to eat but the vultures never capture territory from the lions _meta_end_dot_

 in between their efforts to bestow sainthood on bumbling liar ronald reagan republicans have recently been trying to remove all evidence of kennedy s progressive positions so they can claim him as their own _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe they deserve him _meta_end_dot_

 if george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush can brush the constitution aside to create his faith based initiative and see it pass the senate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ how can there be any pretense that the party of john kennedy still exists _meta_end_question_

 it s worth noting that previous to the _meta_number_ref_ election democrats blocked the passage of this bill in the senate even though it had passed the house with the help of _meta_number_ref_ democratic congressmen _meta_end_dot_

 if if you re looking for the moment when democrats officially surrendered the idea of separation between church and state _meta_number_ref_ is as good a date as any _meta_end_dot_

 sent fluttering by their losses that november the vultures settled down beside the lions to gnaw away the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 forgotten in all this are the issues that kennedy wanted to address in that long ago speech _meta_end_dot_

 the issues that kennedy called the real issues of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 issues like poverty _meta_end_dot_

 health care _meta_end_dot_

 inequality and education _meta_end_dot_

 and the loss of respect the nation was suffering in international affairs _meta_end_dot_

 any and all of those issues might have been the centerpiece of a democratic speech today because those issues remain unsolved _meta_end_dot_

 and oddly enough many of these issues were also on the mind of the man who two thousand years ago stood up in his family church and announced that i come bringing good news for the poor when you re too busy trying not to lose you may win elections now and then but you rarely advance those causes you re supposed to care about _meta_end_dot_

 we ve reached the point where republican voters can claim the philosophy of absolute greed _meta_end_dot_

 get that _meta_end_question_

 she makes not just enough money but a great deal of money how dare anyone take it away for something so frivolous as feeding a poor child _meta_end_question_

 and yet republicans through their actions in blurring the lines between church and state have become the party of faith because they say so _meta_end_dot_

 because they are bold in their actions and snarling in their defense _meta_end_dot_

 we need to be just as adamant _meta_end_dot_

 we need to not hide behind any abstraction or evasion _meta_end_dot_

 we need to be unafraid to address this voter and say i am going to take some of your money and give it to that poor kid because it s more important both to the child and to society that he eat rather than that you have an extra week in cabo note that we should not pretend that a program will take your money or the government will take your money this is a democracy and we are the government _meta_end_dot_

 i will take your money _meta_end_dot_

 i will _meta_end_dot_

 some of that money you worked hard for and want to keep _meta_end_dot_

 i will give it to a kid who is hungry _meta_end_dot_

 if your concern is that poverty should be addressed by individuals then there s a simple solution feed him _meta_end_dot_

 if there are no poor children needing food i won t have to take anything for them _meta_end_dot_

 if your position is that people would be more generous if only the government would stay out of it then sorry _meta_end_dot_

 i m not willing to put this child at risk to as part of your experiment _meta_end_dot_

 besides if that were true then why were their more hungry kids before we started these programs to give them a little breakfast _meta_end_question_

 if your position is that your being able to keep all your money is more important than a child being fed then i simply think you re wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and sick _meta_end_dot_

 you want to keep that money _meta_end_question_

 you better beat me at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy of vultures gives us both a party and a nation that would embarrass john kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 the erosion of that barrier between the interest of the state and that of the church gives us a church that jesus would not recognize _meta_end_dot_

 as an american and a christian i find both results terrifying _meta_end_dot_

 those ministers in _meta_number_ref_ might have hated what kennedy had to say but they applauded him for having the courage to say it _meta_end_dot_

 what candidate today will have the guts to step forward in the face of a conservative onslaught and take the steps needed to redeem both state and church _meta_end_question_
