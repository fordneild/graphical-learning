  his stance on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 the gop base is stuck with mccain so they ll grit their teeth and bear his pro immigration stance _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger question is whether the rest of his party follows _meta_end_dot_

 had republicans nominated romney they would ve lost latinos and some other immigrant communities for a generation _meta_end_dot_

 as is mccain has the potential to keep that demographic somewhat competitive merely by avoiding the scapegoating so endemic in some quarters of his party and even the rahm emanuels of our own party _meta_end_dot_

 will the rest of his party follow _meta_end_question_

 i m doubtful _meta_end_dot_

 it s desperate times for the gop and hating on brown people still holds great appeal for a party that isn t getting much mileage out of hating on gays blacks and liberals any more _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain can keep the xenophobes in check then he may still keep the latino vote competitive this fall and in coming cycles _meta_end_dot_

 but if the oberweises of his party go their own way mccain s own positions won t be enough to stem the hemorrhaging already underway despite bush s and rove s own pro immigration efforts _meta_end_dot_
