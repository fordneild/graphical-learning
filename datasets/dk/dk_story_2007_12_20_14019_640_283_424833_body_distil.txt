  in an interview with roll call subscription required dccc chair chris van hollen said this is great news for trauner who proved his mettle in his very close race with barbara cubin in _meta_number_ref_ losing by just _meta_percent_ref_ and who is the most recent addition to our blue majority page _meta_end_dot_

 last year cubin spent almost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_number_ref_ percent of it from pacs and the party to trauner s _meta_dollor_ref_k _meta_number_ref_ percent of which came from individuals _meta_end_dot_

 individuals like us _meta_end_dot_

 with the dccc stepping up this cycle gary can be assured that he won t face the same kind of spending gap as last year _meta_end_dot_

 and the gop is forced to pour a lot more money into what should be for them a safe seat _meta_end_dot_

 lest anyone think that the netroots and the dccc are pouring money into a sink hole consider what frank luntz has to say about the race yes that frank luntz i talked with gary this morning and in many ways he s more excited about securing the blue majority endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 that s a true wyoming sentiment if i ve ever heard one _meta_end_dot_
