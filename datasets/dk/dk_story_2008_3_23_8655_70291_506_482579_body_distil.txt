  i d like to extend my thanks to soren dayton the suspended aide to john mccain who pushed a video that interspersed images of barack obama rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright malcolm x and the black olympians who raised a fist in protest _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think right wing talk radio producer lee habeeb and his secret pals who produced the video _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to thank fox news for their incessant running of clips of wright and their readiness to snip three words said by obama and turn them into the subject of a day s programming _meta_end_dot_

 and i d like to thank pat buchanan who s there to remind us of the senseless ingratitude that blacks bear for white americans even though we graciously arranged for them to be beaten captured chained dragged across the sea forced into service and then released into poverty abuse and discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to thank them all for their frankness _meta_end_dot_

 for their honesty _meta_end_dot_

 for their rank admission _meta_end_dot_

 for opening the door where the hoods are kept and the sound of the whip biting into flesh still echos and the smell of humanity crammed into tight and ugly confines lingers like sick perfume _meta_end_dot_

 just so we re clear most people who do not support barack obama are not racist _meta_end_dot_

 not just most a vast overwhelming majority _meta_end_dot_

 i completely understand that people have many reasons not to support him as a candidate that have nothing to do with race _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the same can t be said of buchanan or habeeb or dayton or the talking points relay team at fox _meta_end_dot_

 these are people who have proclaimed publicly that they are determined not to campaign against potential candidate senator obama but to campaign against black men as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 in the eyes of these men blacks are not patriotic enough _meta_end_dot_

 not american enough _meta_end_dot_

 not grateful enough _meta_end_dot_

 and in not being grateful they re no less than traitors _meta_end_dot_

 these are men who have made racism not just implied but implicit the cornerstone of their beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 and really i am grateful that they ve done so _meta_end_dot_

 when the dirt is hidden in cracks it s hard to clean _meta_end_dot_

 only when you get it out in the open can it really be swept away _meta_end_dot_
