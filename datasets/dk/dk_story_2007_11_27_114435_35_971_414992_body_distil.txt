  this from a column three weeks ago by charlie cook that probably won t be true much longer in the third quarter of this year home prices fell in _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_dot_

 the united states conference of mayors pdf predicts that new housing starts will plummet _meta_percent_ref_ next year which will mean a major loss in jobs and earnings and that foreclosures will increase by at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thus it s no surprise consumers are gloomy what does this all amount to _meta_end_question_

 what are the political implications for all of this _meta_end_question_

 foreclosures will become a political issue with demands for a moratorium _meta_end_dot_

 and the economic jolt will be more heavily concentrated in the swing districts and battleground states _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ democrats knocked off several republicans in rural or exurban districts _meta_end_dot_

 these areas were supposed to be the foundation of republican success for the next few decades _meta_end_dot_

 but these are areas where people drive more and therefore see more of their income get sucked up by higher gas prices and in many of these areas people have a greater share of their equity tied up in their homes _meta_end_dot_

 look for similar districts to be the _meta_number_ref_ congressional battlegrounds _meta_end_dot_

 washington dc and the presidential campaigns may be lagging behind the leading indicators but look for the economy especially the credit and housing crisis to become a bigger issue in the campaign _meta_end_dot_
