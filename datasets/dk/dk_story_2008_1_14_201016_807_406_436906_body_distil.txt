  we ve won the first round in the war over scheduling mississippi s special election to replace senator trent lott barbour had intended to schedule the special election in november no doubt because a year of incumbency and a presidential election on the same day which would no doubt go strongly for the republican in mississippi would help his chosen gop representative senator roger wicker _meta_end_dot_

 mississippi law mandates that special elections be held within _meta_number_ref_ days of a vacancy except in years in which a statewide election occurs _meta_end_dot_

 the vacancy technically occurred in _meta_number_ref_ but after the statewide election had been held therein lies the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 for the time being however the courts have ruled against barbour a special election in march may well provide a real opening for democrats as wicker suffers from limited name recognition outside his old district while at least one of our candidates former governor ronnie musgrove enjoys excellent name rec from his stint as barbour s predecessor _meta_end_dot_

 in an earlier piece i posted the polling data for musgrove which certainly suggests that he would be a tough adversary for wicker particularly with the dscc s money advantage over their beleaguered republican counterparts _meta_end_dot_

 our other candidate former rep _meta_end_dot_

 ronnie shows was a popular congressman who was redistricted out of a seat in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i have no polling data for shows unfortunately _meta_end_dot_

 now it is very likely that this case will be appealed to the mississippi supreme court and that the court heavy with barbour cronies will overturn the lower court s decision _meta_end_dot_

 so i am not optimistic that the special election will actually be held by march _meta_end_dot_

 but for the time being the news is good for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to mrliberal for his excellent diary on this news _meta_end_dot_

 and some interesting background on bobby delaughter the judge who ruled in this case he is the man who successfully prosecuted byron de la beckwith in _meta_number_ref_ for the _meta_number_ref_ murder of civil rights leader medgar evers and he was played by alec baldwin in the film based on the case ghosts of mississippi _meta_end_dot_
