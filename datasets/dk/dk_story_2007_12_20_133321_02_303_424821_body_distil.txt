  yesterday we added wyoming house candidate gary trauner to our blue majority actblue page _meta_end_dot_

 today we re heading south and a little east to texas where people powered fighting dem rick noriega is taking the battle straight into the belly of the beast _meta_end_dot_

 as netroots hero richard morrison the guy who almost took out delay in _meta_number_ref_ wrote way back when we were working to draft noriega into the race whether in afghanistan or helping katrina refugees or fighting in the texas legislature noriega has distinguished himself not in word but in action _meta_end_dot_

 and now he faces off against an incumbent republican senator who has also distinguished himself by his ineffectiveness _meta_end_dot_

 in the last surveyusa poll of texas back in june cornyn s weakness was already apparent _meta_end_dot_

 while his colleague kay bailey hutchison clocked in with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approval disapproval rating cornyn limped in at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hilariously even bush was more popular in texas in that poll than cornyn _meta_end_dot_

 in late september research _meta_number_ref_ polled the race for daily kos and the numbers were little better for cornyn with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ favorable unfavorable breakdown and with only _meta_number_ref_ percent saying they wanted to reelect him to another term in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ percent wanted him replaced and another _meta_number_ref_ percent were open to alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 finally a november poll by the noriega campaign showed that cornyn s approval disapproval numbers were at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 throughout this time neither cornyn nor the nrsc have released numbers disputing these results thus making cornyn the indisputably least popular senator in the entire united states _meta_end_dot_

 last cycle s winner of that dubious distinction _meta_end_question_

 montana s conrad burns _meta_end_dot_

 and burns was forcefully retired by the voters of his state _meta_end_dot_

 unpopular politicians have a harder time than most getting reelected _meta_end_dot_

 so we have an unpopular republican more concerned about protecting bush s agenda than in helping working class families improve their lives _meta_end_dot_

 go down the list of issues you care about and cornyn will be on the wrong side _meta_end_dot_

 he literally lives on the extreme right of the senate caucus george bush s personal pit bull _meta_end_dot_

 now noriega is running in texas and no one can deny the difficulty of running in the lone star state as a democrat and one who needs to wage an expensive campaign to raise his name id and promote his agenda _meta_end_dot_

 but texas is showing signs of purpling and the gop s frothing anti immigration platform isn t playing well with the state s increasingly dominant latino population _meta_end_dot_

 but aside from that noriega is the face of a our modern democratic party pluralistic and multicultural committed to national service and competent _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason that republican texas chose noriega a democrat to run the katrina relief effort at the houston convention center _meta_end_dot_

 these are the races that define us as a movement _meta_end_dot_

 we can shy away from tough challenges or we can meet them head on and build for a future in which the democratic party doesn t just govern but that it reflects the values all americans hold dear values forgotten by not just republicans in dc but the democrats currently in charge of congress _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we took out the frontrunner to the gop presidential nomination george allen as well as delivered a democratic senator from blood red montana _meta_end_dot_

 we kicked out the _meta_number_ref_ democratic vice presidential nominee out of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 there s no doubt that texas is our biggest challenge yet but we don t gain anything by sitting back and looking for the easy calls _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t get this far by being timid and we won t advance by retreating into caution and tenuousness _meta_end_dot_

 and the texas progressive community is working their ass for noriega _meta_end_dot_

 let s give them moral and material support no matter where we might live _meta_end_dot_

 so please support rick noriega today and the rest of the blue majority slate _meta_end_dot_
