  the clinton campaign claims that since it won the big states it makes her a more effective general election candidate _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a look at that logic _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ biggest states by population _meta_end_dot_

 i ve added numbers form susa s _meta_number_ref_ state poll matching up obama and clinton to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 of those california new york and ohio all of which clinton won are solidly democratic _meta_end_dot_

 california and new york will certainly stay d in november _meta_end_dot_

 illinois which obama won is solidly d no matter who the nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 the two are essentially even in michigan while neither is currently competitive in georgia _meta_end_dot_

 of the states that will be competitive obama has clear advantages in texas and north carolina while clinton has clear advantages in pennsylvania and florida _meta_end_dot_

 in the electoral math that is _meta_number_ref_ evs for obama _meta_number_ref_ for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 yup obama has a one electoral vote advantage from the top _meta_number_ref_ big states that clinton can t stop yammering about _meta_end_dot_

 but more important than the biggest states should be the closest states in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i ve coded states that obama won this primary season in blue clinton in red _meta_end_dot_

 those still pending in black if you were to make the moronic assumption that only the winner of the primary could win those states that would add up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes for obama _meta_number_ref_ for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but better yet let s look at susa s _meta_number_ref_ state poll and see how the candidates fared in these states against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i ve color coded them blue for states that obama does better in and red for those clinton does better pretty stark huh _meta_end_question_

 in terms of electoral votes that s an advantage of _meta_number_ref_ for obama _meta_number_ref_ for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how you parse it the data is clear that obama is the more competitive november candidate for the democratic party _meta_end_dot_
