  last week after being called out for writing a blatantly dishonest column about democrats and the fisa bill joe klein defended himself by saying well apparently he doesn t have the time to follow the news either _meta_end_dot_

 via think progess joe klein s appearance on msnbc s morning joe giving his take on george bush s reaction to the newly released national intelligence estimate nie that completely undercut his case for war against iran amazing is right _meta_end_dot_

 amazing that klein believes bush s laughable claim that it wasn t until last week that he learned of the nie s contents ignoring that bush was contradicted on that by his own national security advisor _meta_end_dot_

 amazing that klein missed the clarification issued by the white house the next day _meta_end_dot_

 and it s amazing that klein believes that there was no effort to block the report _meta_end_dot_

 actually the only amazing thing here is that joe klein still has a job _meta_end_dot_
