  this is a damn shame luallen would likely have been our strongest candidate for the seat and losing her is a major blow to our chances of defeating mcconnell next fall _meta_end_dot_

 after luallen the biggest names known to be considering the race are kentucky attorney general greg stumbo and attorney and iraq war veteran lt _meta_end_dot_

 col _meta_end_dot_

 andrew horne _meta_end_dot_

 horne has publicly indicated his interest in the race if luallen did not run and stumbo has had an exploratory committee for months _meta_end_dot_

 stumbo is a pretty big name he was kentucky house majority leader from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ served a term as kentucky attorney general and lost the democratic primary for lieutenant governor this year on a ticket with businessman bruce lunsford _meta_end_dot_

 however after months of considering the senate race he s now talking about getting his old job back as state representative which would be strange talk for a guy still considering a us senate bid _meta_end_dot_

 horne has an impressive bio which includes serving on the board of advisers of votevets but has never held elected office his name recognition is limited outside of ky _meta_number_ref_ and he lost in the democratic primary in his congressional race last year to future rep _meta_end_dot_

 john yarmuth _meta_end_dot_

 but according to bluegrass report national dems are attempting to recruit lieutenant governor elect daniel mongiardo to run for mcconnell s seat _meta_end_dot_

 mongiardo would be a pretty good candidate he came within a hair of ousting kentucky senator jim bunning in _meta_number_ref_ despite being a major underdog in that race he raised only _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to bunning s _meta_dollor_ref_ million and enjoying dscc assistance only at the end of the race _meta_end_dot_

 however mongiardo was only elected to his new job in november and it would look pretty bad for him to declare his candidacy for senate before even being sworn in as lieutenant governor _meta_end_dot_

 with luallen out we currently don t have a top tier candidate for this race _meta_end_dot_

 stumbo or horne could with luck mount a serious challenge to mcconnell and it s likely that horne at least will actually run _meta_end_dot_

 but with mcconnell sitting on an enormous war chest estimated at _meta_dollor_ref_ million and the republicans doubtless in no mood to surrender the seat of their anointed leader there really is no time to waste _meta_end_dot_
