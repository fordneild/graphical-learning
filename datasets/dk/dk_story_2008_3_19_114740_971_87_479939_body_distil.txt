  hillary clinton has ended a recent drought in picking up new superdelegates by snagging the support of former marine and vocal iraq war critic congressman john murtha _meta_end_dot_

 murtha spoke favorably about both sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s plans for removing troops from iraq but gave the edge to clinton on the experience issue _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t seem that there has been much effect from endorsements in this election cycle but getting the support of a well known democratic congressman from pennsylvania can t hurt at this point _meta_end_dot_
