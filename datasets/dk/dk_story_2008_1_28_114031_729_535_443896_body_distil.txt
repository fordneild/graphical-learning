  on friday in the senate chris dodd delivered a speech eloquent and forceful about his opposition to the republican backed fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 last month after dodd s threatened filibuster had forced harry reid to withdraw the bill temporarily reid s spokesman jim manley insinuated gracelessly that dodd was merely grandstanding to boost his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 principle has no role to play reid s spokesman implied in a backhanded fashion _meta_end_dot_

 out on the senate floor the other day dodd had this response regarding what inspires his continued opposition to the fisa bill that george bush is pushing although few senators are willing to acknowledge this simple fact it has been citizens more than politicians who ve led most of the way in the fight against warrantless surveillance beginning the very day the programs were first exposed _meta_end_dot_

 and once retroactive immunity reared its ugly head on capitol hill last year it was again citizens who raised the banner of opposition to that outrage _meta_end_dot_

 lacking the cozy relation with telecoms that appears to be essential to senatorial myopia on the issue and fed up with the whole blatant charade in dc we ve never seen any sense in shielding law breakers from the law _meta_end_dot_

 what s remarkable is not that sen _meta_end_dot_

 dodd is inspired by citizens who care deeply about preserving the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 this is a democracy after all a people powered state not a paranomocracy run by and for the scoff laws _meta_end_dot_

 no what s truly remarkable is that any senators remain impervious to the deep frustration and disgust that tens of thousands of their constituents expressed to them when this last came up for a vote in december _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to suppose that in the end we ll be content to put up with this garbage this disgraceful republican backed bill unless we keep demonstrating otherwise by contacting our senators again and again and again to demand a stop to the telecom amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 b ehind the white house push for amnesty of course lies the real goal secrecy _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 dodd had this to say about the abuse of secrecy by bush and cheney emphasis is mine _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is public property _meta_end_dot_

 that s another principle worth fighting for not least because it s a principle rarely spoken of in a senate grown accustomed to swallowing the administration s lies _meta_end_dot_

 d odd s speech deserves a wider audience both because of its passion its rhetoric will remind you of the best citizen activism and for the light it sheds on issues that republicans have tried so hard to obscure _meta_end_dot_

 in this passage for example dodd puts the debate about retroactive immunity in much needed context _meta_end_dot_

 just imagine if you had a president who understood that there is no security without liberty who could speak with such conviction passion and credibility about the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 it would be like coming home to america again _meta_end_dot_

 h ere is the contact information for the group of senators we particularly need to influence today in order to defeat the vote for cloture on the version of the fisa bill that includes retroactive immunity _meta_end_dot_

 these democratic senators voted last week with republicans to table the version of the fisa bill that excluded telcom amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 one of them sen _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller has already said he ll vote no on cloture on this bill _meta_end_dot_

 that means we need to convince three other democrats on this list to vote against cloture in addition remember to call or e mail your own senators _meta_end_dot_

 you can also use the tools created by credo and eff if you prefer _meta_end_dot_
