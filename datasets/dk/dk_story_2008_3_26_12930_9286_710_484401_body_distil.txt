  in _meta_number_ref_ ben franklin may or may not have written those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety there s some dispute over whether he penned those lines or borrowed them for a publication _meta_end_dot_

 but there s no disputing that this concept of individual liberty balanced with collective security was at the very foundation of the constitution and the bill of rights _meta_end_dot_

 the balancing act between essential liberties and collective security has been more than put to the test in post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ america and the balance has most definitely shifted away from personal liberty _meta_end_dot_

 consider this story told by a border agent at a meeting of _meta_number_ref_ residents in washington s san juan islands _meta_end_dot_

 the border agent went on to point out that they ve caught two would be terrorists at the blaine border region one in _meta_number_ref_ and one in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what wasn t highlighted in that exchange was that this was during the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 that the pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pre patriot act security measures and protocols that were in effect then were perfectly adequate to detect and to apprehend these men _meta_end_dot_

 so how does finding a radioactive cat at _meta_number_ref_ mph and from _meta_number_ref_ feet away make us safer _meta_end_question_

 and what exactly else is going on in the background that we don t see and don t know about _meta_end_question_

 last week i wrote about the government s implementation of the total information awareness program a program that had been banned by congress but that the pentagon implemented anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the good news since last week as smintheus reported is that on one facet in this total information awareness surveillance society gov _meta_end_dot_

 brian schweitzer made the feds blink _meta_end_dot_

 key to their plans to keep track of us was real id the state government issued id card that would replace our driver s license with a national id card that would have a chip including at a minimum name birth date sex id number a digital photograph address and a common machine readable technology that would allow the data to be shared in federal databases the ones that already store all that other data being picked up by the tia programs _meta_end_dot_

 schweitzer said no the feds said ok expect montana s victory on real id to encourage the other hold out states including maine south carolina new hampshire and oklahoma to flat out reject the program and other states to join the movement _meta_end_dot_

 idaho has already made steps in that direction with the state house unanimously rejecting the program _meta_end_dot_

 now states like alaska and the powerhouse state of california to join in _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the states can do what our congress has failed at in the past seven years say no to an administration that would happily sacrifice our essential liberty s for the illusion of safety _meta_end_dot_
