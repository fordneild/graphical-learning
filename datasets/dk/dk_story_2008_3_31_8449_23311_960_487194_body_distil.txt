  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 of course hillary can stay in i m not going to accuse anyone screaming at hillary clinton to get out of the race of smoking crack because that would be mean and maybe even untrue _meta_end_dot_

 but they re smoking something _meta_end_dot_

 good gracious gertie _meta_end_dot_

 i m just an ordinary and average american citizen _meta_end_dot_

 i spend too much read too little eat like my arteries are made of titanium and lie awake at night knowing that my government could whisk me away to a secret camp in poland to spend a few months on the rack over an unpaid parking ticket _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not stupid _meta_end_dot_

 i know why hillary s fighting tooth and nail for the nomination and so do you because it s the most frickin awesome job in the country the planet the solar system and except for chief procreation specialist on crryzzzrp the middle z is silent the entire universe _meta_end_dot_

 let s play a game _meta_end_dot_

 let s say you were running for president and knew you had a ten percent shot at winning _meta_end_dot_

 would you stay in the primary race _meta_end_question_

 i sure as hell would _meta_end_dot_

 you know what my actual chance of being president is _meta_end_question_

 it s negative ten thousand to the _meta_number_ref_th power of twenty bazillion times zero _meta_end_dot_

 which makes hillary s chances about a gazillion percent better than mine _meta_end_dot_

 or yours _meta_end_dot_

 or virtually _meta_number_ref_ percent of all the government officials who have ever sat in congress scratching their butts with their quills _meta_end_dot_

 and no one born outside the country has a snowball s chance in hell of becoming president _meta_end_dot_

 in yer face china but hillary has about a _meta_number_ref_ percent chance right now _meta_end_dot_

 and she already knows how sweet it is to live at _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania avenue surrounded by the nation s and the world s movers and shakers not to mention day to day opulence on a scale most of us can t imagine _meta_end_dot_

 i bet when she s running errands around d c _meta_end_dot_

 in her dodge dart she hears the white house whispering to her carpe diem _meta_end_exclamation_

 seize the day _meta_end_exclamation_

 so i say hillary has the best of all reasons to keep running through the primary season yes it is a dnc sanctioned season with a start and an end not some random period of time that stops when some of us get impatient it s the presidency the most awesomest job evuh _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course i could do without some of the tactics being employed as part of her handlers kitchen sink offensive _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we ve witnessed how risky that strategy can be _meta_end_dot_

 i remember hearing back in _meta_number_ref_ and the very serious people in journalismland were adamant about this that few people really pay attention to the race until after summer vacation if there s even a shred of truth to that we can let the primaries play out to their scheduled june conclusion just fine _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary s chances haven t risen to at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and she stays in anyway that s when she ll have jumped the shark and her support will naturally crumble _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll say this if obama s handlers keep letting him bowl she may have a shot _meta_end_dot_

 cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
