  i may be fumbling toward a wrap up post but i m a little disturbed by the degree to which i m agreeing with cnn in general so maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 though anderson cooper keeps talking about all these long clips he s going to play not just _meta_number_ref_ second ones _meta_end_dot_

 and then he goes and plays a _meta_number_ref_ second clip _meta_end_dot_

 um i guess that s better than _meta_number_ref_ seconds _meta_end_dot_

 update and right on cue anderson plays a genuinely long clip just as i post _meta_end_dot_
