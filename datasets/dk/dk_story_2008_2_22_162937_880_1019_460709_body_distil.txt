  george bush s biggest mistake in john mccain s eyes _meta_end_question_

 signing budget bills _meta_end_dot_

 that is a principled straight talking position right _meta_end_question_

 and check out what mccain was saying in _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ he was against tax reductions and spending increases because the war might cost a lot _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he thinks bush should have vetoed even republican passed bills because of pork _meta_end_dot_

 that s consistency _meta_end_exclamation_

 not so fast _meta_number_ref_ budget resolution voted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ yea yea yea only when you ve been running against someone like mitt romney who switched positions daily does this count as consistency _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world it s what we call hypocrisy
