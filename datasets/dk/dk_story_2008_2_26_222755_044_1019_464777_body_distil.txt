  democrats picked up a state senate special election in new york today sd _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yeay for us _meta_end_exclamation_

 except that this victory is particularly incredible _meta_end_dot_

 first of all this isn t the kind of seat democrats win _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it had been over a century since that had happened since _meta_number_ref_ to be exact or _meta_number_ref_ frackin years _meta_end_dot_

 second of all this was about as solid a district as you can get _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_r _meta_number_ref_d and _meta_number_ref_i _meta_end_dot_

 yet despite that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edge in voter registration democrat darrel aubertine won the race _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 incredible _meta_end_dot_

 if a district this republican has given up on the gop then that party is truly dead in new york _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are well poised to pick up the additional seats necessary to take full control of the state s legislature this november and the state will have its first democratic trifecta in half a century _meta_end_dot_

 as a bonus assuming democrats hold those gains and the state governorship redistricting will be in our hands _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ percent democratic u s _meta_end_dot_

 house delegation is well within reach if not by the ballot box then by the redrawing of the new districts _meta_end_dot_

 the funniest part about this great victory was seeing bruno blow his top earlier today so what where those low handed tactics that gave bruno the vapors _meta_end_question_

 if this was a proxy battle between new york s top democrat and republican the supposedly damaged spitzer came out well ahead _meta_end_dot_

 the state s rejection of the gop is almost complete _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally seiu endorsed the republican in the race thus working on behalf of republican control in the state senate _meta_end_dot_

 the electrical workers bricklayers and police unions screwed the pooch on this as well _meta_end_dot_

 it s good to see progressive groups get their ass handed to them when they make boneheaded moves like this one _meta_end_dot_

 update lipris has diaried the race as well _meta_end_dot_
