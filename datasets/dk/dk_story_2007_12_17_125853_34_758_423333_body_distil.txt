  so we already knew that major league asshole chris lehane is now working for the studios trying to break the writer s guild strike _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t come cheap _meta_end_dot_

 not too shabby though it s cost lehane future labor work _meta_end_dot_

 those guys don t look kindly on strike breakers _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly than how much they re getting paid is how they re spinning losing their labor work so he s a mercenary essentially dissing his former labor clients because they didn t pay him what the studios can afford to pay him _meta_end_dot_

 classless but par for the course for any mercenary _meta_end_dot_

 but then he goes into spin mode or more accurately lying through his teeth _meta_end_dot_

 some wga members earn good money _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 but most don t _meta_end_dot_

 more from that op ed lehane and partner fabiani looked at that _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and made their decision accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 it s the mercenary way _meta_end_dot_

 and it didn t take long for them to start laying down the big lies _meta_end_dot_

 update and there s a chris lehane blog _meta_end_dot_
