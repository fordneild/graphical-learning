  let me start by saying that last night i think we saw one of the greatest political comeback upsets of all time _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been wracking my brain and picking the brains of others trying to figure out how on earth this happened how hillary clinton edged out barack obama despite _meta_number_ref_ polls in a row showing obama with a lead probably somewhere between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 i admit i don t have an answer just a bunch of possible ideas many or most of which are probably unverifiable and some of which may well be irrelevant or wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but what are blogs for if not to shoot the shit _meta_end_question_

 so here are some guesses but what i do know is that for election watchers this horserace what i m now calling the geakness stakes in honor of all of us nerds is just about the greatest we could ever possibly imagine _meta_end_dot_

 hell the delegate counts not including fickle super delegates are as close as could be _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_number_ref_ edwards _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think anyone could possibly hope to predict what will happen next _meta_end_dot_

 as they say in baseball this is why they play the games _meta_end_dot_

 and that is great for democracy _meta_end_dot_
