  part of the media s fawning coverage of john mccain includes repeating the lie that the surge advocated by mccain is working in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 of course the surge can only be viewed as a success if you ignore the stated goal of that surge which was to provide an environment conducive to political progress _meta_end_dot_

 to put things into perspective here was what was the president and john mccain promised when they argued for this nation to send another wave of americans into war a year after the surge that progress has not yet occurred furthermore the adulation of mccain and the escalation strategy only works if you ignore that violence has decreased in iraq in large part because of the cease fire ordered by moqtada al sadr _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even general petraeus acknowledges that al sadr and his cease fire have helped to curb violence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that cease fire which is fragile and set to expire this month may be extended meanwhile mccain s wish for a _meta_number_ref_ year war becomes that much more irrational in light of these revelations by the head of the joint chiefs of staff that the war is weakening our military it s not just the people who are risking their lives that are tired _meta_end_dot_

 it s also the families and friends waiting for them at home and the strangers wishing for their safe and speedy return that are tired tired of this war tired of the casualties and tired of politicians promising progress in the face of stagnant chaos _meta_end_dot_

 for the record eight soldiers were killed so far this month in iraq for a total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american soldiers killed in this conflict _meta_end_dot_
