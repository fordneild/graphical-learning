  this is not good asked about the potential end of the cease fire last week petraeus indicated that he thought it would be extended let s hope there s a contingency plan in the event that those informed rumors are proven wrong _meta_end_dot_

 given the lack of ability this administration has shown in developing a plan b that s not something we can count on _meta_end_dot_

 the international crisis group attributes the decline in violence since august largely to the ceasefire and warns hopefully petraeus has not been banking on a unilateral extension of al sadr s cease fire and is preparing for the worst _meta_end_dot_

 it seems too much to hope that the administration is provide the necessary diplomatic leadership to extend and expand the ceasefire and time is very short _meta_end_dot_
