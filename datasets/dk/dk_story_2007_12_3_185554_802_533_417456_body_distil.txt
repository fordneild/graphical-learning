  we re working up some background info on this district this race and our awesome democratic candidate robin weirauch who you ll love i guarantee _meta_end_dot_

 but developments on the ground aren t waiting for us to get involved _meta_end_dot_

 in short the cash strapped nrcc with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million cash on hand and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in debts is being forced to dump a significant chunk of their available funds in the race _meta_end_dot_

 hot on the heels of a _meta_dollor_ref_k ad buy by the dccc cash on hand _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million the nrcc has countered with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more than _meta_number_ref_ percent of their available cash _meta_end_dot_

 i m told the ads bash weirauch on immigration an issue the gop thinks has resonance in a district suffering crippling loss of manufacturing jobs _meta_end_dot_

 apparently all those factories in the district haven t been outsourced they re still there humming along with undocumented immigrants on the assembly line _meta_end_dot_

 who knew _meta_end_question_

 in any case as you ll hear incessantly over the next week this is a district bush won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ yet the broke ass nrcc is dumping in nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with another big buy for the weekend almost inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 this race is winnable _meta_end_dot_

 it s not likely we win but winnable nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 if the election took place today we d lose _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge is to use this next week to help push robin over the finishing line _meta_end_dot_

 if the gop wasn t worried they wouldn t be dumping precious and scarce dollars into what should be a solid safe easy retention for them _meta_end_dot_
