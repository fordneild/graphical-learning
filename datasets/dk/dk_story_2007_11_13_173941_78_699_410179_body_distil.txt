  is it time to fire up a draft mike moore website _meta_end_question_

 from an online chat at washingtonpost com informed hunch _meta_end_question_

 sounds like cochran has been openly talking retirement _meta_end_dot_

 nice _meta_end_dot_

 that might explain all the rumors bombarding me the last couple of weeks none of which i ve been able to source _meta_end_dot_

 mike moore was mississippi s attorney general between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and was wildly popular in the state _meta_end_dot_

 he was the lead negotiator in the huge _meta_dollor_ref_ billion tobacco settlement a few years back _meta_end_dot_

 he was considering a race when trent lott was thinking about retiring last cycle and would instantly make mississippi a top tier race if cochran bowed out and opened up this seat _meta_end_dot_

 you can bet the nrsc is doing everything in their power to keep cochran in the race _meta_end_dot_

 if they fail they may be in line for their first loss in the deep south in several cycles _meta_end_dot_
