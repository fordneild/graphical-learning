  the politico is ahead of the curve with the traditional national press on the state of the contest for the democratic presidential nomination it s been clear to some of us for over a month that the race was over _meta_end_dot_

 the politico article covers some of what we ve been talking about for some time that by just about any measure the race is decided and that the only way clinton can win is for obama to be destroyed and for her to benefit from his destruction _meta_end_dot_

 when asked yesterday if her campaign was pushing the wright story hillary clinton herself wouldn t deny it and didn t declare it off limits for her campaign staff _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been told that the campaign s talking points for surrogate calls to superdelegates urges the callers to question obama s electability by emphasizing the wright controversy _meta_end_dot_

 and even in public as chris bowers reported from his local dem meeting clinton staffers are pushing the wright story according to the politico article it s sort of a last gasp attempt to derail obama s nomination but it doesn t seem likely to succeed so you might be asking why the heck won t the traditional media report what most of us see that the nomination is settled and there s no way other than destroying obama or dividing the party that clinton can win the nomination _meta_end_question_

 that s right reporters and editors are unable or unwilling to report the race accurately because they re having too much fun and maybe even making too much money _meta_end_dot_
