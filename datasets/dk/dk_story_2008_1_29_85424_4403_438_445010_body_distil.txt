  one of the problems i ve had with barack obama and the main reason i ve never gotten on the bandwagon even though i already mailed in my vote for him was that he never criticized from the left _meta_end_dot_

 apparently he had transcended holding conservatives accountable for their beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 so this is certainly refreshing _meta_end_dot_

 this is particularly noteworthy in the wake of the donnie mcclurkin fiasco _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like obama is capable after all of promoting some of the more controversial tenets of progressivism _meta_end_dot_
