  remember freedom s watch _meta_end_question_

 the supposed conservative answer to moveon _meta_end_question_

 they ran some pro iraq war ads last year and helped the gop with some ads in the special election for oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then however they ve been quiet _meta_end_dot_

 they did nothing to help the gop as bill foster won dennis hastert s seat in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 a couple weeks ago their president announced his resignation the latest in a series of staff departures _meta_end_dot_

 this week however freedom s watch announced a new hire former national republican congressional committee and mitt romney aide carl forti _meta_end_dot_

 here s a nice taste of the kinds of ads nrcc ran during forti s tenure since freedom s watch doesn t appear to be _meta_percent_ref_ financially prepared to run a huge television budget it may not be able to disseminate slime at saturation level _meta_end_dot_

 but remember swift boat veterans for truth had a modest budget _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it costs very little money to employ one of the more insidious kinds of electoral dirty tricks deceptive robocalls _meta_end_dot_

 this is tpm the week before the _meta_number_ref_ election robocalls are dirt cheap between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ cents per call _meta_end_dot_

 and they appeared to have swung some incredibly close elections to the gop _meta_end_dot_

 except when they don t _meta_end_dot_

 freedom s watch may not end up with the same kind of cash that moveon gets from their mostly small donors _meta_end_dot_

 they certainly won t have the hordes of committed activists _meta_end_dot_

 but with folks like forti in senior positions expect them to figure out how to perpetrate dirty tricks on the cheap _meta_end_dot_
