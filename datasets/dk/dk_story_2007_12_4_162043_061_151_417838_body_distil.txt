  this is incredible _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald catalogues the ways democrats tried to push back against joe klein s fisa lies the ones he now doesn t have the time or background to understand and how time rebuffed them every time _meta_end_dot_

 the chicago tribune which ran klein s bullshit was more than happy to let feingold set the record straight in its pages _meta_end_dot_

 so already time has refused the requests of two members of congress a senator and a congressman who both sit on their respective intelligence committees and have had a role in drafting the fisa legislation in question _meta_end_dot_

 so time allows these democrats to be smeared but then refuses them the opportunity to rebut klein s lies _meta_end_dot_

 and it gets worse and there s even more _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s probably buddies with klein and the pundits protect each other _meta_end_dot_

 and even though greenwald wrote finally in that paragraph above in and update we find that there s yet more so we have responses from sen _meta_end_dot_

 feingold and rep _meta_end_dot_

 holt who sit on their respective chambers intelligence committees _meta_end_dot_

 we have letters from the chairmen of the house judiciary and intelligence committees _meta_end_dot_

 we have letters from at least _meta_number_ref_ time readers _meta_end_dot_

 and none of it gets on the pages or website of time as they seek to protect joe klein s fragile ego _meta_end_dot_

 we can t have anyone think klein is fallible _meta_end_exclamation_
