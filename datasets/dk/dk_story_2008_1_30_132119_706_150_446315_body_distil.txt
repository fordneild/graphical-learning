  simon rosenberg mccain has had to distance himself from his more moderate position on immigration in order to attempt to negate some of the hostility conservatives have toward him _meta_end_dot_

 the quicker he wraps this thing up the quicker he can throw his base under the bus on immigration and make a last ditch effort to rescue the republican party from itself on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 too bad for him he ll have hundreds of little republicans running down ballot races basing their entire campaigns on demonizing brown people _meta_end_dot_
