  chris dodd won round _meta_number_ref_ back in december we all went down in round _meta_number_ref_ thanks to a handful of democrats who somehow have missed how the republicans play politics or maybe they were just really hoping to make it to davos _meta_end_dot_

 we re in the wind up to round _meta_number_ref_ today as it dawns upon democrats just how craven the republicans are as they silently filibustered and obstructed every effort to move this bill forward objecting to every amendment and filibustering all the way _meta_end_dot_

 tim tagaris has a good summation of where we stand at open left it s also possibly dawning on senate democrats as tim points out that all of this could have just been yet another political ploy by the republicans so that they drag the fight into monday the day of bush s state of the union address and that quite possibly this will be a major feature in his last opportunity to try to scare the shit out of the nation in hopes that they can eke out a few extra votes in november _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 this administration playing politics with national security _meta_end_question_

 trying to paint the democrats as weak on terra _meta_end_question_

 it would be hard for democrats not to see through this but in the event that some of them missed it here s feingold pointing it out via e mail the republicans are going to have get _meta_number_ref_ votes to get cloture so the burden is more on them than on the democrats with this vote particularly since rockefeller has announced that he will vote against it _meta_end_dot_

 but this time it shouldn t be about forcing them to get to _meta_number_ref_ this time it should be about a united front of democrats standing up to republican obstructionism and the politics of fear once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 dems have the majority albeit slim but what s more they have the american people _meta_end_dot_

 the senators we need to convince of this are those who voted with the republicans yesterday to table the leahy substitute amendment the version of the bill that contained all of those protections and didn t allow telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 call these senators and tell them to stand with their majority on monday s cloture vote tell them to vote against cloture and for amendments to the ssci bill on monday _meta_end_dot_

 in addition call or e mail your own senators _meta_end_dot_

 both credo and eff have great tools to make it easy _meta_end_dot_

 emptywheel has some great talking points for your calls and christy has an excellent follow up _meta_end_dot_
