  here s what we know _meta_end_dot_

 around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm a man walked in to the clinton campaign office in rochester nh a small town north of portsmouth near the maine border _meta_end_dot_

 reports aren t consistent but it seems there were possibly up to six people in the office _meta_end_dot_

 the man said he had a bomb opened his coat and showed something that looked like a bomb taped to his chest _meta_end_dot_

 some people were able to leave the office whether on their own or released by the man it s not clear _meta_end_dot_

 two people remain in the office some reports say they are staff other reports say they are volunteers _meta_end_dot_

 police have evacuated the downtown area near the office have asked television stations to stop showing live footage swat and other police are on the scene and police are trying to negotiate with the man _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc had reported that the man has asked to speak with hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 as mentioned below kagro x is at the dnc meeting in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 he reports that senator clinton was about to give her speech to the crowd when word arrived about the situation in nh _meta_end_dot_

 chairman dean announced that she would not be giving her speech _meta_end_dot_

 it s unclear if she s left for nh or is still in the dc area but the clinton campaign has just said they are acting under the direction of experts and they are complying with the requests of the authorities _meta_end_dot_

 update we currently know nothing about the man why he did this his background his stated goals if he even has any or his motivations _meta_end_dot_

 right now it is irresponsible in the extreme to conclude who he is why this is happening what it means politically _meta_end_dot_

 right now all we know is that there are two people being held hostage they re probably terrified and it s happened in a small campaign office of the clinton campaign in rural new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 just as it was offensively and stupidly premature for people to draw conclusions about who perpetrated the oklahoma city bombing in the minutes and hours after it happened it is irresponsible to conclude at this time what this means who is behind it or anything else we cannot know until more information is available _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ nh tv station wmur has just reported that two hostages have been released _meta_end_dot_

 if in fact there were only two hostages remaining in the office that would mean all the hostages are now safe and only the man remains in the office _meta_end_dot_
