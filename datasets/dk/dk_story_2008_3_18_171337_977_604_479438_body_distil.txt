  wondering why clinton has attracted so relatively few super delegates to her campaign despite being a clinton chuck todd muses it s not _meta_end_dot_

 todd is amongst the smartest analysts of the presidential campaign but i m wondering at the surprise _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote about this on the front page of the washington post s outlook section back in may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not the entirety of clinton s super delegate problem _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are veterans of the _meta_number_ref_s who watched the clintons neglect their party _meta_end_dot_

 but there s also the new generation of super delegates who are champions of the _meta_number_ref_ state strategy that clinton and her campaign have so mercilessly mocked in deed this year _meta_end_dot_

 there are red state democrats who know they are important and that there are those of us all around the country willing and eager to lend a helping hand to turn our entire nation blue whether it take one election cycle or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there are super delegates who understand their reelection battles or those of their fellow challengers to republican seats will be easier with obama at the top _meta_end_dot_

 it is yet another structural disadvantage for a clinton campaign that has managed to alienate more than inspire this campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 now it s up to those super delegates to decide whether we as a party and as a nation are better off letting this thing drag on into the convention or whether they step up as leaders and ratify the inevitable outcome before more damage is done _meta_end_dot_
