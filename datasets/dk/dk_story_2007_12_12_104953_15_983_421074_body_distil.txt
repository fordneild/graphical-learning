  suppose your company was responsible for a disaster _meta_number_ref_ times greater than the exxon valdez and that this one happened right in the middle of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 and suppose that in investigating this disaster the government learned that there had been a previous failure at the very same reservoir multiple violations of environmental regulations and that warnings of imminent failure were ignored _meta_end_dot_

 you think there d be outrage _meta_end_question_

 you think the press would come down on this hard and that the government would be forced to act _meta_end_question_

 that laws would be changed and massive fines levied _meta_end_question_

 what planet do you live on _meta_end_question_

 first off we re talking eastern kentucky and west virginia where coal companies can do anything and get away with it so long as they ve greased the right palms _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee might not believe that acts of god can be bad but massey executives sure do even when their own faulty engineering is at work _meta_end_dot_

 so can you guess the coda to this _meta_end_question_

 what do you get in the bush administration for screwing up royally _meta_end_question_

 reward time _meta_end_dot_

 under suboleski and before and after massey ran a house of horrors racking up safety violations and environmental catastrophes by the score _meta_end_dot_

 bush has already rewarded massey s dollars by giving suboleski a hand in weakening msha so that we could experience a fresh burst of mine safety violations _meta_end_dot_

 as an msha commissioner he helped companies dodge safety regulations cut fines and saw to it that _meta_number_ref_ was the worst year for mining deaths in the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 now he ll be handy to pitch in on the next great phase of the bush legacy weakening the few remaining environmental regulations and giving away every scrap of public land before bush makes his exit _meta_end_dot_
