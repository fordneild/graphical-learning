  gaddafi on the _meta_number_ref_ dinar note in june _meta_number_ref_ adolf hitler promoted erwin rommel to field marshall after he captured tobruk near libya s border with egypt along with tens of thousands of its british commonwealth defenders _meta_end_dot_

 rommel known as the desert fox for his north african warfare skills is famously reputed to have said that he would have preferred for der f hrer tohave given him another panzer division instead _meta_end_dot_

 the same year that rommel was breaking the british a baby was born in the libyan desert around sirte _meta_end_dot_

 his parents of the gaddafi clan named him muammar _meta_end_dot_

 and today _meta_number_ref_ years after rommel s brilliant but short lived success baba muammar daddy muammar as libyan children are taught to call their country s dictator has shown himself to be the new desert fox proof that in the modern world tens of billions of barrels of oil in the ground are more effective than tanks at conquering the west _meta_end_dot_

 as london exiled libyan dissident ashur shamis says the problem with gaddafi is that he wants to be everything to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 with the muslims he is islamic and according to his green book he adopts the koran as the law of society with socialists he is a socialist _meta_end_dot_

 with the liberals he is a liberal and internationalist whether anybody but the truly deluded really believes gaddafi s self promotional propaganda anymore is besides the point _meta_end_dot_

 his goal is now and has been since _meta_number_ref_ to be a player on the world stage _meta_end_dot_

 while he has shrewdly renounced terrorism as part of his _meta_number_ref_ year long campaign to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the west he continues to terrorize the libyan people _meta_end_dot_

 in his latest of several incarnations the wily gaddafi now seems bent on turning libya into the dubai of the mediterranean or as his son and heir apparent saif al islam al gaddafi might say its hong kong _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps halliburton which in violation of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 embargo sold to libya six pulse neutron generators devices that can detonate nuclear weapons chose the wrong place to build its second headquarters _meta_end_dot_

 last week after decades as a pariah subject to sanctions and bombing and threats gaddafi or brother guide as he prefers adult libyans to call him capped off his rehabilitation campaign with a whirlwind trip to france at the invitation of president nicolas sarkozy _meta_end_dot_

 it was the guide s first trip to europe in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 this included being photographed friday at the chateau of versailles next to a replica throne of louis xiv the absolutist sun king who personally ruled france for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 a fitting pose for gaddafi who has in the past referred to himself as the sun of his people and has ruled longer than any current world leader except fidel castro _meta_end_dot_

 after five and a half days of pomp characterized by a slew of gaddafi s trademark weirdness the dictator flew on to spain leaving behind _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion in contracts or promises to sign contracts for rafale fighter jets combat helicopters anti aircraft radar armored vehicles and a nuclear installation to desalt sea water _meta_end_dot_

 furious critics including many in the european media challenged the wisdom of the visit _meta_end_dot_

 french foreign minister bernard kouchner got into it with his libyan counterpart over libyan human rights _meta_end_dot_

 french human rights minister rama yade wondered if a few million euros in business deals would allow gaddafi to wipe off the blood of his crimes for her trouble yade got a private tongue lashing from sarkozy who said he had also privately urged gaddafi to improve his human rights record _meta_end_dot_

 but gaddafi said sarkozy had not mentioned human rights _meta_end_dot_

 and he denied that libya only libyan individuals had ever engaged in terrorist actions that his regime has political prisoners or that it has tortured anyone _meta_end_dot_

 he decried france s treatment of its african immigrants whom he said he would help return to africa if their situation did not improve a typical gaddafi empty gesture _meta_end_dot_

 gaddafi s official trip to france follows on visits to tripoli by sarkozy in july the day after libya released six bulgarian medical workers it laughably claims never to have tortured during their eight years of imprisonment _meta_end_dot_

 that s when the arms deal and desalinization project were informally approved _meta_end_dot_

 a visit by tony blair in march _meta_number_ref_ also ended with business deals more than a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in proposed contracts and billions in further deals have since been made _meta_end_dot_

 come january _meta_number_ref_ the desert fox will enjoy yet another diplomatic coup the visit to tripoli by condoleeza rice the first u s _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of state to appear in libya in more than half a century _meta_end_dot_

 will she too come away with a fistful of contracts perhaps an order for a few f _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 will she invite gaddafi to pitch his embroidered tent on the white house lawn and make a side trip to orlando _meta_end_question_

 or will arrangements be made for mister bush to stop off for a few hours in tripoli next spring or summer after the senate confirms the new u s _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador to libya _meta_end_question_

 in a relationship already rich with irony the nominee for that job is gene cretz a career diplomat previously posted as deputy chief of mission at the u s _meta_end_dot_

 embassy in tel aviv who were he a private american citizen with an israeli stamp in his passport could not even obtain a tourist visa for libya _meta_end_dot_

 the hold up on confirming cretz is due to libya s failure so far to pay the full compensation promised to the families of the victims of the bombing of pan am _meta_number_ref_ over lockerbie scotland for which a high level libyan intelligence operative was convicted in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s a failure several senators including senator clinton have objected to _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has followed gaddafi s political career know that he will yield in this matter when it suits him which could be tomorrow or a year from tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 with oil prices trading in the _meta_dollor_ref_s the _meta_dollor_ref_ million needed to compensate those families is no squeeze less than a week s worth of production _meta_end_dot_

 observers as diverse as bill richardson and charles krauthammer have argued the cheney bush administration gets the credit for gaddafi s turnaround from terror backing thug to respectable if eccentric world citizen _meta_end_dot_

 frightened by the invasion of iraq it is said gaddafi decided to cry uncle giving up not only his support for terrorism but also his programs for building weapons of mass destruction _meta_end_dot_

 it is no accident krauthammer argued that gaddafi initiated talks with the united states via london in march _meta_number_ref_ and concluded them in december by coming clean on his nuclear weapons program just days after saddam hussein was captured _meta_end_dot_

 but as ron suskind points out in the one percent solution that s not how it really went down _meta_end_dot_

 by the mid _meta_number_ref_s gaddafi wanted legitimization an end to sanctions the ability to send libyan children to universities abroad and a rebuilding of a shattered economy that was contributing to the unrest that the dictator ruthlessly put down yet could not eliminate _meta_end_dot_

 it was made clear to him that nothing could happen until libya accepted responsibility for the pan am _meta_number_ref_ bombing and compensated the families _meta_end_dot_

 kusa was and is the head of foreign intelligence in libya _meta_end_dot_

 the first talks took place in _meta_number_ref_ when cia lifer benjamin bonk met musa kusa in geneva _meta_end_dot_

 kusa like bonk a graduate of michigan state university was and is the chief of foreign intelligence in libya _meta_end_dot_

 among other things in the consensus of every significant intelligence agency in the west kusa had planned the lockerbie attack and sent assassination teams to kill libyan dissidents in europe _meta_end_dot_

 his portfolio was broad _meta_end_dot_

 at home kusa presided over a security force that ran surveillance operations on libyans including my stepson detained citizens for years without charge or trial and routinely tortured political foes _meta_end_dot_

 techniques including cudgeling electric shock hanging by the wrists suffocation with plastic bags pouring lemon juice on open wounds as well as breaking fingers and letting them heal without medical attention _meta_end_dot_

 a month after the september _meta_number_ref_ attacks suskind writes bonk met kusa again this time in the palatial london house of prince bandar bin sultan nephew of saudi arabia s ruler then crown prince abdullah now its king _meta_end_dot_

 by this time bonk was deputy director of the cia s counter terrorist center and his mission was to obtain any and all useful intelligence about al qaeda and other islamic terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 kusa arrived with the goods an armful of dossiers _meta_end_dot_

 some of them it turned out were of libyan dissidents _meta_end_dot_

 in the mornings he met with assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs william burns to discuss compensation to the families whose kin he had helped murder in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kusa was told then october _meta_number_ref_ that libya would have to surrender any weapons of mass destruction it had _meta_end_dot_

 in the afternoon he met with bonk who told him what kusa had been waiting to hear for two years compensate the pan am _meta_number_ref_ victims and help us fight the terrorists and you re home free _meta_end_dot_

 for the next couple of years libya and the united states cooperated extensively in hunting capturing interrogating and imprisoning alleged terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 libya fingered or turned some over to the united states and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 at least four cia charter flights landed in tripoli in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ according to flight logs posted on a web site by stephen grey author of ghost plane the true story of the cia torture program _meta_end_dot_

 the cia even allowed gaddafi s intelligence officers to interrogate libyan prisoners at the guant namo detention center according to a lawyer for several detainees _meta_end_dot_

 some prisoners were shipped back to libya for incarceration there _meta_end_dot_

 in march _meta_number_ref_ gaddafi initiated talks with the british and americans dedicated to clearing up the issue of his unconventional weapons _meta_end_dot_

 a three day visit by the international atomic energy agency was allowed _meta_end_dot_

 not much was found and the iaea reported that as far as it could determine the regime was far from building any kind of nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 in october however the bbc china a libyan bound german owned ship carrying parts for centrifuges designed to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs was interdicted and its cargo revealed to the world _meta_end_dot_

 gaddafi soon invited the british and americans for a longer inspection after _meta_number_ref_ days the inspectors had uncovered a vast program that included comparatively advanced so called p _meta_number_ref_ centrifuges _meta_end_dot_

 confronted with this evidence and a compact disk of phone conversations between pakistani a q _meta_end_dot_

 khan and the man in charge of libya s clandestine program gaddafi publicly gave up his nuclear ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 and the cheney bush administration took full credit for hard nosed negotiations that had actually begun in the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 and then undersecretary of state for arms control and international security john bolton claimed that it was the administration s proliferation security initiative that was behind the bbc china s interdiction _meta_end_dot_

 but as wade boese of arms control today later challenged this interpretation as a misrepresentation _meta_end_dot_

 for the oil and gas companies the return of libya to the ranks of respectable nations has been a welcome happenstance _meta_end_dot_

 libya already contains africa s largest proven oil reserves an estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion barrels and that s with _meta_percent_ref_ of the country unexplored _meta_end_dot_

 shell chevron exxonmobil occidental petrocanada gazprom sonatrach and others have already won lucrative bids to drill for hydrocarbons _meta_end_dot_

 service companies are upgrading the battered oil infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 investors are also putting money into the tourist industry which will no doubt be assisted by the fact the libya has better preserved roman ruins than italy _meta_end_dot_

 with the revenue from these deals gaddafi is rebuilding his military _meta_end_dot_

 and presumably beefing up his security apparatus to tamp down any opposition to his continued rule _meta_end_dot_

 that opposition has been held in check by revolutionary committees whose members inhabit every neighborhood sit in every university class watch every citizen in the streets every day _meta_end_dot_

 to obtain a degree every student must pass a test on gaddafi s jumbled manifesto the green book _meta_end_dot_

 while there are no public hangings as there were when my wife taught english to libyan nuclear engineering students at al fatah university in the _meta_number_ref_s and quiet criticism can be heard among families who once cheered gaddafi s revolution any real dissent is promptly dealt with _meta_end_dot_

 for example take the case of jahmi eljahmi a political dissident who in _meta_number_ref_ was serving time for the terrible crime of calling for political pluralism in libya _meta_end_dot_

 on a visit to libya in march that year senator joe biden obtained gaddafi s consent to release eljahmi who began speaking up again _meta_end_dot_

 in an interview on the u s based arabic television station al hurrah he said i share with president bush and all of the american people human sentiments and desires for freedom democracy and propagation of democracy bush praised him _meta_end_dot_

 a month later he was arrested again and he remains incarcerated one of the political prisoners gaddafi claims he does not have _meta_end_dot_

 yet condoleeza rice could say just eight months later the truth is that the united states now has better relations with gaddafi s totalitarian regime than it ever has and there is no hint of even a nudge toward political change because the cheney bush administration has never had any intention of leading the middle east or north africa toward democracy or anything like it _meta_end_dot_

 and in the case of gaddafi as suskind has made clear the promise from the beginning was no regime change _meta_end_dot_

 in tripoli you can see where gaddafi s monopolistic grip on power has led _meta_end_dot_

 there are no soft edges _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like a run down soviet satrapy with gigantic photos of brother guide everywhere and sullen youth loitering without work _meta_end_dot_

 the best new job these days is selling cellphones _meta_end_dot_

 there is a growing religiosity paired with degeneration as unemployed young men turn to hashish and heroin and prostitution spreads _meta_end_dot_

 young men still sail the _meta_number_ref_ hours to malta by ferry to buy cartons of marlboros to resell on the streets of tripoli _meta_end_dot_

 women who had begun in the _meta_number_ref_s to give up the head coverings decreed by libyan tradition now wear hijab everywhere even on the university campus _meta_end_dot_

 and jimar the veil which was never a part of libyan dress is becoming ever more common _meta_end_dot_

 women meet in homes to study the koran and the opposition is said to be more islamist in its focus than in the past _meta_end_dot_

 for many this move toward fundamentalism reflects similar moves in other dictatorships a kind of under the surface opposition to the regime with dangerous potentialities _meta_end_dot_

 musa kusa once boasted that he knew every man with a beard in libya hinting that he knew whom to arrest if any opposition to the regime appeared _meta_end_dot_

 no more _meta_end_dot_

 beards a symbol of quiet resistance can be seen everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 at home gaddafi is no hero _meta_end_dot_

 the real test isn t how well gaddafi and his lieutenants adopt the language of the war on terror or how graciously he is received by and receives western diplomats _meta_end_dot_

 as ashur shamis writes but the desert fox seems to have no worries _meta_end_dot_

 with the new u s _meta_end_dot_

 embassy perched on the top two floors of tripoli s pricey corinthia bab hotel and libya perched atop the world s ninth largest oil reserves muammar gaddafi can count on as many years in power as he likes courtesy of oil men and realpolitikers whose alleged love for freedom and democracy is belied by their actions _meta_end_dot_

 rewarding gaddafi while his people suffer is a terrible hypocritical and dangerous example to set _meta_end_dot_
