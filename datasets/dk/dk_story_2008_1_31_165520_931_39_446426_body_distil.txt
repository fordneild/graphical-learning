  in _meta_number_ref_ richard nixon ran for president arguing that new leadership will end the war in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 a reporter turned that nearly meaningless claim into the laughable proposition that nixon had a secret plan to end the war _meta_end_dot_

 nixon was happy enough to let voters imagine that there was in fact a plan even if it was just to escalate the war and that there was a secret even if that meant secret bombings of cambodia _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has taken his cues from nixon _meta_end_dot_

 the senator from arizona one of the biggest boosters of the iraq war a distraction from capturing osama bin laden if ever there were has been telling voters for months that he has his own plan to capture bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 he ll hunt him down to the very gates of hell if need be says mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he even promises to shoot bin laden with his own hand or maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 so why hasn t mccain made his plan public or given it to the pentagon or even the current president to execute it _meta_end_question_

 alex frangos thought it was worth inquiring steve benen wonders whether mccain thinks we re children _meta_end_dot_

 reasoning may be the wrong term to describe a foreign policy pronouncement by mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he s the guy who talks of keeping american troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years and jokes about bombing iran _meta_end_dot_

 but on the other hand we shouldn t dismiss mccain s bin laden boast out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 because sometimes republicans really do have a secret plan they re just not telling you about _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain does actually have something in mind he might very well be keeping it secret because it s a bad plan _meta_end_dot_
