 bush s failures are so dizzying in scale and scope that ironically plenty of republicans still can t even make them out against the gloom shrouded horizon _meta_end_dot_

 these are like the republicans who wanted to re elect herbert hoover in _meta_number_ref_ only much dumber _meta_end_dot_

 unable in their folly to admit that bush has nearly destroyed the republican party they re actually eager for more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 and if anybody can give them four more years of such folly it is john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 eric draper ap file photo the signs are all around us that the election of mccain this year would amount to a continuation of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s reign for a further four years _meta_end_dot_

 surrounded by neocon advisers giddy at the prospect of further wars hemmed in on all sides by his stubborn support for the most disastrous policies mccain is increasingly indistinguishable from bush _meta_end_dot_

 the man even promises fellow republicans a return during the general election to that hallmark of bushism the full throated demonization of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few selections from mccain s speech at cpac last week where he sought to deflect attention from his own political weakness by lambasting democrats _meta_end_dot_

 who could have predicted it he portrays democrats as a veritable danger to the nation _meta_end_dot_

 this is indistinguishable from the rhetoric of george bush _meta_end_dot_

 after seven years of bushagoguery mccain knew his audience had been conditioned to expect red meat from a republican president _meta_end_dot_

 so he flung it at them in heaps _meta_end_dot_

 the senator from arizona is the fake moderate who declared at the _meta_number_ref_ convention that republicans should not try to use national security issues to attack democrats _meta_end_dot_

 guess what senator _meta_end_question_

 the deal is off _meta_end_dot_

 you ve learned divisiveness at the knees of the master george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 now let s see if americans are as fed up with republicans sowing discord as i suspect they are _meta_end_dot_

 a s it happens republicans themselves are increasingly horrified at the politics of divisiveness _meta_end_dot_

 oh no hah you took that the wrong way not the kind of divisions that they ve stirred up in order to turn america inside out since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no none of that _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are agitated about divisiveness within their party _meta_end_dot_

 because the personal attacks on john mccain by fellow conservatives are getting out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 that divide divide stuff is supposed to be reserved for the rest of the country not the party _meta_end_dot_

 so what if a lot of republicans don t think mccain can be trusted _meta_end_question_

 they need to learn to pipe down according to republican leaders who ve been closing ranks lately trying to shield mccain from his critics _meta_end_dot_

 it s all very reminiscent of how republicans have fought for the last two terms to shield george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush from the recriminations he so richly has earned _meta_end_dot_

 and we can expect more of the same from republican partisans if mccain is elected to carry on bush s legacy of discord for a further four years _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be placed beyond all criticism another sainted mccommander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 we couldn t ask for a better sign that a mccain presidency would represent bush redux than the sudden emergence last month of a newly diagnosed psychological disorder the mccain derangement syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 during bush s first term as their hero was piling fiasco upon fiasco humiliated right wingers advanced a daring medical theory the many criticisms leveled against the president were due not to his failures outrages and lies but rather to an otherwise undocumented mental disease the bush derangement syndrome which left critics unable and unworthy to comment on the great man _meta_end_dot_

 there was no evidence whatever to support any of the diagnoses of bds typically made at a great distance from the putative sufferers _meta_end_dot_

 but after all that s what made this medical breakthrough so daring _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not pretend to be surprised at the republicans skill set in the area of psychoses _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been successful for many years in identifying mental illnesses that they say afflict various prominent democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the entire republican party is practically a hotbed of psychiatric research _meta_end_dot_

 it s all very twisted _meta_end_dot_

 but there was a new twist several weeks ago when all of a sudden a similar disease was identified and named _meta_end_dot_

 william kristol is the wit of the weekly standard and held to be a riot in his own circles _meta_end_dot_

 even so not all conservatives are quite mollified yet by the argument that opposition to mccain signifies that they re ready for the booby hatch _meta_end_dot_

 in fact some of the mentally suspect are downright indignant to find themselves at the receiving end of republican smears _meta_end_exclamation_

 well be that as it may i m pretty sure they ll eventually embrace the idea of a mccain derangement syndrome if he should ever be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 because something gaudy and divisive would be needed to deflect attention away from the full horror of years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of bushemonium _meta_end_dot_
