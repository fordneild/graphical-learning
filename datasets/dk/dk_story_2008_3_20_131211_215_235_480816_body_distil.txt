  it s no secret that once the media latches onto a narrative they run with it the facts be damned _meta_end_dot_

 they have given us george bush the decisive leader al gore the serial liar and david petraeus the independent thinker to name just a few and they do this using innuendo well chosen adjectives or simply through the sin of omission _meta_end_dot_

 but this week cnn chose to cross the line from maintaining a narrative into the outright manipulation of the facts _meta_end_dot_

 here is how wolf blitzer chose to present john mccain repeatedly claiming that iran was training al qaeda to fight in iraq what s missing _meta_end_question_

 only the fact that mccain had made the assertion several times and that when pressed he continued to claim that it was common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran that s well known _meta_end_dot_

 and it s unfortunate what s unfortunate is that cnn is splicing videos and manipulating their audience in an effort to maintain the illusion that john mccain simply misspoke and quickly corrected himself _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has made the same baseless assertions on more than one occasion but pointing that out doesn t go along with the media narrative that only john mccain has the foreign policy expertise to answer that phone at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m so cnn fixed it _meta_end_dot_
