  where would an avowed creationist get to spout unchallenged about scientific accuracy let alone biology with any credibility _meta_end_question_

 if you re mike huckabee in america _meta_number_ref_ that would be on meet the press this weekend imprecise use of the term conception has served as the fulcrum for simplistic semantic arguments against reproductive choice for decades _meta_end_dot_

 the typical usage one encounters among anti choice proponents and religious opportunists is that life begins at conception _meta_end_dot_

 the statement is often made with complete confidence as though it s the uncontroversial scientific truth when in fact it s nothing of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 human fertilization what most right to lifers seem to define as the start of life aka conception is a state of transition between two human gametes both of which are quite alive _meta_end_dot_

 a lot has to happen before the centriole in the sperm remnant helps create a spindle where the first full set of diploid chromosomes begins to assemble _meta_end_dot_

 that s a whole nother another list of complex exquisite processes _meta_end_dot_

 where does one draw the line _meta_end_question_

 there are probably developmental scientists and medical researchers reading this and groaning at my laughable simplicity so far _meta_end_dot_

 and that s partly because they know human fertilization is a complex transient and continuous process in which most every microbial actor starts out alive and ends up dying while a tiny handful sometimes go on to produce a blastocyst _meta_end_dot_

 from start to finish only the slimmest fraction of gametes make it through fusion and implantation and even then they often fall prey to early rejection or later miscarriage _meta_end_dot_

 in simplest terms you generally start with two living things and end up with one so clearly at least one was lost along the way even under the best circumstances eh _meta_end_question_

 the fact is what usually happens during fertilization is death and destruction on the scale of a micro genocide with an occasional lone pair of improbable survivors fusing in the midst of the chaos _meta_end_dot_

 but scientifically if you want to be simple and accurate there is not a single step in early human development that goes from non life to life _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a sample of what science says _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee claims that science says anything remotely different or pro life friendlier he s either fabricating expedient stories or parroting false soundbites or possibly just imagining things _meta_end_dot_
