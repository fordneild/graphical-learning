  in typical hissy fit fashion mcconnell and the senate republicans have essentially filibustered since they forced the defeat of the leahy amendmnet to the fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 they have been objecting to requests for simple majority on various amendments and are not allowing up or down vote on these amendments _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell has moved to file for cloture meaning he wants to force a vote on cloture _meta_end_dot_

 that vote is now scheduled for monday at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the defection of rockefeller bayh mikulski pryor salazar mccaskill nelson fl carper nelson ne landrieu inouye and johnson surely emboldened mcconnell to push for cloture _meta_end_dot_

 reid has announced that he will oppose cloture _meta_end_dot_

 we need three more votes than we got on the leahy amendment today to prevent cloture and shove this back down mitch mcconnell s throat _meta_end_dot_

 if the dems can prevent cloture then the republicans have to either keep filibustering or they have to accept simple majority votes on amendments _meta_end_dot_

 we need _meta_number_ref_ votes to prevent this _meta_end_dot_

 that means flipping members of the gang that caved on the leahy amendment and or clinton and obama returning to dc for the monday vote which is very likely given that the sc primary will be over and that is the night of the state of the union _meta_end_dot_

 if the democrats can hold together on this one if they do more than just _meta_number_ref_ votes but actually hold together as a party against this massive republican abuse this bill can be derailed _meta_end_dot_

 and this is a massive republican abuse _meta_end_dot_

 every democrat who had an amendment pending and that includes diane feinstein and sheldon whitehouse need to vote with the democrats to prevent cloture on monday _meta_end_dot_

 hit the phones e mail and faxes hard until monday afternoon folks _meta_end_dot_

 we need to flip as many of these as possible _meta_end_dot_
