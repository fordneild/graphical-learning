  huckabee on his recent rise in the polls well if you want to argue that america s playa isn t human then sure giuliani s criminal expensing of his adultery to the taxpayers would in fact be a non human explanation for huckabee s rise _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not what huckabee means _meta_end_dot_

 he means that god has apparently chosen him out of the entire field of presidential candidates to be the next president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 which leads to the obviousquestion if huckabee s god has chosen him as his favored candidate will that mean that this god isn t all powerful when huckabee crashes and burns _meta_end_question_

 or like peter waldman puts it
