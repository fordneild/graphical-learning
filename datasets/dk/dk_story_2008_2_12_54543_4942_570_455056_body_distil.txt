  generally speaking when david brooks bites is every tuesday and friday but today he outdoes himself when he explains why policy unity within the democratic party is just a mirage brooks explains that everyone would be against getting out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 arab leaders yes they were first on the list would privately oppose it highly photogenic colonels would scream about betrayal and apparently all of the republicans and some independents would fight tooth and nail against leaving now that we ve turned that ever elusive corner _meta_end_dot_

 and if a president clinton or obama did manage to get their way and iraq deteroriated into violence as opposed to the nearly five years of on going violence the bloodshed would be on the new president s head but there are some people that brooks left out of his hand wringing equation and it s not just as he put it the left wing of the party it s the _meta_percent_ref_ of the american people who want us out of iraq within one to two years _meta_end_dot_

 apparently they don t count even though there s probably a photogenic colonel or two in that group _meta_end_dot_

 and a second crisis facing a democratic president would be domestic spending leaving aside the absolute idiocy of the idea that the environment education health care and the mortgage crisis is something that only dirty hippies care about one wonders if it occurred to mr _meta_end_dot_

 brooks that if we weren t spending _meta_dollor_ref_ billion per week in iraq paying for those programs would be a lot easier _meta_end_dot_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that as david brooks faces the reality that our next president will be a democrat he wants to get a head start on arguing for four more years of george bush s policies _meta_end_dot_

 because those have worked out so well br
