  this was me a lifetime ago at least in blog time _meta_end_dot_

 in actual time it was just two weeks ago the monday before super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 obama did better than that he won super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 after super tuesday i wrote people accused me of not playing the expectations game and they were right _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 the thought of closing out the month with _meta_number_ref_ point victories seemed pretty silly but that s what i thought it would take to close the deal _meta_end_dot_

 so let s see how february ended up looking post super tuesday look at those numbers _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got white states we ve got black states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got southern states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got western states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got northern states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got cheeseheads _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got primaries _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got rich states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got working class states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got blue states _meta_end_dot_

 we have red states _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got the start of a doctor seuss rhyme here you know what we don t have _meta_end_question_

 a single close contest _meta_end_dot_

 not a one _meta_end_dot_

 the rejection of hillary clinton has been absolute _meta_end_dot_

 okay obama didn t sweep with _meta_number_ref_ victories but really he did what he had to do _meta_end_dot_

 hillary only has one two victories above _meta_number_ref_ points arkansas and oklahoma _meta_end_dot_

 i m surprised he even won maine _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s campaign is now effectively dead _meta_end_dot_

 now i know people will be calling for her to quit the race but i hope she rides it out through ohio and texas _meta_end_dot_

 i think ohio needs a good dose of infrastructure building and this primary will help make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 same with texas where a solid ground operation can pave the way for some serious people powered action in the senate race with our man rick noriega _meta_end_dot_

 it would be great if this thing went to pennsylvania for the same reason but i doubt it ll get that far _meta_end_dot_

 i ll call it right now baring a major gaffe or disaster obama will win both texas and ohio and that will be that _meta_end_dot_

 in the end i don t mind the clinton campaign s negativeness _meta_end_dot_

 it really hasn t been all that bad _meta_end_dot_

 if anything the fact their attempts at negative attacks were so comically bad and easy to mock was a disappointment i would really like to see how obama and his team handle a serious attack because what we ve seen these last couple of weeks is nothing compared to what we ll see from republicans later this year _meta_end_dot_

 we as a party will easily survive the next two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 what would ve been hard to survive was the clinton campaign telling _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rds of the country that their states didn t matter but clearly it was a losing formula _meta_end_dot_

 obama s inclusive message will play much better in the general _meta_end_dot_

 so fret not and look to the benefits of keeping this thing going just a little bit longer _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got some great infrastructure building to make happen in two key states _meta_end_dot_

 and then we can turn to mccain who doesn t seem to be learning from the democratic primary that arguments over experience aren t particularly salient this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 people want change not more of the same from the crowd that gave us the current mess in d c _meta_end_dot_
