  straight talk my ass i like the concept of a non partisan or bi partisan clearinghouse for information about candidates positions on important issues _meta_end_dot_

 however i m not the biggest fan of project vote smart pvs _meta_end_dot_

 they try to get candidates to state their positions on issues in isolation when seldom do things happen in isolation _meta_end_dot_

 for instance let s say you re a member of congress and you re in favor of trimming pentagon funding and you re also in favor of increasing funding for early childhood education _meta_end_dot_

 what do you do if you ve got to vote on an omnibus bill that increases early childhood education but also increases pentagon funding while at the same time includes emergency aid for flood victims in your district _meta_end_question_

 whatever you do you re going to be accused of being a flip flopper if you expressed these positions in a pvs survey _meta_end_dot_

 what pvs has become not that they intended it i m sure is a cheap way for a candidate to provide her rival with free opposition research _meta_end_dot_

 hence more and more candidates aren t filling out their questionnaire _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the issue here isn t whether candidates should fill out the project vote smart questionnaire _meta_end_dot_

 the issue is that once again john mccain s actions show he s anything but a straight talker _meta_end_dot_

 sure he was fine with filing out their questionnaires in the past when he had token opposition for his senate seat and doing so came without any real cost _meta_end_dot_

 heck he even took a spot on project vote smart s board when the death of his predecessor in the senate barry goldwater created the opening _meta_end_dot_

 it was another way to crow about how great he was on process and transparency issues how he was really the reformer shining sunlight on a corrupt system _meta_end_dot_

 but now when it matters mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk express won t return _meta_number_ref_ phone calls and _meta_number_ref_ emails _meta_end_dot_

 and he doesn t have the candor or the guts to just come out and say i don t support project vote smart because i m not really a reformer i m just another dc republican beholden to the lobbyists and special interests and i m running to fill out george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s third term as president
