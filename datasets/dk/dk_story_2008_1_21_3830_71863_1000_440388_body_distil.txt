  on some positions a coward has asked the question is it safe _meta_end_question_

 expediency asks the question is it politic _meta_end_question_

 vanity asks the question is it popular _meta_end_question_

 but conscience asks the question is it right _meta_end_question_

 and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr november _meta_number_ref_ a few days ago coincidentally on martin luther king jr s real birthday i was at a gathering of middling size where i only knew two people _meta_end_dot_

 while i sipped my club soda and nearly nodded off listening to someone buzz on and on about football a conversation cluster within eavesdropping distance took up the subject of reservation casinos _meta_end_dot_

 i live in california and four indian gaming referenda will appear on the ballot february _meta_number_ref_ so a discussion of the topic was not a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always had an apparently inborn ability to tune into conversations across a room while blocking out those in front of me and my interest was piqued because whoever was explaining the gaming proposals seemed to know quite a bit about the behind the scenes maneuvering that led to these measures being put before the voters _meta_end_dot_

 then i heard it _meta_end_dot_

 somebody said it s the redskins revenge for the first time i looked over that way and all five people in the group were gently laughing or smiling or nodding assent _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he meant it maliciously _meta_end_dot_

 quite possibly he even thought he was being supportive _meta_end_dot_

 it s doubtful he would have said nigger or wetback or chink since there were african americans asian americans and latinos in the room _meta_end_dot_

 but no obvious indians _meta_end_dot_

 because i don t wear feathers mocassins or a loincloth and can pass for white he apparently felt unconstrained in making what i m sure he thought was a harmless little joke _meta_end_dot_

 maybe even a pro indian joke _meta_end_dot_

 i could have walked over and explained how infuriating what he had said was how hurtful it was that everybody seemed to have enjoyed what he said _meta_end_dot_

 but it gets so bloody tiring dealing with the reactions _meta_end_dot_

 not just the accusations of political correctness the rolled eyes or the aren t you being too sensitive charges inevitably delivered with a smile _meta_end_dot_

 but also the downward glances the stammering or even the apologies that so often greet an objection oh i m sorry _meta_end_dot_

 i know that you _meta_end_dot_

 uh _meta_end_dot_

 native americans object to that as if it s okay to deploy a slur when no member of the slurred ethnicity is around to be insulted _meta_end_question_

 as if racism only matters to people of color _meta_end_question_

 as if every one of us is not harmed to the core by such talk about any ethnicity and should object to it _meta_end_question_

 this incident i can recount a dozen others i ve witnessed in the _meta_number_ref_st century made me ponder a great deal the theme i ve heard so much of recently on line and off that race and racism have been transcended in america _meta_end_dot_

 that we no longer need to talk about these matters because well because talking about them only engenders bad feelings about something that is fixed except in a few backward locales by people who will be dead soon anyway _meta_end_dot_

 that _meta_number_ref_ years after the summer day reverend king made that soaring speech on the washington mall his dream is wholly achieved _meta_end_dot_

 nobody can deny that tremendous progress has been made _meta_end_dot_

 progress that is a testament both to the message of universal legal equality in the nation s founding document and two centuries of fierce and costly struggle by people of color and their white allies to transform that message into reality _meta_end_dot_

 a testament to people s willingness to change themselves to surrender their prejudices and fears to recognize injustice and do something about it even to give up their lives if that s what it takes _meta_end_dot_

 that progress cannot be sneered at _meta_end_dot_

 it reflects an america and americans of all colors at their best _meta_end_dot_

 racism nonetheless remains a chronic influence in our lives _meta_end_dot_

 yet many white people say they don t want to talk about race _meta_end_dot_

 they say they re sick of talking about it _meta_end_dot_

 that stuff is all in the past they say and wonder aloud why we can t talk about something else _meta_end_dot_

 i think what most are really saying is that they don t want to listen to talk about race _meta_end_dot_
