  one year ago today president bush announced his response to the iraq study group recommendations which centered on a gradual but significant troop withdrawal and invigorated diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 bush s response of course was an escalation of the occupying force and a renewed effort to get an oil law beneficial to u s _meta_end_dot_

 companies passed _meta_end_dot_

 in looking back at the past year of the surge earlier this week bush described it as incredibly successful beyond anybody s expectations we all remember of course what bush s stated expectation for the surge was to improve security in order to give the iraqi government the breathing space it needs to make reconciliation possible as think progress points out and as clammyc points out quelling of violence in and around baghdad resulted in eruptions of violence elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 that fact and the fact that more troops on the ground in iraq meant more targets resulted in _meta_number_ref_ the year of escalation being the the deadliest year for american troops since the war began in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ american troops died in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ days that have passed of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans have lost their lives _meta_end_dot_

 devilstower noted earlier today we are on a pace so far this year that would put us back before things improved to levels that we found intolerable pre surge and the last two days have been right up there with the worst as for the iraqis again no one is really responsible for counting _meta_end_dot_

 iraq body count reports between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ civilian deaths in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ down a bit from _meta_number_ref_ but much higher than any previous year _meta_end_dot_

 they note however that they are using incomplete sources and cannot have an accurate count _meta_end_dot_

 of course a look back on a year of splurge would be incomplete without a view from the wingnut side helpfully provided by the gop s current front running candidate and villager favorite john mccain and his faithful lapdog joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 the only two people who think keeping us in iraq for at least another _meta_number_ref_ years is a capital idea _meta_end_dot_

 rather than subjecting you to the gory details it s enough to say that they assert that the surge worked except for that part about reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 and that part about the iraqi government functioning _meta_end_dot_

 and that part about people not dying _meta_end_dot_

 it will be a tough sell for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 even among his fellow veterans and military families according to a recent la times bloomberg poll _meta_end_dot_

 among those with family members who have served in iraq or afghanistan _meta_number_ref_ percent say that the war in iraq was not worth the cost _meta_end_dot_

 nearly seven in _meta_number_ref_ military community members including active duty members veterans and their family members favor a withdrawal within the coming year or right away a view echoed in by about the same majority of the rest of the citizenry _meta_end_dot_

 and while we re talking about the citizenry last month s nyt cbs poll reiterated that the majority of americans still think that the iraq war is the most important issue facing the country _meta_end_dot_

 by the way it s the _meta_number_ref_th day since mission accomplish was declared _meta_end_dot_
