  with the iowa polls a virtual three way tie and new hampshire still within striking distance for obama and edwards with the right kind of boost iowa should once again play a huge if not determinate role in determining our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 view the latest polls and the composite poll of the polls in iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the top tier _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton the media has decreed that she s no longer inevitable and her opponents have sharpened their barbs against her _meta_end_dot_

 it s no fun being the front runner especially when your opponents decide that they want to win after all _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand she has a commanding lead in the national polls and take a look at the early state polls above she leads them all by healthy margins except for iowa _meta_end_dot_

 nevada in fact is so moving so far out of contention that it s become almost irrelevant this cycle with the other campaigns ditching the state for more fertile ground elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 yeah dean had similarly early leads but dean was volatile to put it kindly _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is not perfect but as close as you can come to it for a politician _meta_end_dot_

 she won t flame out _meta_end_dot_

 her area of weakness is that ultimately despite her big leads a majority of the democratic electorate still prefers someone else _meta_end_dot_

 in some places like iowa and nh she has a hard time getting out of the _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 if the voters were to unite around an anti hillary she d be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 and if she loses iowa and gives either obama or to a lesser degree edwards a new hampshire winning boost her house of cards could collapse _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama obama has the numbers in iowa and the numbers in his bank account to compete with hillary and he appears to be on the uptick in new hampshire after a bit of a slide _meta_end_dot_

 he still lags hillary by _meta_number_ref_ points in new hampshire but that could turn on a dime if he were to score a victory in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 he was aided quite a bit in that regard by getting his home state seiu to endorse him thus blocking their huge illinois contingent from working for the union favorite edwards _meta_end_dot_

 and his more aggressive stance is starting to score points _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand like dean in _meta_number_ref_ obama is depending on younger less experienced voters to put him over the top in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 and given that just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of iowa democrats will participate in the caucuses and that it s essentially a tied contest right now field would prove the determinate factor _meta_end_dot_

 depending on those less experienced voters didn t work out so well for dean _meta_end_dot_

 will it be any different for obama _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards edwards is in the thick of it in iowa and with local union support will make a go at it _meta_end_dot_

 the trends don t look pretty for him so he has to staunch the bleeding especially if obama picks up steam as the anti hillary _meta_end_dot_

 his decision to take public money in the primary was a tactical and strategic blunder for the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 apparently they thought the decision would score points with people upset about the role of money in politics when in reality people just want to win whether it s against the gop in november or against hillary in january and february _meta_end_dot_

 either way obama s strong fundraising is seen as a positive by many looking to take both hillary and the gop nominee out while edwards has taken a hit on electability _meta_end_dot_

 still don t count out edwards _meta_end_dot_

 his union support and latent goodwill from _meta_number_ref_ are strong in iowa and he s got huge union support in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 again a caution from _meta_number_ref_ dean had huge union support and it didn t help get him over the finish line _meta_end_dot_

 but while unions can t work miracles it s better to have them than to not _meta_end_dot_

 the second tier amazingly there is no second tier _meta_end_dot_

 the rest _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson he s hovering at the edge of relevance in iowa _meta_number_ref_ percent and new hampshire _meta_number_ref_ percent but little else to suggest that he can break through to the second tier much less the first _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd while the top candidates like to talk about leadership dodd has been giving lessons on what real leadership looks like _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice and has earned him some well deserved netroots appreciation but other than the endorsement of the influential firefighter s union instrumental in kerrey s _meta_number_ref_ primary victory it s translated into little real world support _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden dennis kucinich and mike gravel ugh _meta_end_dot_
