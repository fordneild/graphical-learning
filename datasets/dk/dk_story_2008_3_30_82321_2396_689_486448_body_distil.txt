  bad moon rising how reverend moon created the washington times seduced the religious right and built an american kingdom _meta_end_dot_

 by john gorenfeld order here i had a chance to ask john a few questions and post his newest video report king of america broken in parts _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ below on daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 john is available in comments west coast time permitting to chat with you about the cult of moon and its seemingly unending influence on the conservative movement and the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 darksyde ds given recent media interest in religious political connections or even before how does the right wing expect to get away with being so closely tied into someone as controversial as moon without greater coverage or exposure to the public _meta_end_question_

 john gorenfeld you know i would bet you that fewer than five percent of americans know that the washington times this newspaper that is constantly quoted in the conservative media sphere is published by sun myung moon _meta_end_dot_

 when i tell regular people the ones old enough to remember moon they re horrified _meta_end_dot_

 washington journalists though are another story _meta_end_dot_

 they have a tin ear for hypocrisy and working in d c they get so out of touch with reality they don t blink when moon shows up at washington times dinner parties and raves about replacing jesus christ with himself _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t bother to inform the heartland _meta_end_dot_

 there used to be plenty of washington post reports about the conservative moon alliance _meta_end_dot_

 but through sheer shamelessness the right just kept on keeping on until the media lost interest _meta_end_dot_

 now everyone i talk to at big media outlets thinks moon is a stale story even though he s as significant a figure as rupert murdoch or george soros in current american politics _meta_end_dot_

 oh it s that _meta_number_ref_s cult thing we ve covered it already but _meta_number_ref_s moon is not nearly as interesting as _meta_number_ref_s moon who is touring the planet with the president s brother neil _meta_end_dot_

 what does a cult leader have to do to get some coverage these days _meta_end_question_

 it was like pulling teeth finding a media outlet that would report his coronation on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 ds when i was a kid this guy was considered a frightening cult leader and his followers brainwashed victims in need of deprogramming _meta_end_dot_

 next thing i know he s pals with some of the most powerful and mainstream conservative leaders what happened in between _meta_end_question_

 john gorenfeld moon is the kind of horror that only richard nixon could unleash _meta_end_dot_

 to be a really great _meta_number_ref_s cult leader you had to have a mad plan but moon s vision made the rest look like amateurs _meta_end_dot_

 he had his sights on befriending the president through astroturf rallies god forgives richard nixon infiltrating congress by deploying pretty girls to warm up hill staffers and then somehow becoming the leader of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 various conservatives including a nixon aide began to see a useful ally _meta_end_dot_

 i even found a letter from a young karl rove to rnc head george bush gleefully mentioning moon s freedom leadership foundation in a list of right wing youth groups who were mobilizing to win the debate on campus _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t until _meta_number_ref_ that moon hit upon his best idea yet create the washington times _meta_end_dot_

 overnight he became the vip who published reagan s favorite newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 and since then the paper has lost _meta_dollor_ref_ billion more or less loyally pushing the conservative message into the mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 most recently its journalism has been credited by the aclu with virtually inventing the minutemen by blowing up their numbers to ridiculous proportions it has launched fabulous tales about saddam s wmds being spirited to syria by russian agents and iraqis who wanted the war to start so bad that they would commit suicide if the bombing didn t start
