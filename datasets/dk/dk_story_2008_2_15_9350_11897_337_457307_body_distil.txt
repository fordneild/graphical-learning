  josh marshall atrios the worst part about all of this is that it s turned the clinton campaign into a punchline e g _meta_end_dot_

 new mexico matters _meta_end_dot_

 for a while i was cracking up at jokes about all the things obama had transcended _meta_end_dot_

 but really it s one thing for people to get perhaps a bit over effusive about a politician and another to attempt to rewrite reality _meta_end_dot_

 shades of ari fleischer indeed _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that now you have the clinton campaign s efforts to lay the rhetorical foundation for coup by superdelegate even attempting to frame away the super delegate word by calling them automatic delegates instead as though that ll make it more palatable for the democratic base to swallow when they attempt their palace putsch _meta_end_dot_

 like josh i m not one who is too worried about the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 indeed clinton just suffered two super delegate losses in georgia including that of venerable civil rights giant john lewis _meta_end_dot_

 super delegates are committed to no one no matter what anyone says _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary suddenly turns this thing around in the next month and takes a clear pledged delegate lead over obama then she will be the nominee and john lewis and all the obama pledged delegates will vote for hillary at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 that s why counting them in the delegate tally has always been so stupid _meta_end_dot_

 so ultimately i don t think the super delegates will risk civil war inside the party by backing clinton unless they are ratifying the will of the democratic primary electorate _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise it d be ridiculous to impose a candidate rejected by the primary electorate who fares more poorly against mccain in head to head polling while raising less money than obama _meta_end_dot_

 and while i know many of you harbor dark conspiracy theories about the super delegates and moveon and dfa are doing their best to fan those flames the reality is that many of those super delegates are grassroots activists who inspired by dean s _meta_number_ref_ campaign worked hard to take over their local party machinery _meta_end_dot_

 we have lots of allies in that crowd who will do the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 and like john lewis and others have shown in the past few days many establishment super delegates will be more than happy to switch their votes to the candidate with the most popular support _meta_end_dot_

 i m truly not worried about the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 what s most interesting to me about this whole affair however is that the clintonistas would even suggest the use of super delegates to subvert the will of the democratic party electorate _meta_end_dot_

 it betrays a lack of confidence in their candidate s electoral viability even with a calendar that will become far more favorable to her in march while seemingly confirming every right wing charge that the clintons place winning above all else including principle _meta_end_dot_

 that they would even suggest a tactic that would sunder the democratic party kicking off a vicious and destructive civil war tells me that like bill in the _meta_number_ref_s when our majorities in congress and all around the country were decimated and the party s base left to wither and die hillary will put her own interests above those of their party _meta_end_dot_

 and to me there s no greater sin in democratic politics than that _meta_end_dot_

 so the clinton campaign has graduated from saying that certain states don t matter to saying certain voters don t matter to now saying that the democratic party electorate doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 to be clear it s not that i m surprised _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that i thought they d be more subtle about it _meta_end_dot_
