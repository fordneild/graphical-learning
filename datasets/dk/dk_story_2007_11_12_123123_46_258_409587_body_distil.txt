  assuming we win the presidency in _meta_number_ref_ we ll have a historic window of opportunity to enact serious progressive legislation most importantly on iraq and health care in a two year window until the _meta_number_ref_ midterms _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be ugly with a desperate gop throwing the worst they can dish to stem momentum toward universal health care and efforts to dismantle the mess they ve created these past eight years _meta_end_dot_

 we ll need all the help we can get in congress thus hopes that the favorable senate map gives us a filibuster proof majority _meta_end_dot_

 you see if you re trying to enact progressive legislation you need _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 it was a nice constitutional twist inserted in our governance by republicans and one that democrats seem quite content to allow even if republicans still only need _meta_number_ref_ votes for their own agenda _meta_end_dot_

 but for democrats to get to _meta_number_ref_ votes would require a democratic wave of epic proportions not out of the realm of possibilities but not exactly likely either _meta_end_dot_

 the chances of getting to _meta_number_ref_ by _meta_number_ref_ are much better since we have yet another favorable map that year but that doesn t help us in the two year honeymoon period we can hope to get starting in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 throw in the liebermans nelsons pryors and the like and suddenly even a _meta_number_ref_ seat democratic majority looks nothing like a _meta_number_ref_ seat progressive majority _meta_end_dot_

 but just as there are democrats who might stymie progressive legislation there are republicans who might aid it to the point where we might not have a literal _meta_number_ref_ seat majority but we could have an effective one _meta_end_dot_

 according to national journal the most liberal republican senators in _meta_number_ref_ who are still in the senate and running for reelection are the following republican senators face tough or potentially tough reelections in _meta_number_ref_ in states that will seriously consider and elect democratic senators okay some of these guys are probably hopeless like bunning who will likely retire bond and burr any republican whose name starts with the letter b really _meta_end_dot_

 but a few of the others could be peeled away from their caucus on an issue by issue basis especially as they seek to bolster their independent and moderate credentials ahead of their tough reelection battles _meta_end_dot_

 throw in olympia snowe and some of the other moderates who survive the _meta_number_ref_ elections into the mix and suddenly you have a decent sized pool of republicans who can be lobbied to abandon their caucus at least some of the time _meta_end_dot_
