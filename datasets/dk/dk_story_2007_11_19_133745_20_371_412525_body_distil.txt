  i don t know how many times i ve written this and maybe i m just wasting my time but rather than talk about leadership obama and clinton could actually shows us what that leadership looks like by fighting to prevent the senate from capitulating on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 seriously barack and hillary have the biggest soapbox in democratic politics bigger than reid or pelosi and don t use it nearly enough to help advance the national agenda _meta_end_dot_

 capitulation in the senate isn t a done deal _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are smugly sitting back assuming it ll happen _meta_end_dot_

 we re so jaded by now that we assume it ll happen _meta_end_dot_

 the very _meta_end_dot_

 smart _meta_end_dot_

 people _meta_end_dot_

 in dc completely out of touch with america think capitulation is the right thing and required for compromise which is always a one way street of course _meta_end_dot_

 but they could surprise and the chances of that happening would rise if the senate s two highest profile members actually started showing some of that leadership they keep talking about _meta_end_dot_
