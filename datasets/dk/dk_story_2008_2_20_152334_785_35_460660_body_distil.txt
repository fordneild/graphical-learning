  bill o reilly doesn t want to see michelle obama swinging from a tree _meta_end_dot_

 but you know if she forces him _meta_end_dot_

 as we know america is a completely perfect and flawless country in which nothing ever goes worng _meta_end_dot_

 and anyone who says otherwise especially if they re guilty of complaining while black is required to provide their neck size _meta_end_dot_

 o reilly doesn t really think that michelle obama needs to be dragged through town and publically hung so long as she s not militant or angry you know as long as she s not one of those uppity negros _meta_end_dot_

 apparently a radio host can sit there and seriously propose that it s legit to go on a lynching party against the wife of an african american presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to see the definition by which this is not hate speech _meta_end_dot_

 on what grounds can either fox or the radio stations that carry this execrable show justify keeping it on the air _meta_end_question_

 i don t want to see bill o reilly fired _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait _meta_end_dot_

 yes i do damn it _meta_end_dot_

 if fox doesn t toss bill o out on his ass after this stunt they should just have their anchors deliver the news wearing white hoods and be done with it _meta_end_dot_

 this is so far over the line that the line isn t even visible _meta_end_dot_
