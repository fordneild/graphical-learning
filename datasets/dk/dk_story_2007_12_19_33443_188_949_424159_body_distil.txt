  as schisms in the gop become more pronounced and erupt into a low intensity civil war a quick look at the party s factions will be useful for future scorekeeping _meta_end_dot_

 corporate cons paleocons theocons neocons and yes i know rudy and mitt are pro iraq war and that rudy has his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fetish _meta_end_dot_

 these are obviously rough generalizations _meta_end_dot_

 not every conservative fits these boxes perfectly _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case i d be willing to bet that romney and giuliani care as much about neocon fantasies as they did about traditional values before they decided to run for office _meta_end_dot_

 in other words very little _meta_end_dot_
