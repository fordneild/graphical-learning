  march numbers remember that after debts obama entered march with _meta_dollor_ref_ million that could be spent in the primary period while clinton s net cash on hand for the primary after accounting for her mounting debts was a paltry _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 the cash imbalance shows up in the campaigns spending on television advertising _meta_end_dot_

 as chuck todd pointed out yesterday last week obama outspent clinton on television _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 were clinton to finally acknowledge that she won t be the nominee step aside and let obama focus on defeating john mccain obama would be able to outspend mccain by an even larger margin than he s outspending clinton _meta_end_dot_

 early speculation has mccain raising less than _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has not been able to bring the bush fundraising network together on his behalf mccain s struggles aren t due to any failure by bush to throw his support to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the senate and congressional campaign committees where democrats are slaughtering the republicans in fundraising the rnc has a very large cash advantage over the dnc _meta_end_dot_

 bush is working to keep that advantage were he not encumbered with having to attend to clinton s futile attempt to wrest away the nomination he would be able to raise money for the dnc and use his resources not just cash but also his time against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 instead he has to continue to hold off clinton _meta_end_dot_

 why if it s mathematically implausible that she could overtake obama in the delegate count is she staying in the race _meta_end_question_

 as i ve explained before the only way she can become the nominee would be for something extraordinary to happen to obama something so awful that just about the entire democratic electorate would conclude that he had become an unsuitable nominee _meta_end_dot_

 now we have another possible explanation i m inclined to believe that clinton and her inner circle are still clinging to the increasingly fanciful hope that obama will melt down and everyone will turn to her as the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but if she continues to spend more than she raises debt could become an unwelcome factor in her decision making and one that could prolong the nomination battle and prevent us from directing our full resources against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 update at the politico ben smith reports that an obama spokesman discussing the article in time about obama s march fundraising said i don t think it s accurate _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean it isn t accurate nor does it mean that it is accurate _meta_end_dot_

 we ll apparently have to wait until tomorrow for an official statement from the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_
