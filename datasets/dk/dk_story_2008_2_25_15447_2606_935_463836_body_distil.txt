  no candidate who has any sense talks meta with reporters at least not candidly _meta_end_dot_

 speaking to reporters today on his ironically named straight talk express john mccain provided an object lesson in how he ll manage to undermine his own campaign s carefully crafted message _meta_end_dot_

 well that was clever _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain just chained himself to is called a benchmark and as far as iraq is concerned benchmarks are never met _meta_end_dot_

 if that weren t bad enough it took mccain only six seconds to reverse himself _meta_end_dot_

 that is what you might call straight doubletalk express _meta_end_dot_

 again pretty obvious that mccain is tied to the surge also known as the mccain doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 but he doesn t seem to imagine that voters might also judge him upon his doubletalk _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t appear to know whether to run on or run from iraq these days _meta_end_dot_

 if i recall correctly until recently there was direct link to this timeline john mccain on iraq on the main page of his campaign website _meta_end_dot_

 the link which boasts that mccain was right from the beginning has been moved off the front page now to an issues page _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i just noticed that the word iraq is no longer visible on the front page of mccain s website not even in the rotating statements by his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the timeline tries to convey the impression that mccain has taken a consistent position on succeeding in iraq quoting several of his calls for more troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the timeline excludes mccain s contradictory and evasive statements about how many more troops were needed as well as his excuse mongering and finger pointing last year in anticipation that the surge might fail which it did to judge by the goals bush enunciated for it _meta_end_dot_

 but the larger problem for mccain is that even if he can convince voters that he s been consistent in calling for the us to up the ante in iraq voters don t want that _meta_end_dot_

 only just over a third of americans are opposed to setting a strict timetable for withdrawal the same number who have convinced themselves that it was not a mistake to invade iraq _meta_end_dot_

 these people generally are called republicans _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that mccain is identified with maintaining the surge and plodding along in the quagmire of iraq he will get most of their votes _meta_end_dot_

 and he will lose _meta_end_dot_

 flailing about trying to spin that away will only make matters worse _meta_end_dot_
