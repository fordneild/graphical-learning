  bush s radio address this morning brought few surprises _meta_end_dot_

 and the ap stenographer somehow misses the fact that it was bush and the republicans in congress who blocked key intelligence legislation and are continuing to do so by refusing to participate in the house senate conference on the bill _meta_end_dot_

 oh those pesky facts _meta_end_dot_

 but there are still some reporters on the job exploring administration claims _meta_end_dot_

 here s wapo s dan eggen and ellen nakashima on yesterday s letter from mukasey and mcconnell on lost intelligence eggen and nakashima report in other words mukasey and mcconnell lied in their letter to congress _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_

 which leads glenn to make this point an interesting point and one our house and senate leaders should be carefully considering before they move on with this legislation _meta_end_dot_

 the attorney general of the united states our nation s chief law enforcement officer just admitted in a letter to them that the wiretapping the government has been conducting since _meta_number_ref_ is illegal _meta_end_dot_

 and they knew it _meta_end_dot_

 does congress really want to be rewarding such a brazen flouting of the law _meta_end_question_
