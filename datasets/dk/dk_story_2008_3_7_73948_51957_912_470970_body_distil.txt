  first of two parts the second part will lay out clinton s strategy for the nomination because barack obama failed to dispatch hillary clinton tuesday some in the traditional media are flipping out with talk about how this throws the nomination up in the air how things are different democrats in disarray and plenty of other idiocies _meta_end_dot_

 obama and his camp are surely deeply disappointed they didn t defeat hillary clinton in the texas or ohio primaries _meta_end_dot_

 had obama won one or both there would have been calls for clinton to step aside and let obama focus on beating john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won t step aside now and few if any party elders will ask her to between now and the pa primary on april _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_end_dot_

 however her path to the nomination isn t any easier today than it was on monday _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if you view it like a boxing match clinton had been losing round after round on points all through february _meta_end_dot_

 tuesday in terms of the entire nomination battle she didn t win as much as rally for a draw for that round _meta_end_dot_

 pundits and her campaign are touting it as a win but with a net gain of between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ delegates she made up no real ground _meta_end_dot_

 thus she lost an opportunity to narrow the gap and now very little chance of securing the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore with the certification of votes in california there appears to have been a net swing of _meta_number_ref_ delegates in favor of obama thus wiping out her already modest gains from tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 there are some scenarios that could lead to a clinton nomination i ll deal with those in the next post _meta_end_dot_

 for now here s what obama needs to do to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 remember the math _meta_end_dot_

 if obama and clinton split the remaining pledged delegates obama would only need _meta_percent_ref_ of the unpledged delegates aka superdelegates who haven t announced a preference but clinton would need _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 since super tuesday clinton has actually lost a net of one superdelegate according to the ap _meta_end_dot_

 during the same time obama added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 downplay pennsylvania and west virginia and kentucky before the potomac primary i wrote that something to watch was how the candidates did west of i _meta_number_ref_ in the mountains of western virginia and maryland sure enough on tuesday clinton romped in southern and eastern ohio _meta_end_dot_

 other than the counties of hamilton cincinnati and athens ohio university clinton won huge margins in every county that bordered kentucky west virginia or pennsylvania in scioto county she pulled in _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the results from virginia maryland and ohio demonstrate that the voters of appalachia are just not inclined to vote for obama over clinton so obama s chances of winning pennsylvania kentucky or west virginia are small _meta_end_dot_

 winning pennsylvania where it s a closed primary and governor ed rendell has a good political machine devoted to winning the state for clinton will be tough for obama _meta_end_dot_

 and winning it probably won t get rid of clinton at this point _meta_end_dot_

 his chance at the knock out blow was tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t knock her out _meta_end_dot_

 now he has to wear her down _meta_end_dot_

 rack up big margins in the states he wins of the states yet to be contested only pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky look like natural strongholds for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 obama will probably win wyoming mississippi indiana north carolina oregon montana and south dakota _meta_end_dot_

 even if clinton wins guam and puerto rico he will have added to his pledged delegate lead and there will be more stories about obama wins than clinton wins _meta_end_dot_

 but he can extend his lead even more by winning with big margins and gaining extra delegates _meta_end_dot_

 continue to raise more money than clinton it should be easy for him to maintain his fundraising advantage _meta_end_dot_

 assuming he does he will be able to outspend clinton and it will be the kind of metric that the remaining superdelegates will look at in assessing who s better to have at the top of the ticket in november _meta_end_dot_

 tighten up the surrogate operation surrogates who talk to dodgy foreign publications like the scotsman and call hillary clinton a monster or surrogates who go on television unable to cite any of obama s accomplishments may not do irreparable harm to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they don t help however and the best that can be said is that they miss opportunities to help their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 show he s tough can take a shot and deliver one one of the lasting and legitimate questions is whether obama will be able to weather the attacks of the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 he s never been challenged in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to assuage any concerns superdelegates might have about his toughness and resolve _meta_end_dot_

 he also needs to take the fight to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 she s been on the offensive for a couple weeks _meta_end_dot_

 her ability to exploit the nafta controversy certainly cost obama votes in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to now take the gloves off and take the fight to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he s doing that in mississippi using clinton s dismissal of the state against her _meta_end_dot_

 he will probably need to do that more especially by hitting at her main theme her experience _meta_end_dot_

 don t fight against michigan and florida don t get in to a fight against new contests in michigan or florida _meta_end_dot_

 clinton probably can t gain enough delegates even if she won both states to make much of a difference in the overall delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s probably not in obama s immediate self interest to have a new vote _meta_end_dot_

 however he can t be seen as working against seating the two delegations _meta_end_dot_

 therefore in objecting to seating the delegations under the proportions of their unsanctioned votes in january he should simply fall back on the dnc rules but say if both states want to have dnc approved contests he d support them _meta_end_dot_

 make clinton go through the contortions of justifying the unsanctioned votes as the basis for going against the dnc rules and seating the mi and fl delegations _meta_end_dot_

 take the high road _meta_end_dot_

 don t make any big blunders clinton s strategy at this point relies on hanging around and hoping she can force obama in to enough blunders that he explodes or the superdelegates have enough doubts that they turn to her to prevent disaster in november _meta_end_dot_

 if obama doesn t make any big blunders the odds that her strategy will work are about nil _meta_end_dot_

 that s an approach for obama to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 he would end the primary period short of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates needed to lock up the nomination but we ve known for some time that nobody would get enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination before the convention _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama holds or adds to his current delegate lead between now and the end of the primaries clinton won t have have any way to get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 any appeal to seat the mi and fl delegates would probably fail because the credentials committee will be weighted in obama s favor and chairman howard dean will be able to appoint additional people who will presumably back him up in enforcing the rules _meta_end_dot_

 she will be behind in pledged delegates obama could overtake her narrowing lead in unpledged delegates and she will be out of time _meta_end_dot_

 with no way to overtake him she will be forced to concede the nomination to obama _meta_end_dot_

 there are unknowns and he would have been much better off having dispatched clinton on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 but provided he continues what he s been doing sharpens and tightens up his campaign and his contrasts with clinton and doesn t screw up he should be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton s path to the nomination is much more difficult and i will deal with that in my next post _meta_end_dot_
