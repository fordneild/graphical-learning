  it wasn t in front of the judiciary committee but it might be a portent of things to come given leahy s interest in talking to mukasey _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he appeared at a budget hearing in the subcommittee on commerce justice science and related agencies on which leahy and feinstein sit _meta_end_dot_

 they each had more than budgets in mind _meta_end_dot_

 leahy asked mukasey about his false assertion in a recent speech that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 had received intelligence about calls from a safe house in afghanistan just prior to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but weren t able to act upon it because of fisa laws so what was mukasey talking about and how did it have anything to do with fisa _meta_end_question_

 we still don t know _meta_end_dot_

 in the letter he references there is this this explanation has come up before when the doj responded to glenn greenwald s inquiry and it failed under the scrutiny of both glenn and emptywheel _meta_end_dot_

 what that joint inquiry concluded was that while there may have been problems with intelligence agency coordination the problem was not that fisa or any other law prevented intelligence activities but that nsa chose not to follow up on this lead _meta_end_dot_

 so mukasey continues to evade the real points what has this to do with fisa and why didn t the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission have this information _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein had little more luck trying to pry an answer out of him as to whether the yet to be released yoo memo on the fourth amendment has been withdrawn because that memo has not been declassified we don t know what was the crucial aspect of that memo nor is it at all clear that the memo like the infamous torture memo has been withdrawn _meta_end_dot_

 or whether this memo provided the legal rationale for warrantless wiretapping _meta_end_dot_

 what is clear is that while he might be more adept at avoiding answering questions to senators than his predecessor he s no more inclined to tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but that s no reason to not haul his ass up to the hill on at least a weekly basis to try _meta_end_dot_

 there s no time like the present _meta_end_dot_

 senator leahy should schedule a hearing for mr _meta_end_dot_

 mukasey before the judiciary committee dedicated to just these questions _meta_end_dot_
