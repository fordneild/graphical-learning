  here are some really cool maps posted saturday that are deserving of a wider viewing _meta_end_dot_

 promoted from the diaries _meta_end_dot_

 susang since wyoming doesn t have many counties this wasn t exactly a big update _meta_end_dot_

 i did modify the coloration of california based on the certified results which were mostly better for obama so many of the counties are imperceptibly bluer though i m serious when i say imperceptibly _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that i thought was interesting was how well clinton did toward the southeastern side of wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the pattern south dakota may be a bit closer that originally expected _meta_end_dot_

 i will try to figure out the state congressional districts in north dakota so that the next update will better show the trends _meta_end_dot_

 now i do know that the contests in michigan and florida are worth _meta_number_ref_ delegates and i very much agree with the dnc s decision because of the disruptive nature of having two huge states voting early i m an iowan what can i say _meta_end_dot_

 however i do think that the trends in both states are interesting so i have included the results _meta_end_dot_

 i figure that those looking at the maps already know about the situation but if people want a version where florida and michigan are blackened to signify that no legitimate vote has occured then i will include a version with that modification in the post mississipi version _meta_end_dot_

 update i will note that the way to look at michigan is to note how dark the counties are _meta_end_dot_

 the darker they are the more people voted for uncomitted or kucinich dodd or gravel _meta_end_dot_

 many counties in tennessee are redder than any of the counties in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 also if you want bigger versions just click on the maps and go to the large size on flickr _meta_end_dot_

 on further note _meta_end_dot_

 i mentioned this in a previous diary with a previous version of this map _meta_end_dot_

 the size of these counties is proportional to their geographic size not their population or voter turnout size so there is some skew in how the red or blue some areas look _meta_end_dot_

 one thing to note is that obama does much better in urban areas _meta_end_dot_

 look at nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 there are three congressional districts that was the most detailed data i could find which theoretically have the same population but have vastly different sizes because of the population density difference between omaha and different areas of the state _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore even there a pro obama state which is overrepresented in geographic area the rural areas were more pro clinton than the urban areas _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee is another example _meta_end_dot_

 obviously clinton won that state but obviously not by as much as the map seems to indicate _meta_end_dot_

 you can actually tell where major cities are by how blue they are against the very strongly red rural regions of tennessee _meta_end_dot_
