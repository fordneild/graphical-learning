  the news out of the kentucky senate race is thoroughly uninspiring as it appears businessman bruce lunsford famous for spending vats of his own money to lose two bids for the kentucky governorship both times in the primary has decided to run for senate against minority leader mitch mcconnell lunsford is a two time loser who endorsed republican ernie fletcher for governor in _meta_number_ref_ over democrat ben chandler after losing to chandler in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 color me thrilled _meta_end_dot_

 he did endorse kentucky s democratic governor steve beshear after losing to beshear in his second race which i guess he deserves a medal for or something _meta_end_dot_

 worse luck he appears to have the support of the democratic establishment both in kentucky and in dc we have two candidates in the race already attorney and iraq war veteran andrew horne who lost in the primary in kentucky s _meta_number_ref_rd district in _meta_number_ref_ to future rep _meta_end_dot_

 john yarmuth and businessman greg fischer _meta_end_dot_

 lunsford will have to do a whole hell of a lot to convince me that he s worth supporting over either of them _meta_end_dot_

 on the bright side another congressional republican bites the dust second district rep _meta_end_dot_

 ron lewis has opted against running again to the surprise of almost everyone _meta_end_dot_

 like the jerk that he is lewis delayed his retirement announcement until the last minute so as to give his chief of staff a clear shot at the republican nomination unfortunately for them it didn t work as the nrcc anticipating lewis skulduggery managed to recruit their preferred candidate state sen _meta_end_dot_

 brett guthrie into the race at the _meta_number_ref_th hour _meta_end_dot_

 the best laid plans of mice and republicans _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile we ve got two perfectly decent candidates in the race state sen _meta_end_dot_

 david boswell and daviess county judge executive reid haire _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very republican district r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but one we re seriously contesting so hope springs eternal _meta_end_dot_
