  promoted from the diaries with minor editing smintheus the united states district court for the northern district of california held yesterday in the case of mohamed v _meta_end_dot_

 jeppesen dataplan inc _meta_end_dot_

 that the state secrets doctrine bars all suits against anyone involving allegations of covert u s _meta_end_dot_

 military or cia operations in foreign countries against foreign nationals which the government has not admitted _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the cia is free to violate your civil rights with impunity so long as it doesn t publicly admit to doing so _meta_end_dot_

 the case in question involved a private company involved in illegal rendition flights that were part of a larger cia operation to interrogate and torture terrorism suspects in this case foreign nationals _meta_end_dot_

 nationality is irrelevant however to the application of the state secrets doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 it prevents american citizens from suing anyone for conduct in connection with covert operations as well and indeed was created in a case brought by united states soldiers whose integrity was never questioned _meta_end_dot_

 the result isn t a great surprise given the outcome in the dozens of other cases in which the bush administration has asserted the state secrets privilege such as the extraordinary rendition case of el masri v _meta_end_dot_

 united states _meta_number_ref_ f _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th cir _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it is remarkable mostly because it acknowledges a point that some of the better known cases addressing the states secrets privilege have not _meta_end_dot_

 the northern district of california makes clear that the state secrets privilege amounts to absolute immunity from prosecution for every private and public party involved in a genuinely covert action _meta_end_dot_

 this contrasts strongly with the original context in which the state secrets privilege was created in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court case of united states v _meta_end_dot_

 reynolds _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ where the privilege was used to prevent the people bringing the suit from obtaining key documents necessary to prove the case from the government itself but not to prevent the suit itself from being brought based upon competent evidence such as their own testimony _meta_end_dot_

 of course a right without a remedy isn t much of a right _meta_end_dot_

 so this arcane court created privilege in fact abrogates clearly established constitutional rights of u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens and non citizens simply because the united states government has chosen to violate those rights secretly rather than publicly admitting that it is violating those rights _meta_end_dot_

 no language in the united states constitution no law enacted by congress no treaty ratified by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate and no regulation published in the federal register demands or suggests this result _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that the government can imprison and torture someone without any probable cause due process or resort to habeas corpus in violation of extradition treaties with the nations involved is a creation out of whole cloth by the justice department and the judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 it is also notable that a review of the since declassfied documents in the case that established the states secrets doctrine showed that the people barred from bringing the suit did in fact have a valid claim and that the government s lawyers lied when they claimed that state secrets were implicated in the case a deceipt for which a court asked to reopen the case held there was no remedy _meta_end_dot_

 united states _meta_number_ref_ f _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_d cir _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we also know that this administration while not the only one to invoke the state secrets privilege has done so far more aggressively than any past adminstration _meta_end_dot_

 the reporters committee for freedom of the press claims that while the government asserted the privilege approximately _meta_number_ref_ times in total between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ the government asserted it _meta_number_ref_ times in the four years after sept _meta_end_dot_
