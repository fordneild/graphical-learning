  no _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 instead what the article is selling is what schoen hopes will propel him to an even higher price range as a consultant his very own fake demographic _meta_end_dot_

 soccer moms made a media star out of _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 it depends who you ask _meta_end_dot_

 so what is it this time _meta_end_question_

 security moms _meta_end_question_

 nascar dads _meta_end_question_

 people with fake tennis ball through the window car decals that are ripoffs of fake softballs through the window but that don t make any independent sense because a tennis ball would never go through a window but who feel the need to have a decal that s relevant to their lives whether it makes sense or not _meta_end_question_

 almost _meta_end_dot_

 but dumber _meta_end_dot_

 aw how wonderfully hoary _meta_end_exclamation_

 show low arizona _meta_end_exclamation_

 why that sounds so fake it has to be real _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it must be a small town too which as we all know is the american ideal because the name is vaguely stupid sounding _meta_end_dot_

 now that s no one s fault and the people who live there aren t stupid _meta_end_dot_

 they re quite savvy i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 after all they live in a town that s so damned aw shucks sounding that they re automatically deemed down home enough to have even a hackneyed nonsensical rant enshrined by a high priced political consultant as fairly dripping with homespun genius _meta_end_dot_

 holy shit _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s it _meta_end_exclamation_

 the political holy grail _meta_end_exclamation_

 schoen has discovered self interest but named it something far more stupid _meta_end_exclamation_

 so what does schoen imagine is so important about this new group of voters motivated by self interest and an impatience with debate and or nuance _meta_end_question_

 sputter _meta_end_exclamation_

 choke _meta_end_exclamation_

 spit _meta_end_exclamation_

 the senate balked _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_exclamation_

 how dare they _meta_end_question_

 what was their concern _meta_end_question_

 the fact that the stimulus package quickly agreed upon precluded any benefits whatsoever for among others the elderly and disabled veterans _meta_end_question_

 because that s why the senate balked but of course i m sure schoen fully informed all his fake rams of the details of the situation before taking their pulse on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 so naturally we should take it as gospel that supposedly raging moderates when not clamoring for low fat milk are pissed as hell at the prospect of disabled veterans receiving a slice of the pie _meta_end_dot_

 bastards _meta_end_exclamation_

 isn t disability enough for you _meta_end_question_

 how many legs have we rams lost the use of eh _meta_end_question_

 none that s how many _meta_end_dot_

 so quit hogging all the disability _meta_end_exclamation_

 yeah i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth i m with another high priced consultant on this score mark mellman who wrote in _meta_number_ref_ ha ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 chattering classes that s just how predictable this play actually is _meta_end_dot_

 mellman even knew in _meta_number_ref_ what catch phrase schoen would use in _meta_number_ref_ to try to lend his new fake demographic some instant legitimacy _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the upshot of schoen s play besides the fact that he s hawking a book trying to sell the term ram _meta_end_question_

 well first you need to know what the rams supposedly want ooh _meta_end_dot_

 aah _meta_end_dot_

 substance not just style _meta_end_dot_

 they re tough minded pragmatists so please point them to the candidate with the solutions to winning the war on al qaeda providing affordable and accessible health care to all developing a real environmental and energy policy and reforming entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 thank you very much _meta_end_dot_

 here have a vote _meta_end_dot_

 also please point me to the magical pony that craps cotton candy _meta_end_dot_

 but if i can t have that then please give me this ah so simple _meta_end_exclamation_

 just a single promise _meta_end_exclamation_

 just _meta_end_dot_

 put it together _meta_end_exclamation_

 duh _meta_end_exclamation_

 why are you all so frickin stupid _meta_end_question_

 don t you want to revolutionize politics _meta_end_question_

 you should totally promise a genuine division of responsibility between the parties _meta_end_dot_

 like one party could be in charge of addressing global warming and the other could be in charge of denying it exists _meta_end_dot_

 one party could be in charge of boosting science education in our schools so that we can compete with the world and the other could be in charge of taking science education out of our schools so that we can compete with snake handlers _meta_end_dot_

 one party could be in charge of formulating a policy for a responsible withdrawal from iraq and the other party could be in charge of keeping us there for a hundred years _meta_end_dot_

 why didn t we think of this before _meta_end_question_

 thank you rams _meta_end_exclamation_

 thank you doug schoen _meta_end_exclamation_

 don t we look the fools _meta_end_question_

 but that s not it _meta_end_dot_

 no no _meta_end_exclamation_

 schoen has buried the nut here saving the best for last ah _meta_end_exclamation_

 ah ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 theeeeeere it is _meta_end_exclamation_

 by offering the vice presidency to joe lieberman mccain could win schoen s imaginary rams _meta_end_dot_

 now we get down to it _meta_end_dot_

 the moderate pragmatic common sense nonpartisan solution to iraq is to elect a president who says we should stay for a hundred years and start more wars along the way buuuuuuut _meta_end_dot_

 bring along a vice president who says we should stay for a hundred years and start more wars along the way _meta_end_dot_

 genius _meta_end_exclamation_

 i wish i could hold out some hope that the chattering classes when their producers agree to book schoen on tv would beat his ridiculous meme to death as all of america looks on _meta_end_dot_

 but unfortunately schoen has a suit and he will wear that suit on television _meta_end_dot_

 and probably some horn rimmed glasses too _meta_end_dot_

 and you just know how america goes weak for suits and glasses _meta_end_dot_

 so let s compromise doug schoen style _meta_end_dot_

 we will agree to recognize the deeply stupid and ossified thinking that defines schoen s politics and this is very pragmatic of us because american politics are in reality deeply stupid and ossified and television punditry will agree to laud schoen s politics as deeply insightful and visionary _meta_end_dot_

 then we will agree to meet in the middle and laud schoen s politics as deeply insightful and visionary _meta_end_question_

 sound like a deal _meta_end_question_

 i knew you d see this my way _meta_end_exclamation_

 let s get together for a beer next time i m in show low _meta_end_dot_

 update in a clear demonstration of the wild clamor for moderates marylanders yesterday unceremoniously dumped pro business democrat al wynn and anti war republican wayne gilchrest _meta_end_dot_

 wynn and gilchrest are joined by the _meta_number_ref_ eleven moderates kicked out of congress in the _meta_number_ref_ elections _meta_end_dot_

 feel the clamor _meta_end_exclamation_
