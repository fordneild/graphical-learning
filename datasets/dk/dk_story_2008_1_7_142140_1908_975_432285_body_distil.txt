  this was the question as the posted start time for the hanover stop of john mccain s the mac is back tour approached would mccain circa t minus _meta_number_ref_ outdraw biden circa t minus _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_question_

 mccain would be appearing in the dartmouth college room biden spoke in last spring but his staff had used curtains to block off maybe one third of the room for mccain and his audience and were frantically urging attendees to move toward the small stage that had been set up _meta_end_dot_

 in the end mccain did outdraw biden somewhat and one of the curtains was removed _meta_end_dot_

 but en route to that moment the mccain campaign revealed the stagecraft of campaign events more blatantly than i have ever seen revealing in the process that they wanted the crowd to be uncomfortable if it would look good for the cameras _meta_end_dot_

 so people were forced to stand in a room that could have accommodated them in chairs and harangued to crowd together long before the candidate arrived and forced to listen to some of the same godawful songs more than once due to mccain s lateness _meta_end_dot_

 one man even took a break from urging people toward the stage and tried to lead them in call and response cheers _meta_end_dot_

 who do we want for straight talk _meta_end_question_

 mccain etc he gave up pretty quickly despite the view of the mccain supporters standing next to me that being a military man he would surely be on time mccain wife cindy and the governor of vermont were nearly _meta_number_ref_ minutes later than his planned arrival time as opposed to the posted start time _meta_number_ref_ minutes before that _meta_end_dot_

 delivery of the line without a doubt mac is back fell to governor douglas who then had to encourage the crowd to applaud policy items such as middle class tax relief but found applause came easier for the hoary old straight talker line _meta_end_dot_

 cindy mccain did the feminized relational work of apologizing for their lateness and then mccain took the microphone _meta_end_dot_

 for like fifteen minutes _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s brief stump speech opened with a few lame jokes before hitting three issues _meta_end_dot_

 climate change came first mccain walks the tightrope on that touchy for republicans issue by saying that while he is convinced by the science that says climate change is real and human caused people who do not believe that should consider that the result of wrongly believing in climate change is leaving a cleaner planet for our children while the result of wrongly dismissing it is damaging their future _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to push nuclear power as a clean alternative noting that the navy has used nuclear power on ships for decades without accident and that the french also use nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 this devolves into a round of scripted france bashing leading to the question is it a straight trade _meta_end_question_

 as a republican acknowledging global warming are you required to push nuclear power and make at least three anti france jokes to atone _meta_end_question_

 next he spoke briefly about government spending aiming his pitch largely at the young people he imagined would be in the audience at a college there were a few but it was a fairly old crowd and highlighting his appearances at an mtv forum and on the daily show _meta_end_dot_

 for the older people or in the belief that college students venerate reagan _meta_end_question_

 i don t know he promised to veto every earmark presented to him using a pen given to him by saint gipper himself _meta_end_dot_

 finally the transcendental challenge of radical islam perhaps the greatest evil we ve ever faced straits of hormuz pakistan iraq afghanistan general petraeus i criticized rumsfeld surge a success _meta_end_exclamation_

 if we leave iraq al qaeda will have won and that will not happen while i am president _meta_end_exclamation_

 but if you happen to be opposed to the war yet willing to consider voting for me i understand that and will not accuse you of hating the troops one more suck up to the new hampshire primary and he turned and dashed out _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd didn t linger either _meta_end_dot_
