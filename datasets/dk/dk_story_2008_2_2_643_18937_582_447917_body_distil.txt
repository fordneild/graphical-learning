  on behalf of you the gentle reader i offered the obama and clinton campaigns the opportunity to respond to a few friendly questions on science policy right here on daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 i ve no idea if their advisers would entertain that notion _meta_end_dot_

 but if they did the first question would probably be general something like what do you consider the most pressing scientific issue facing the country and what might you do about it if elected president outside of that what questions would you like to see _meta_end_question_
