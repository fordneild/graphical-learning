  yesterday the ap reported that u s _meta_end_dot_

 district judge royce c _meta_end_dot_

 lamberth rejected white house claims that the secret service logs are private information _meta_end_dot_

 the judge then went on to describe how the records became classified in the first place emphasis mine _meta_end_dot_

 the ruling on cheney s residence could get interesting _meta_end_dot_

 they went over every single clinton visitor with a fine tooth comb and now they don t want anyone to know that falwell was visiting the white house _meta_end_question_

 why do i not buy the storyline that they are worried about the religious zealots visiting the white house _meta_end_question_

 seems to me they should be much more concerned with the jack abramoffs of the world who seemed to come and go as they pleased at least as long as the checks were coming in _meta_end_dot_

 that leads to the _meta_number_ref_nd case before the judge lamberth _meta_end_dot_

 why in the world would the secret service destroy all of their logs based on demands from the white house _meta_end_question_

 it sounds like a coordinated cover up at that point _meta_end_dot_

 especially when you consider that the secret service turned over all records to the white house from the period of jan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ just in time for abramoff s guilty plea _meta_end_dot_

 how convenient for the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 a white house spokesman said they would appeal and i expect nothing less _meta_end_dot_

 bravo to crew for keeping this case alive _meta_end_dot_
