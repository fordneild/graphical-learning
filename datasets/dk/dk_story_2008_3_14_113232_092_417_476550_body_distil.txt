  george bush s feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ executive order is quite obviously another important step in his project to dismantle the oversight of intelligence activities especially the oversight mechanisms instituted as a result of the church committee hearings in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 the executive order essentially neutered the intelligence oversight board which previously had considerable powers to expose illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 the eo has been discussed extensively on line see here and here _meta_end_dot_

 yet the traditional media has all but ignored the story until now _meta_end_dot_

 on monday for example peter baker referred to it as a little noticed executive order without however taking the trouble to describe what it actually entailed _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the only time a washington post reporter has so much as mentioned the eo _meta_end_dot_

 the near silence of the traditional media has been overwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 so today s report in the boston globe by charlie savage is welcome _meta_end_dot_

 in fact savage provides considerable background on the issues describing the most important ways in which bush s executive order hollows out the iob the historical background to the board s creation under gerald ford and the series of steps george bush has taken to undermine the intelligence oversight reforms instituted during the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 savage also provides us finally with a white house response to the charge that it has just neutralized the iob s ability to blow the whistle on illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 and the wh justification turns out to be a duesie yes indeed george bush eliminated an explicit provision under the previous eo requiring the iob to report violations of the law to the attorney general because there s nothing in the new executive order actually prohibiting the iob from blowing the whistle _meta_end_dot_

 that s really just as good isn t it _meta_end_question_
