  you could be forgiven if the last thing you remember about somalia is a scene from blackhawk down _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if the us media has devoted much attention to the story of our third simultaneous occupation _meta_end_dot_

 in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ a alliance of islamic sheiks calling for sharia law drove most of the warlords from mogadishu and the surrounding area _meta_end_dot_

 in astoundingly short order the islamic courts union was in charge of much of somalia _meta_end_dot_

 us intelligence believed that the islamic courts union was supported by al qaeda forces and was harboring known terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 they worried that somalia could become the new afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 but what to do _meta_end_question_

 after all the us army was still busy fighting the other afghanistan and that other next afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 the first move was to grab some of the displaced warlords ones who may have been involved in the attacks of us forces during the blackhawk period and provide them funding as the alliance for the restoration of peace and counter terrorism arpct _meta_end_dot_

 and the result that was to piss somalis off to the extent that the icu s popularity soared _meta_end_dot_

 the arpct got crushed and was forced to surrender _meta_end_dot_

 the icu got a congratulatory video from osama bin laden cementing the us assertion that they were al qaeda africa branch _meta_end_dot_

 the next step was to recognize the transitional federal government of somalia as the legit government of the country _meta_end_dot_

 up until then the us had ignored the tfg as meaningless but needing someone to counter the expanding icu the transitional government was suddenly propped up as vitally important _meta_end_dot_

 the tfg had to be supported _meta_end_dot_

 so long as someone else could be found to do the actual fighting _meta_end_dot_

 that someone was neighboring ethiopia _meta_end_dot_

 they had fought with somalia in the past and were none too thrilled to see the collection of squabbling warlords on their doorstep being replaced by a powerful united group that spouted a good deal of anti ethiopian rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 very quickly military supplies began to pour through ethiopia to the transitional federal government of somalia _meta_end_dot_

 bolstered by this support the tfg made some gains of its own and the last part of _meta_number_ref_ was spent in peace talks between the tfg and icu _meta_end_dot_

 the talks failed and in december the us pushed for and got a un resolution authorizing military intervention in somalia _meta_end_dot_

 the us increased weapons shipments to ethiopia and also sent in military advisors _meta_end_dot_

 by christmas the united states vs al qaeda proxy war was running hot as ethiopian and icu forces fought village to village across somalia _meta_end_dot_

 all that in less than a year _meta_end_dot_

 as _meta_number_ref_ opened the invasion of somalia was proceeding nearly as quickly as the invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 icu forces had been pushed into a small area of the country _meta_end_dot_

 ethiopian forces were pressing in and us a _meta_number_ref_ gunships and helicopters made multiple attacks on the area over a period of days _meta_end_dot_

 ostensibly us attacks were made to kill known terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally the attacks killed hundreds of icu fighters along with the populations of a couple of small villages _meta_end_dot_

 by the end of january human rights watch estimated that the ethiopian forces in somalia numbered _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the transitional government supplied another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops most of them from warlords and militias that had opposed the icu _meta_end_dot_

 the icu itself had been blown apart _meta_end_dot_

 many of the fighters who had not been killed in combined us ethiopian strikes had been captured trying to flee the country _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 victory _meta_end_exclamation_

 cue the flowers and parades _meta_end_dot_

 get out a rope it s statue topplin time _meta_end_dot_

 the prime minister of the transitional government returned to mogadishu and gave a speech demanding the surrender of terrorists wanted by the united states _meta_end_dot_

 us trained and armed ethiopian forces were in control of the countryside _meta_end_dot_

 clearly afghanistan in africa was not to be _meta_end_dot_

 except _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing is the icu had barely been seen out of mogadishu before the word insurgency started to be tossed about _meta_end_dot_

 icu stragglers and clans not part of the tfg support banded together to oppose the ethiopian invasion _meta_end_dot_

 mogadishu erupted in renewed violence and occupying forces were attacked by the now familiar trinity of roadside bombs rpg ambushes and suicide bombers _meta_end_dot_

 by march the insurgency had become organized enough to face off with units of the ethiopian army in direct combat _meta_end_dot_

 over the next month sections of mogadishu fell under control of the insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 thousands of civilians were killed as the violence exceeded even the disastrous heights of the warlords period _meta_end_dot_

 the insurgensts ethiopians and tfg by this point not always working with the ethiopians brawled through the city _meta_end_dot_

 as spring turned to summer hundreds of thousands fled the fighting _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile us warships milled around off the coast occasionally shelling areas of somalia where they still believed terrorists were holding out _meta_end_dot_

 the us backed forces searched door to door for insurgents and all too often found them waiting and ready _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the way it s continued through the summer and fall _meta_end_dot_

 more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ weary residents of mogadishu have fled as the already wounded city is torn down to its foundations _meta_end_dot_

 and in a scene all too reminiscent of the period of direct us involvement in somalia that s _meta_number_ref_ in somalia _meta_end_dot_

 in a single year the war there has covered the invasion victory proud speeches growing insurgency civilian exodus and stark tragedy of that other war _meta_end_dot_

 but on the bright side we can now study mogadishu to find out what happens next in baghdad _meta_end_dot_
