  yesterday politico s ben smith nailed rudy giuliani for nailing his mistress on the taxpayer s dime _meta_end_dot_

 and in today s washington post what kind of coverage does this major investigative piece receive _meta_end_question_

 three sentences buried in the middle of their debate coverage _meta_end_dot_

 so what is their big story of the day _meta_end_question_

 yes a front page story about rumors _meta_end_dot_

 actually calling them rumors gives them too much credence _meta_end_dot_

 it would be more accurate to call them blatant lies yet the washington post has decided to give them a national platform _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing missing from this story is the siren at the top of the page _meta_end_dot_

 but the dishonestly doesn t just rest with the people who spread these stories the washington post is just as guilty _meta_end_dot_

 they report that this is immediately followed with a line about a cbs poll that showed a huge number of voters said they did not know obama s faith what the washington post didn t bother to address _meta_end_question_

 what snopes com had to say about the story but to be fair the washington post did provide a named source who was willing to back up his claims well there you go _meta_end_dot_

 if bryan assumes something it must be newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to the washington post for their hard hitting investigative journalism _meta_end_dot_
