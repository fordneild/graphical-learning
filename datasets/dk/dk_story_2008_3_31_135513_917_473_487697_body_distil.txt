  today less than two weeks after senators chris dodd and patty murray called for bush to fire corrupt hud secretary alphonso jackson he resigned effective april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 jackson s statement tiptoes around the questions of why he s resigning _meta_end_dot_

 staying out of jail could be described as a personal matter to some i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 anyway jackson dodged questions at his announcement which has sort of been his specialty in his four turbulent years at hud _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe we should point out some of the things this bush crony from texas has avoided explaining during his tenure _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ a few weeks after being confirmed as hud secretary jackson assured a house committee that poverty is a state of mind not a condition in september _meta_number_ref_ jackson predicted that new orleans is not going to be as black as it was for a long time if ever again george bush didn t fire jackson for the callous remarks _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ jackson bragged to a real estate conference that he cancelled a contract because the contractor dared to criticize george bush _meta_end_dot_

 jackson later said that he had lied about canceling the contract _meta_end_dot_

 when the hud inspector general investigated the statement it turned out that jackson made a habit of trying to politicize hud contracts _meta_end_dot_

 bush did not fire jackson _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ hud awarded a series of contracts in which jackson had egregious conflicts of interest _meta_end_dot_

 in one case a _meta_dollor_ref_ million contract to redevelop new orleans went to a group one of whose members owed jackson hundreds of thousands of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 other large contracts went to close friends of jackson _meta_end_dot_

 the secretary also retaliated against one hud official who refused to play along _meta_end_dot_

 the hud inspector general the fbi and a federal grand jury have been investigating jackson s actions for at least half a year _meta_end_dot_

 however the white house said that bush expects that the investigation will clearly establish that he did nothing improper or unethical in september _meta_number_ref_ hud stripped tens of millions in funds from philadelphia s public housing authority evidently because it refused to hand over a _meta_dollor_ref_ million property in philly to one of jackson s friends _meta_end_dot_

 as kagro x commented when the story broke jackson encouraged to think he was unaccountable by the way bush had covered for him over the years dug in his heels _meta_end_dot_

 and so at long last when intense pressure from senators chris dodd and patty murray forced jackson out it was no surprise that bush lauded him as a great american success story which is a distinction he shares curiously with another minority cabinet member carlos gutierrez _meta_end_dot_

 as both barack obama and hillary clinton noted today jackson s sudden disappearing act comes in the midst of a great mortgage foreclosure crisis that falls most heavily upon the nation s poor _meta_end_dot_

 shame we did not fire bush earlier when we had the chance _meta_end_dot_

 progressivesouth has further thoughts on alphonso jackson s sordid past _meta_end_dot_
