  i ve been pressing that dodd button on the daily kos polls since i was practically the only one pressing it _meta_end_dot_

 but unless i hear some new words from the senator that won t happen again _meta_end_dot_

 here s an exchange from the las vegas debate _meta_end_dot_

 can you spot it in there _meta_end_question_

 the moment when i moved on from senator dodd and started searching for another candidate _meta_end_question_

 it s that point at the end the one where dodd says obviously national security let s take a quick review of the president s oath of office as specified in article ii section _meta_number_ref_ of the constitution the job of the president is to defend the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the constitution first the constitution last the constitution always _meta_end_dot_

 nowhere is the president given one inch of leeway to consider setting aside that constitution in exchange for an illusion of security _meta_end_dot_

 have presidents done so in the past _meta_end_question_

 bush has illegally _meta_end_dot_

 franklin roosevelt did illegally _meta_end_dot_

 lincoln did and even then when the unique legal entity capable of executing that constitution was at risk of complete dissolution he openly struggled with the appropriateness of that action _meta_end_dot_

 that this question should be phrased as it was only shows the casualness with which the term national security is now tossed around _meta_end_dot_

 we no longer read it as the end of the nation itself but as encompassing any threat any possible threat to any one of that nations three hundred million residents _meta_end_dot_

 that s not national security that s national fear _meta_end_dot_

 we re not facing the possible end of the nation in rebellion and riot we re not even facing about the certain knowledge of impending attack _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about setting aside the rights enshrined in the constitution against only the possibility of attack _meta_end_dot_

 if you search your dictionary i believe you will find that to be the very definition of cowardice and no one willing to make that trade deserves to utter the oath listed above _meta_end_dot_

 here s the reality _meta_end_dot_

 even if it was sure to be lost in a terrorist attack today my life is not worth the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the life of my child is not worth the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the life of hundreds thousands is not worth setting aside the rights ensured to us by the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 because setting aside the constitution is a defeat greater than any that can be delivered to us by any instrument of terror or war _meta_end_dot_

 this is something that lincoln understood quite fully _meta_end_dot_

 sitting aside the constitution is the defeat of the nation and any man or woman who doesn t understand that should not be president _meta_end_dot_

 was blitzer trying to trap dodd _meta_end_question_

 yes and unfortunately dodd went for the bait _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower several people have made good points regarding how the questions originated with discussion of rights of those outside the us and how forceful chris dodd has been in defense of the constitution on other occasions _meta_end_dot_

 so my give me liberty or jets have been cooled to some extent _meta_end_dot_

 it s still disappointing that chris dodd should so easily be steered to the guns over rights camp on any point when bill richardson who may be the worst off the cuff speaker elected to an office higher than dog catcher err no offense bill was able to come down on blitzer s ploy with a firm definitive answer _meta_end_dot_

 obama also failed to be suckered in _meta_end_dot_

 dodd on the other hand readily accepted blitzer s construction and clinton seemed practically eager to follow in that path _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower am i holding sen _meta_end_dot_

 dodd to a very high standard _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 partly that because he has been the candidate i ve been supporting for some time though i ve not said so publicly until today _meta_end_dot_

 an unreasonably high standard _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 for me this is the and has not love position _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what s being promised if it comes without rights either civil rights as defined under the constitution or the rights accorded everyone even our enemies under the law the price is too high _meta_end_dot_

 i expect chris dodd to stand up and bat down this kind of question especially when two other candidates have already dodged the trap _meta_end_dot_

 as to the argument put forward in several comments that security trumps rights is the answer you have to give to win a political election these days that elevating rights risks eight years of president rudy i d only say i m unwilling to take a my lai approach to human rights _meta_end_dot_

 i m not willing to sift the embers after the village has been burned to see if what remains is worth saving _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower and yes i ve equivocated in the title _meta_end_dot_

 i thank god am not running for any office _meta_end_dot_

 feel free to call me a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_
