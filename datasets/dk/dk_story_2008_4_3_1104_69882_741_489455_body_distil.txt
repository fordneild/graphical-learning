  eff notes h t to diarist skisb a troubling footnote in the newly released john yoo memo that s some memo title isn t it _meta_end_question_

 authority for use of military force to combat terrorist activities within the united states _meta_end_question_

 sounds important _meta_end_exclamation_

 and you say this memo concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to such operations _meta_end_question_

 the fourth amendment that bears on issues of domestic surveillance _meta_end_question_

 the uh whaddya call it _meta_end_question_

 the fisa stuff _meta_end_question_

 well that would explain the bush signing statements nullifying the multiple amendments inserted into defense department appropriations bills by rep _meta_end_dot_

 john murtha bush nullified it because his doj was telling him the fourth amendment and eo _meta_number_ref_ about which you might want to see marty lederman at balkinization doesn t apply _meta_end_dot_

 we should get that memo don t you think _meta_end_question_

 well the chairmen of the senate and house judiciary committees sen _meta_end_dot_

 pat leahy and rep _meta_end_dot_

 john conyers do _meta_end_dot_

 leahy s been after it since january _meta_number_ref_ and conyers was still asking for it as recently as february _meta_end_dot_

 but to no avail it would seem _meta_end_dot_

 yay oversight _meta_end_exclamation_

 did america know that all of this surveillance all of this recording of their phone calls and reading of their e mails was considered a military operation sure millions of our head in the sand neighbors have insisted all along that they have nothing to hide but did they know that in the minds of their government they were the targets of a military operation _meta_end_question_

 what kind of military operation is this exactly _meta_end_question_

 well the doj has since january _meta_number_ref_ asserted it s the doj position then that the aumf recognized electronic surveillance as a traditional and accepted incident of the use of military force and that that military force ought to be and is being used against _meta_end_dot_

 you _meta_end_dot_

 good thing it s just some kind of nebulous use of military force then eh _meta_end_question_

 not this other thing funny word levying only this object can t be treasonable _meta_end_dot_

 because bush and cheney were both wearing flag lapel pins when they ordered it _meta_end_dot_

 and of course because the doj says congress authorized it which makes it a consensus political decision _meta_end_dot_

 but yet _meta_end_dot_

 and you know what s interesting about that doj argument on that aumf _meta_end_question_

 yoo always carefully avoided it insisting that the aumf didn t independently authorize any powers the president didn t already have but rather merely affirmed their existence _meta_end_dot_

 in fact yoo refused even to call the aumf the aumf after all the a stands for authorization instead stubbornly insisting on referring to it only as the joint resolution but like others of yoo s memos that the doj has since had to disavow on grounds of craziness the doj has since fallen back to an only slightly less crazy insistence that the aumf authorized warrantless domestic surveillance even as the members of congress who passed it insist it did not _meta_end_dot_

 this is the gang that jay rockefeller and according to their votes on final passage of rockefeller s bill senators baucus bayh carper casey conrad inouye johnson kohl landrieu lincoln mccaskill mikulski ben nelson bill nelson pryor salazar webb and whitehouse and reps _meta_end_dot_

 boren carney cooper holden lampson and shuler wants to work with in good faith the gang that two years ago declared the nsa s domestic spying programs to have been legally authorized and yet has convinced rockefeller that congress needs to add a belt to those suspenders and retroactively immunize the telecom companies who are facilitating the spying _meta_end_dot_

 the house now says that perhaps a court should be asked whether the doj is right _meta_end_dot_

 but senator rockefeller says he s got it covered _meta_end_dot_

 no need to involve those silly courts _meta_end_dot_

 after all his bill would restore civil liberty protections through proper fisa court oversight which would be great minus the fact that it means congress is abdicating its role here if anyone believed we were going to get proper oversight from a secret court that s the doj is telling the fourth amendment doesn t apply and that federal judges are unqualified to decide on matters of national security anyway _meta_end_dot_

 every day that passes without jay rockefeller being able to cajole the weak kneed congressional democrats who still fear republican attack ads more than the prospect of gutting the constitution brings us more evidence of just how crazy the bush cheney gang really is and how agreeing to cooperate with them in good faith is crazier still _meta_end_dot_

 not seeing it at this point is just willful blindness _meta_end_dot_
