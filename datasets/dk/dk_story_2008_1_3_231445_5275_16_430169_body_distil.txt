  ezra i have to admit a bit of sentimentality _meta_end_dot_

 i loved all the speeches tonight from edwards to clintons to obama s _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud of my party _meta_end_dot_

 i m hopeful for the future _meta_end_dot_

 in a week i may get cynical again as a few lonesome democrats led by chris dodd fight another impossible battle against a terrible fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see harry reid the rest of our party s leadership and many democrats with them sell out key progressive principles out of terror that mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ will say boo they ll sell out our troops in iraq lard up on pork and forget the promises that gave them their congressional majorities in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 what do they care _meta_end_question_

 republicans are so pathetic that even an ineffective democratic party will run roughshod over them _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 the cynicism will return _meta_end_dot_

 but tonight seeing what transpired in iowa i can t help but be hopeful for our party s long term future _meta_end_dot_

 the youth vote is turning out big and turning out for us _meta_end_dot_

 independents have had enough of republicans and are trending our way _meta_end_dot_

 the center is moving leftward for the first time in a generation _meta_end_dot_

 this was never a short term project _meta_end_dot_

 it s always been a long term challenge _meta_end_dot_

 and we ll have many disappointments along the way _meta_end_dot_

 but tonight i got a glimpse of the promised land and it s a place i want to reach _meta_end_dot_
