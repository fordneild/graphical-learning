 the dncc had a blogger conference call today to update us on where things stand and at the top of that list was to remind bloggers to apply by the april _meta_number_ref_ deadline _meta_end_dot_

 as kos mentioned in today s midday open thread the dncc is providing a great perk to state bloggers they will be seated with their state delegations on the floor of the convention and not relegated to the nosebleed section _meta_end_dot_

 here are the criteria for state blogs the number of and access for the other pool of blogger credentials the national and niche type blogs has yet to be determined which is a little frustrating but to the dnc s credit they want to take care of the state bloggers first _meta_end_dot_

 the application deadline for the non state bloggers is the same april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 check the credentialing page for information on the process _meta_end_dot_

 important reminders about the state blogger credentials the dncc will start notifying blogs about their credentials in may _meta_end_dot_

 the highlight of the call was our own scout finch who previewed the project she s been up to her eyebrows in setting up the big tent new media venue or the place where all the bloggers will hang out during convention week _meta_end_dot_

 it will be in downtown denver within walking distance of the convention and will feature all of the wireless capacity and technical gizmos that bloggers probably won t be able to find in the actual convention all _meta_end_dot_

 this will include space for video and audio recording for interviews and just a place to hang out and eat and drink _meta_end_dot_

 among sponsors and partners already lined up are google and youtube with many more to come _meta_end_dot_

 this alone is going to make denver worth the trip _meta_end_dot_
