  i m dreaming of a green christmas we don t seem to have very many snowy white christmas in my neck of the woods these days _meta_end_dot_

 global warming s impact can be felt far and wide _meta_end_dot_

 the unusually balmy december weather cannot be ignored and it has me thinking more and more of a green christmas this year _meta_end_dot_

 it all started the day after halloween on a visit to the grocery store _meta_end_dot_

 i strolled through the aisles collecting my groceries when all of the sudden i heard them the jing jing jingle bells of holiday muzak _meta_end_dot_

 nooooo _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s too early _meta_end_dot_

 the halloween candy is still on the shelves _meta_end_dot_

 at that moment i felt a sudden dread in my heart _meta_end_dot_

 for the first time in my life i was dreading the holidays _meta_end_dot_

 with everything from gas to milk skyrocketing over the last few years and our wages staying stagnant the turkey isn t going to be the only lean part of our holiday this season _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after that visit to the market i received a call from my sister _meta_end_dot_

 she wanted to express her own concern about the upcoming holidays _meta_end_dot_

 because _meta_number_ref_ has effectively become known as the year of the tainted toys she wanted to discuss shopping changes for the kids this year _meta_end_dot_

 she had just finished purging the house by rounding up all the cheap plastic and abandoned toys many which take batteries scattered throughout the home _meta_end_dot_

 all told she accumulated _meta_number_ref_ full yard sized trash bags worth of goods and she was disgusted _meta_end_dot_

 it was clear we were both on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 enough was enough _meta_end_dot_

 the commercialization aspect of christmas has crested in our family _meta_end_dot_

 we began to talk about ways we might simplify and we thought back to our own childhood christmas _meta_end_dot_

 and that s when it hit me everything i wanted to know about how to tighten the belt and have an environmentally friendly christmas was right there in front of me _meta_end_dot_

 the best way for our family to move forward was to go back _meta_end_dot_

 we always thought our grandmother was a little kooky _meta_end_dot_

 having lived through the great depression as a child she and my grandfather never relinquished their frugal ways _meta_end_dot_

 i can even remember helping my grandma clean clothes in a washtub in the basement _meta_end_dot_

 i was fascinated with the ringer and eager to help _meta_end_dot_

 that was in the late _meta_number_ref_ s or early _meta_number_ref_ s long after washers and dryers were commonplace _meta_end_dot_

 during the holidays we would all roll our eyes as grandma ran around collecting all of the wrapping paper bows and ribbon _meta_end_dot_

 she would later re use every scrap _meta_end_dot_

 grandpa would sit by the fireplace with a log roller and feed newspaper into it to be re used as fire starting logs _meta_end_dot_

 we would decorate the tree not with contrived expensive plastic imported store bought ornaments but with gingerbread men christmas trees snowmen and more _meta_end_dot_

 all handmade from felt elmer s glue and whatever else we could find _meta_end_dot_

 of course the tree was complimented with strands of popcorn and construction paper chains that we tirelessly strung ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 and much of the food on the table came from the jars of fresh vegetables in the basement remnants of their enormous summer garden _meta_end_dot_

 leftover scraps were held aside for the compost bin _meta_end_dot_

 some of the gifts were handmade too _meta_end_dot_

 i recall my favorite gift from the grandparents were the matching handmade sleeping bags that all the grandkids received one year _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t so much the bag but knowing that we would be using those sleeping bags on a camping trip with grandma and grandpa _meta_end_dot_

 for many years they took each grandchild separately for several days on a camping trip _meta_end_dot_

 we loved those trips _meta_end_dot_

 catching fish with grandpa and cooking it over a fire _meta_end_dot_

 walking along the shores of a creek or small river with grandma searching for fresh watercress for our salads _meta_end_dot_

 i can t even remember what else i got for christmas in those years except for that grease album but i remember that handmade sleeping bag and the promise of adventure _meta_end_dot_

 and if i close my eyes i can almost smell that homemade pie in the oven _meta_end_dot_

 i can see grandma scampering around the homemade ornament covered tree collecting all that paper to make sure that none of it went to waste _meta_end_dot_

 what a warm feeling i get from these memories now _meta_end_dot_

 were my grandparents environmentalists ahead of their time _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it has more to do with us going astray as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 somehow we lost our collective heads in the commercial madness _meta_end_dot_

 it s now up to us to fix it _meta_end_dot_

 so this year my family is moving forward by going back _meta_end_dot_

 getting back to the basics and teaching the next generation all of the wonderful things our grandparents taught us _meta_end_dot_

 showing them that new is not always better and that a gift doesn t have to be wrapped in impenetrable plastic to have real lasting value _meta_end_dot_

 much to my own surprise it turns out that i ve been dreaming of a green christmas all along _meta_end_dot_

 as a postscript i offer this final thought on the off chance that santa does read this love letter to holidays gone by grandma would certainly agree with me that a nintendo wii is the exception to the rule and certainly falls in the category of personal enrichment _meta_end_dot_
