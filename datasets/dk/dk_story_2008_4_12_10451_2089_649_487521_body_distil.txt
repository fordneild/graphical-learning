  while obama and clinton advocates argue bitterly over which candidate has the better chance to beat republican john mccain next november citing various polls and perceived advantages it seems baffling that the discussion even need take place _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about john mccain after all a person who has so thoroughly embraced the economic blunders and foreign policy fiascos of george bush that he seems to be seeking adoption into the bush family _meta_end_dot_

 this seems to be the standard republican progression each campaign cycle each republican candidate starts out a maverick pooh poohing the religious pandering or voodoo economics of other candidates shifts towards cautious insidership and then finally must eat their past words and deeds and kowtow to those very same religious panderers and voodoo economists _meta_end_dot_

 for they are after all the soul of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 and so a ceremony is held like the one recently between a jitterbugging george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush phoning in the last shreds of his presidency with typical anti gravitas and a supplicating john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 with much pomp and bother the shared republican brain is passed from one person to the next and suddenly the new candidate can see just how brilliant all the most ridiculous positions of his party s base really are and indeed they are declared brilliant in direct proportion to how much support the candidate needs from that particular subsection of the republican machine and that is that _meta_end_dot_

 the torch of no new taxes or we must remain in iraq forever or sex is bad and scary is passed and the most inveterate positions of the party are secure in the zombie head of the new zombie candidate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s policies are on the major issues either the same or worse than bush s _meta_end_dot_

 bush is fantastically unpopular on issues of foreign policy economy and basic governance the public supports the democratic positions far more than the republican versions _meta_end_dot_

 so what the hell is going on that mccain could be even within twenty points of either clinton or obama _meta_end_question_

 who are these people that loathe everything the republicans have done the last seven years and yet would be willing to cast their votes for mccain anyway _meta_end_question_

 d epressingly i suspect the answer is straightforward and the same phenomenon of any other election and quite recognizably in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among voters especially uninformed voters simple political tribalism is a powerful force _meta_end_dot_

 as coverage about iraq wanes in favor of coverage of the campaign season the news cycles are dominated more and more by the typical entirely predictable back and forth of political gamesmanship _meta_end_dot_

 the connection between what goes on in the real world and the politics of it the people causing it to happen becomes more tenuous _meta_end_dot_

 we are very used to political campaigning every two years _meta_end_dot_

 it is rote _meta_end_dot_

 it seems an utterly fictional process in large part because it is even the most uninformed of voters is intelligent enough to know that the pandering of a political campaign is nothing more than the same general hucksterism they are exposed to in every other election _meta_end_dot_

 with few exceptions when voters hear about individual issues iraq the economy the state of healthcare the state of education they gravitate towards the democratic positions _meta_end_dot_

 but when voters simply hear about political campaigns political attacks and political statements in a vacuum the metrics for decision making revert to ingrained party loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 the decision on who to vote for becomes less associated with real world consequences even though those consequences may actually be severe and more affixed to the tribalism of the usual political faces and parties _meta_end_dot_

 this is all a very roundabout way of getting at the same tactical battle that every recent election has revolved around it s all about issues and avoiding issues _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic strategy will be to attempt to talk about real world events and real world circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 the war and the economy that s it _meta_end_dot_

 the republican strategy will be in a nutshell nuh uh _meta_end_dot_

 their goal aside from simple denial that anything is currently wrong with anything will be to make the campaign abstract and most importantly tribal forget about iraq the real problem is homosexuals _meta_end_dot_

 or flag burning _meta_end_dot_

 or immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 predictable stuff meant to evoke nationalism and fear _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_number_ref_ same crap different asshole _meta_end_dot_

 s o how could the democrats lose _meta_end_question_

 oh heavens we re talking about the democrats here _meta_end_dot_

 the ways to lose are myriad and uncountable i cannot even conceive of all the different ways democrats could invent to lose what by all logic should be a complete rout _meta_end_dot_

 a marvelous path to failure would be ceding yet freaking again foreign policy authority to an opposing party which has proven to be so spectacularly incompetent in foreign policy that we can only suspect future historians to someday discover that all planning for the iraq war was done in crayon glitter and macaroni art _meta_end_dot_

 second would be boring the american public to tears with complicated long winded proposals when the largest part of the public really only wants to know the core of those proposals is healthcare important or not _meta_end_question_

 are jobs important or not _meta_end_question_

 which party understands these things _meta_end_question_

 which party can be trusted to fix them _meta_end_question_

 the third would be legislative incompetence of their own on spending or fisa or any of the other current fiascos thus inexplicably choosing to own partial responsibility for the very blunders and failures the republicans have all so willingly embraced these past years _meta_end_dot_

 so foremost then the democratic strategy is simple it must focus on the failures of the republicans in the last seven years on every one of the central issues people currently care about _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has tied himself to bush for the love of god and country hoist him up by that very chain show people that you are not voting for a man but a mere figurehead for the usual party positions the same ones that have been chiseled from the same incompetence _meta_end_dot_

 it s about iraq stupid _meta_end_dot_

 and it s about the recession _meta_end_dot_

 yes it should be a negative campaign a very negative campaign why shouldn t it be _meta_end_question_

 the last seven years have been resoundingly profoundly catastrophically negative how is it even possible to ignore that _meta_end_question_

 how stupid would you have to be to try _meta_end_question_

 w hy am i saying all of this even though it is so obvious it is maddening to read much less write _meta_end_question_

 because deep down i entirely suspect a phalanx of democratic strategists will do their damnest to botch the thing _meta_end_dot_

 we know democrats can run campaigns against each other bitter negative campaigns campaigns that comb through every speck of dirt on a candidate s record campaigns that seek to mobilize pockets of key constituents campaigns that are simultaneously about the issues and about character _meta_end_dot_

 we know democrats can fight hard and fight smart _meta_end_dot_

 so we are going to see that in the general election too right when facing republicans who will be countering with the same playbook they have used for the past twenty years _meta_end_question_

 right _meta_end_question_
