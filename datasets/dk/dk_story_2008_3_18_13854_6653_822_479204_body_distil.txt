  in florida it was the logistics in michigan it s apparently legislative roadblocks _meta_end_dot_

 either way michigan and florida will rightly pay the price for breaking the rules _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i hope everyone agrees to seat their delegations split _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as to give no candidate an advantage for their sham contests _meta_end_dot_

 while howard dean has gotten a lot of bile thrown his way for this he has in fact shown great leadership _meta_end_dot_

 to me this was never about obama or clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it was about breaking the stranglehold that iowa and new hampshire have enjoyed at the top of the nominating calendar for far too long _meta_end_dot_

 in short if the dnc cannot enforce its rules and its calendar then there s no way in hell we ll ever keep iowa and new hampshire in check _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what calendar the dnc created iowa and new hampshire would move up their contests _meta_end_dot_

 and candidates fearful that the states would ultimately be counted would be forced to campaign in those states _meta_end_dot_

 so the message had to be sent no matter how unpopular that the dnc calendar was sacrosant and that its rules would be enforced _meta_end_dot_

 that message has now been sent _meta_end_dot_

 florida and michigan played a valued role in this battle proving they would risk their representation in order to demand a say in our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it was a gamble that didn t pay off obviously and there s great irony in the fact that a later primary would ve made them that much more influential this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 but the original sentiment still applies they risked huge in order to demand a say and that sentiment will guide big changes in our nominating calendar in the future _meta_end_dot_

 there s wide acceptance that this system is broken that the iowa new hampshire monopoly can no longer stand that the caucus system is profoundly lacking that the delegate apportioning system leaves a lot to be desired and at least in the party s rank and file that the super delegate system is less than ideal _meta_end_dot_

 each one of the challenges we ve faced this year in our path to the nomination has given us much needed impetus for future reform _meta_end_dot_

 so regardless the fact that michigan s and florida s contests will end up being non determinative to the nomination their sacrifices will ultimately help create a system that gives more americans a voice in the process _meta_end_dot_
