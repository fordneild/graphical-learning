  hillary clinton on the qualifications of john mccain to be president of the united states let us leave aside for the moment the disturbing fact that clinton is praising the presumptive republican nominee while simultaneously attacking the democrat who very well may be his opponent _meta_end_dot_

 let s examine instead the very notion of the threshold clinton presents as a qualification for president _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain served his country in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 he was captured and was kept as a prisoner of war _meta_end_dot_

 he has served on committees in the senate dealing with foreign policy and military affairs _meta_end_dot_

 in short he has decades of experience with military issues intelligence issues and other matters which one may fairly say fall within the commander in chief sphere _meta_end_dot_

 but what has been the result of these decades of experience _meta_end_question_

 what does john mccain present today that pushes him past the commander in chief threshold _meta_end_question_

 is it his joking and singing about bombing iran _meta_end_question_

 is it his promise that there will be more wars _meta_end_question_

 is it his belief that the nation s spying apparatus should be turned upon its people _meta_end_question_

 what proves that mccain has certainly crossed the threshold _meta_end_question_

 his claim that we should remain in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 his dishonest accusations that his political opponents want to wave the white flag of surrender _meta_end_question_

 or is it his insistence on sending more troops into a quagmire _meta_end_question_

 clinton s threshold appears to be more about quantity than quality _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been involved for decades in military or national security affairs and thus according to her logic he apparently crosses the threshold to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 this definition of threshold though is both troubling and dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 using this definition donald rumsfeld would certainly cross the threshold _meta_end_dot_

 colin powell would certainly cross the threshold _meta_end_dot_

 by focusing on the quantity of years in the national security arena rather than on the quality of judgment which has been evidenced during those years clinton compacts the most important role of the president into a numbers game which is blind to political philosophy or governing ideology _meta_end_dot_

 yet it is precisely the use or abuse of political philosophy and governing ideology which should be the threshold for being commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 mccain brings decades of experience to the table but he also brings a decades old us vs _meta_end_dot_

 them mentality and a loyal belief in the unitary executive _meta_end_dot_

 it is this mindset which makes clinton s assertion that mccain is certainly qualified to be commander in chief utterly absurd _meta_end_dot_

 to emphasize the absurdity of her statement let s remember that mccain s commander in chief philosophy is no different than that of president bush _meta_end_dot_

 clinton repeatedly refers to bush s legacy as a failed presidency she calls the president s decision to keep troops in iraq the height of irresponsibility and yet a man who wholeheartedly embraces both the policies of that failed presidency and the irresponsible idea of keeping troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years receives clinton s stamp of approval _meta_end_dot_

 had the founders desired years of military related experience to be a threshold for commander in chief they would have drafted such a requirement into the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 instead a _meta_number_ref_ year old natural born citizen who has resided here for _meta_number_ref_ years can assume that role _meta_end_dot_

 and the only threshold that exists is gaining the approval of the american people by proving to them that you have the judgment necessary to fulfill the duties of the office _meta_end_dot_

 it is that threshold that qualifies a person to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 it is a threshold of trust _meta_end_dot_

 a threshold of judgment _meta_end_dot_

 and against that threshold mccain s record shows that he falls far short _meta_end_dot_
