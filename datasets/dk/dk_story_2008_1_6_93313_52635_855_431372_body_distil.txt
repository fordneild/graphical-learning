  just when you thought george bush had exhausted every conceivable trick to thwart the will of congress he invents another novelty stunt _meta_end_dot_

 in this case bush re installed his controversial head of mine safety only three days after the man s recess appointment had lapsed forcing him to give up the office he d clung to for more than a year _meta_end_dot_

 this episode perfectly encapsulates the president s passion for putting industry insiders in charge of regulatory agencies _meta_end_dot_

 what an absurd tale this is _meta_end_dot_

 in september _meta_number_ref_ bush nominated richard stickler a former executive at beth energy to head up the mine safety and health administration _meta_end_dot_

 the company had had a reasonably lousy safety record under stickler _meta_end_dot_

 his nomination opposed by the united mine workers and afl cio went nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the senate decided it couldn t tolerate an industry hack in that job and rejected stickler s nomination once and then a second time when bush re nominated him _meta_end_dot_

 so taking the low road as you might expect in october _meta_number_ref_ bush installed stickler as head of msha by means of a recess appointment _meta_end_dot_

 in november _meta_number_ref_ and again in january _meta_number_ref_ bush re nominated stickler for the permanent position but to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 if anything stickler demonstrated poor judgment and weak leadership in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ during the disastrous crandall canyon mine rescue operation _meta_end_dot_

 last monday december _meta_number_ref_st stickler s appointment finally expired under the federal law governing the duration of recess appointments _meta_end_dot_

 his bio page at msha came down and he appeared to be out of a job _meta_end_dot_

 but the administration remained silent about who was now in charge _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday of this week msha revealed that stickler had been replaced by an agency staffer john pallasch who took over as acting assistant secretary for mine safety and health _meta_end_dot_

 and then on friday the very next day george bush announced that he intends to designate stickler to take over his old job but this time as acting assistant secretary for mine safety and health _meta_end_dot_

 although his recess appointment couldn t be renewed a simple change of job title may allow stickler to hang on until i suppose the very gates of hell gape open _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration position at the moment is that stickler may serve until bush leaves office _meta_end_dot_

 senator kennedy chairman of the senate health education labor and pensions committee has issued a statement deploring the way the wh has again gone behind the senate s back to install mr _meta_end_dot_

 stickler _meta_end_dot_

 the gazette mail adds this if anything that s putting it too mildly _meta_end_dot_
