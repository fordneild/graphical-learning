  last week michael mukasey was on a fear tour during congressional recess and gave a much publicized and tearful speech that seemed to boil down to we owe it to the people who died on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to give the telecoms who spied on you retroactive amnesty he also dropped a bit of a bombshell in that speech that greenwald picked up on immediately _meta_end_dot_

 here s the full mukasey quote setting aside the outright lie mukasey tells that a warrant would have been required for that target outside the united states there s the startling new revelation as glenn says about this pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ intelligence failure that as of yet has gone unreported _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t included in testimony before the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission _meta_end_dot_

 glenn olbermann has picked up on the story questioning whether mukasey is confused about details and making this story up out of whole cloth or whether this is yet more indication of the incompetence of the bush administration or whether it is actual willful negligence on the part of the administration _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to lean toward incompetence but i wholeheartedly agree with olbermann and greenwald and others who have called attention to this assertion by mukasey that congress needs to get his ass in a chair before a committee or two to testify about this _meta_end_dot_

 and that should happen before any legislation regarding intelligence particularly fisa is acted upon _meta_end_dot_

 as a bit of an aside let s go back to what was happening prior to the attacks on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ presumably when the intelligence community was somehow grappling with a phone call that most certainly could have been legally monitored from afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 we know bush was in crawford and we know that s where he received the infamous august _meta_number_ref_ pdb bin laden determined to strike in the u s the pdb that was ignored _meta_end_dot_

 but what else was the administration grappling with that summer _meta_end_question_

 here s one small thing that we now know was occupying the administration thanks to eric lichblau s newly released book bush s law _meta_end_dot_

 that s what at least part of our government was focused on security and logistics for jenna bush and her friends on a drinking binge _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us back to both incompetence and negligence _meta_end_dot_

 note eric lichtblau will be liveblogging about his new book here on sunday at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 edt _meta_end_dot_
