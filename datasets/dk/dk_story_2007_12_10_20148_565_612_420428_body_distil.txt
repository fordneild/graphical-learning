  those are the fevered imaginings of jim risch gop candidate for larry craig s senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 the fundraising letter pdf really lays bare all of the gop s worst fears bad grammar typos _meta_number_ref_s styling does anyone use courier and cheesie faux felt tipped notations for emphasis anymore and all _meta_end_dot_

 this is pure republicanism in all its anachronistic glory attempting to feed on the fear of republicans that the seat that apparently is the private property of republicans will be stolen from them by democrats that evil leaders who hate america are lurking out there that the brown people will get amnesty that women will continue to have the right to control their own destiny and that they re gonna take your gun away _meta_end_dot_

 fear apparently means not hiring a proof reader _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to read it to believe it risch perfectly exemplifies just how stuck in the past at the republican party is _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t a huge surprise coming from the guy who proudly proclaimed his luddite proclivities who sometimes reads the printouts of online news that his staff provide _meta_end_dot_

 what s sad about this is that the republican base will fall for it hook line and sinker considering how stuck they are in the reagan administration era _meta_end_dot_

 but it also shows the unease idaho republicans feel knowing that the mantle they have to carry is that of george bush and even worse larry craig _meta_end_dot_

 it also tells a truth about jim risch that is definitely his biggest flaw as a candidate as long time idaho political reporter turned blogger randy stapilus notes this race could be a big money deal even if my own greatest wish of larry craig deciding to defend his seat doesn t come to fruition _meta_end_dot_

 despite risch s fear mongering the national democrats haven t decided to spend millions in idaho but they could _meta_end_dot_

 democrat larry larocco in contrast to risch knows how to run a high profile campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he knows how to raise money and will do the hard work necessary on a campaign something risch has always been loathe to do _meta_end_dot_

 in looking forward in embracing the _meta_number_ref_st century and new technology including the netroots larocco provides a sharp contrast _meta_end_dot_

 in a climate of voters screaming for change that s exactly what he needs to do _meta_end_dot_

 idaho blogger mountaingoat provides a nice take on those contrasts between larocco and risch _meta_end_dot_

 and kossack serephin provides an hilarious interpretation of the risch letter at his idaho place _meta_end_dot_

 also larocco is planning a chat session here on wednesday at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mountain time so stop by and ask him what s happening in the campaign _meta_end_dot_
