  on friday afternoon the white house posted without fanfare a new executive order that revamps an important though little known intelligence board _meta_end_dot_

 there are a few minor changes but the most radical revision appears to be that the board has now been stripped of nearly all its powers to investigate and check illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 it s difficult to see what legitimate reasons there could have been for gutting the oversight activities of the board in this way and the wh has not explained the changes _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps not coincidentally the board has been renamed _meta_end_dot_

 under the older executive order from _meta_number_ref_ it was called the president s foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab _meta_end_dot_

 now it has been renamed the president s intelligence advisory board piab suggesting perhaps that the bush administration had domestic intelligence activities in mind while making these revisions _meta_end_dot_

 pfiab is tasked with a range of things but particularly with assessing the quality quantity and adequacy of intelligence collection of analysis and estimates and of counterintelligence and other intelligence activities and with reviewing the performance of intelligence agencies _meta_end_dot_

 board members are meant to bring an independent point of view to bear on intelligence activities they cannot be employees of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 this excellent post from _meta_number_ref_ by georgia_meta_number_ref_ has essential background on the board _meta_end_dot_

 georgia also highlighted how over the course of his presidency bush had stacked the pfiab increasingly with cronies and utter hacks many of whom were in no way capable of assessing intelligence activities or reviewing agencies _meta_end_dot_

 in other words bush clearly had little interest in using the board as intended to serve as an independent check upon the country s intelligence services _meta_end_dot_

 and now bush has remade pfiab piab in such a way as to take away the very means the board used to possess to check out of control intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 there is a powerful and critical standing committee within pfiab the intelligence oversight board iob _meta_end_dot_

 it was created in _meta_number_ref_ after the exposure of widespread intelligence abuses _meta_end_dot_

 iob s purpose was to act as a check upon illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 the most radical changes in the new executive order concern the iob which bush has stripped of important powers and duties _meta_end_dot_

 here from the _meta_number_ref_ executive order are the relevant powers and duties of the iob which were in effect until friday _meta_end_dot_

 i have put in bold several notable clauses _meta_end_dot_

 now compare the iob s powers and duties under bush s new executive order _meta_end_dot_

 you ll note that nearly all the foregoing powers and duties are gone and with them any real chance of independence of action _meta_end_dot_

 the newly revised iob is much more passive _meta_end_dot_

 gone is the duty to review agency guidelines regarding illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 gone is the duty to hold accountable the intelligence watchdog offices such as inspectors general who are supposed to serve as a bulwark against illegal activities _meta_end_dot_

 gone is the duty shall forward to take illegal activities directly to the attorney general _meta_end_dot_

 that was a core function of the iob originally _meta_end_dot_

 as before the iob can still report any illegality to the president who may however have had a hand in the law breaking _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the iob is discouraged from doing even that much if the lawlessness already seems to be getting addressed by some agency head or the dni _meta_end_dot_

 the new rules seem to envisage at least in some cases that illegal activities identified by iob can be remedied with bureaucratic fixes without notifying the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 gone too for the most part are independent investigations _meta_end_dot_

 what s left is mainly the duty to review and respond to the reports sent back to iob by the dni who now acts as an intermediary for any complaints that iob may make about illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 iob s recommendations have to be laundered through the dni henceforth _meta_end_dot_

 as described in section _meta_number_ref_ of the new executive order the dni may act upon iob s recommendations to correct illegal activities or even report the activities to the attorney general as appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 but the iob is essentially dependent upon the dni _meta_end_dot_

 it cannot effect any change or expose any crimes against the wishes of the dni or president _meta_end_dot_

 as the ap report emphasizes bush s executive order transfers many of iob s former powers and responsibilities directly to the dni _meta_end_dot_

 in short the iob has been hollowed out and lost any real ability to act independently to uncover thwart expose or punish illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 t o return then to the name change _meta_end_dot_

 it could be that the hollowing out of the iob s powers is related to the fact that the pfiab now piab has lost the term foreign in its name _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration is engaged in an epic struggle with congress to keep its illegal domestic intelligence activities secret _meta_end_dot_

 that is what the battle over the fisa bill is all about _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing bush cheney and addington would wish to do would be to leave the iob in a position to start investigating or exposing that illegality now or in a future administration _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting that an anonymous wh official has offered to the associated press a preposterous explanation for the new executive order _meta_end_dot_

 it is the official claims all about forcing the intelligence agencies to work with dni mike mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 and how does that explain the stripping away of iob s duty to report illegal activities directly to the attorney general _meta_end_question_

 no the wh spin is meant to distract from rather than explain that very fact _meta_end_dot_

 this is yet another major intelligence reform of the post nixon era that the bush administration has undermined _meta_end_dot_
