 we ve been subjected to weeks of being told that the future of our economy of capitalism of the very american way of life itself is at risk during this shopping season _meta_end_dot_

 so what are euphoric but terror alerted maryland patriots supposed to do _meta_end_question_

 stay home and wet the bed _meta_end_question_

 or venture to the mall facing down lone wolfs in order to load crappy lead laced toys onto credit cards and congratulate themselves on a display of courage equal to patrick henry _meta_end_question_

 or perhaps we re supposed to be terrorized into shopping online _meta_end_question_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_
