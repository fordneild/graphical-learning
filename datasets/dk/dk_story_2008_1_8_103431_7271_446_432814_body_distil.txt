  between asking questions about what candidates would do on the morning after an atomic bomb had left a mushroom cloud hanging over an american city millions dead and children running through the streets with their hair on fire charlie gibson took time to play praise the surge _meta_end_dot_

 charlie most certainly was not there to debate because he ignored any interruption by the candidates on the stage to continue his surge song _meta_end_dot_

 in fact gibson sings the chorus louder than the bush administration which is at least willing to admit that political progress which was the purpose of the surge has not occurred _meta_end_dot_

 so charlie this is for you _meta_end_dot_

 wait a second if dropping another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops into the pot didn t result in reducing violence back to the same levels we found intolerable before the surge when what was _meta_end_question_

 outside of iraq these deals have a different name _meta_end_dot_

 two actually _meta_end_dot_

 you could call it bribery _meta_end_dot_

 or you could call it blackmail _meta_end_dot_

 but in any case after seeing the disaster caused by the surge petraeus implemented another strategy that no one in washington seems that eager to praise paying off our enemies _meta_end_dot_

 there have been two results from this _meta_end_dot_

 complete segregation of iraq into warring factions _meta_end_dot_

 and we ve provided space not to the politicians but to the militias who are preparing to start the next civil war the bigger civil war the civil war that will be fought with the dollars and training and weapons we have provided _meta_end_dot_

 how can you be sure that the bribery was what made the change not the escalation _meta_end_question_

 you have only to look at what happened in the surge before the dollars started to flow _meta_end_dot_

 so next time charlie how about asking the republican candidates how they think wide scale bribery is working as a strategy in iraq _meta_end_question_
