  while most star gazers were occupied with the lunar eclipse a wayward surveillance satellite was safely taken out by a us missile this week there s certainly room for disagreement on this _meta_end_dot_

 but one school of thought i m partial to is that future developments from this kind of technology might lead to methods to destroy incoming nuclear warheads and maybe one day to divert comets or asteroids away from the earth and or to interplanetary construction projects _meta_end_dot_

 these are capabilities we arguably need to have at some point not just as a nation but as a species _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think _meta_end_question_
