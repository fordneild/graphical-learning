  so yesterday emily litella a combination of sixteen intelligence agencies delivered their assessment of iran _meta_end_dot_

 not everyone was so wrong about iran _meta_end_dot_

 there was one leader who warned that we had no evidence that iran was pursuing nuclear weapons and that running around like a madman with a blade in one s hand is not the best way to solve such problems unfortunately that was vladimir putin _meta_end_dot_

 if george and dick and condi have been grumbling about serious action in iraq the republican candidates haven t been much better _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain of course delivered his thoughts in song _meta_end_dot_

 willard romney scoffed at the idea of talking when guns were available _meta_end_dot_

 of course romney did suggest that instead of talking to the iranian government we instead talk to the religious leadership er _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 rudy was also quick to put his finger on the trigger _meta_end_dot_

 the media s new darling mike huckabee suggested a more peaceful approach _meta_end_dot_

 see with the huckabee option we only further cripple iran s economy and if we end up bombing them it will be their fault _meta_end_dot_

 what will be fun this week will be tracking how the republicans play iran in light of the air having been let out of their nuclear balloon _meta_end_dot_

 don t expect a lot of change _meta_end_dot_

 republicans need their bogyman to keep the proper level of fear in their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 besides not having weapons never meant we couldn t invade anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the iranians only have to look across the border to see that _meta_end_dot_

 there have been numerous diaries on the nie including one by granny doc that got a lot of well deserved attention
