  you thought the nevada caucuses happened in january _meta_end_question_

 they did _meta_end_dot_

 but today the second stage of the nevada caucuses took place _meta_end_dot_

 or is still taking place _meta_end_dot_

 or is just colossally fubar _meta_end_dot_

 this is what was supposed to happen this is what is happening apparently one of the problems is that the room where they were caucuses in las vegas could only hold _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people there were over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people and they weren t able to circulate people through the room and get everyone in from the line outside _meta_end_dot_

 it s great that turnout is so terrific in the primaries and caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 it s also no surprise _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds as if the nv democratic party got caught unprepared for the surge in turnout which in light of the repeated huge surge in participation seems inexcusable _meta_end_dot_

 update some folks are asking why the turnout was unexpected since the delegates should all have been determined in the first round _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this is the first time the second round occurred when the nomination hadn t been determined _meta_end_dot_

 in earlier contests most of the delegates didn t bother coming to the second round _meta_end_dot_

 but this time with the delegate count so close there was an obvious reason for them to show up _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it looks like the campaigns recruited people to be alternates for delegates who didn t show up and some of these alternates may have gotten in before the delegates who should have gotten in to the room _meta_end_dot_

 just a colossal screwup _meta_end_dot_
