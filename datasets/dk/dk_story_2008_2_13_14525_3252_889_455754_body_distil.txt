  promoted from the diaries by mb don t let anyone fool you into believing that john mccain is some sort of pied piper who s gained the unquestioning allegiance of the military and veterans communities _meta_end_dot_

 i know that s how they like to portray it on the cable news shows but it s just not true _meta_end_dot_

 i also realize lots of republicans have a vested interest in seeing john mccain cast as the patron saint of militaria but the numbers just aren t there _meta_end_dot_

 sorry _meta_end_dot_
