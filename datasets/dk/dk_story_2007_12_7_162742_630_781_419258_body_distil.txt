  today congressional democrats called for an investigation of the _meta_number_ref_ cia cover up in which at least two videotapes were deliberately destroyed in order to protect cia agents from possible repercussions for their acts _meta_end_dot_

 the tapes were official records of interrogations of terrorist suspects in which enhanced techniques a bush administration euphemism for torture were employed by cia agents _meta_end_dot_

 these tapes had been kept from jose padilla s lawyers who sought them to defend their client against allegations made by one of the men whom the cia interrogated abu zubaydah _meta_end_dot_

 the tapes were also withheld from the federal court in which zacarias moussaoui was tried _meta_end_dot_

 in both _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ in fact the cia told the prosecutors that the cia did not possess the tapes the court had requested _meta_end_dot_

 the tapes were kept from the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission which requested all records of interrogations of terrorist suspects _meta_end_dot_

 the commission eventually relied heavily on statements made under duress by zubaydah and another subject of a videotaped interrogation ramzi binalshibh _meta_end_dot_

 mark mazzetti reports on the anger in congress at the revelation that the long sought tapes were secretly destroyed by porter goss cia in _meta_number_ref_ the top democrat and republican on the house intelligence committee in _meta_number_ref_ have also indicated that they were kept in the dark _meta_end_dot_

 a spokesman for rep _meta_end_dot_

 pete hoekstra then chairman of the committee states that he was never briefed or advised that these tapes existed or that they were going to be destroyed rep _meta_end_dot_

 jane harman has also declared that she was not informed by the bush administration of the existence of the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 how many times have bush administration officials declared that they briefed members of congress on secret and deplorable programs only to be contradicted by both democratic and republican members _meta_end_question_

 i m just asking because i m quickly losing count _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact sen _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller chairman of the select committee on intelligence released a statement today that appears to indicate that the committee was briefed on the tapes only after they d been destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 more here from the associated press on reactions to the cia cover up _meta_end_dot_

 t his is a huge scandal so great that the cia director michael hayden decided to spin it as soon as the new york times informed him late on wednesday that it was about to publish on friday mark mazzetti s report on the videotapes destruction _meta_end_dot_

 so on thursday as brian ross reported yesterday the cia jumped in to disburden itself of the information on it s own terms _meta_end_dot_

 the cia s own terms you won t be surprised to learn are that there s nothing remotely objectionable or even remarkable in what it did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 here is hayden s statement which neglects entirely to mention that the destroyed tapes had been sought by multiple parties over the years _meta_end_dot_

 the first paragraph reads democrats on the intelligence committees in the house and senate seem to think the final two sentences quoted are false _meta_end_dot_

 how much of the rest of hayden s statement is false may have to be determined _meta_end_dot_

 the statement as a whole is rather incredible _meta_end_dot_

 consider for example this removing any need for tapes _meta_end_question_

 i suppose we are to imagine then that if the cia had really and truly removed any need for tapes then they might just as well remove the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 it s notoriously easy to spirit highly sensitive videotapes out of langley evidently though not any of the other millions of documents stored there that might tend if treated carelessly to reveal the identity of one or more cia agents _meta_end_dot_

 you have to wonder whether the concern within the cia over the continued existence of these tapes had anything at all to do with potential prosecution for torturing prisoners during those interrogations waterboarding or enhanced drowning _meta_end_dot_

 but nope the real concern was that terrorists might take it into their heads to terrorize cia agents _meta_end_dot_

 that would be this office of general counsel pdf _meta_end_dot_

 we also learn from hayden s memo that critics of the cia are irksome or just possibly we may see investigations and prosecutions for obstruction of justice _meta_end_dot_

 a final note _meta_end_dot_

 we have known for a long time about the one time existence of these tapes at least three in number _meta_end_dot_

 as barb points out to me dana perino would have us believe that george bush by contrast knows nothing _meta_end_dot_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 updated the politico has a copy of a new letter from reyes and hoekstra to hayden calling him out on false statements he made in his message to cia employees _meta_end_dot_

 here it is in part that conforms to what sen _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller said about the experience of the intelligence committee in the other chamber _meta_end_dot_

 several commenters on this thread believe that there is a basic contradiction in what members of congress are arguing _meta_end_dot_

 i m not so sure that is true _meta_end_dot_

 the point made by harman rockefeller et alii is that the cia and the administration did not brief them about the tapes until after the cia had destroyed the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 there were of course many reports of such tapes existing _meta_end_dot_

 that is why for example the judge who was trying the case of zacarias moussaoui asked the federal government to hand the tapes over and why lawyers for padilla also asked for them _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to see unconfirmed reports about the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite another to receive a briefing about them by the cia _meta_end_dot_

 michael hayden in his message to cia employees stated the leaders of our oversight committees in congress were informed of the videos years ago and of the agency s intention to dispose of the material that appears to be false if you believe the members of congress who state that they were briefed only recently and after the tapes had been destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 m eanwhile valtin points out that videotapes of jose padilla s interrogation in charleston s c _meta_end_dot_

 went missing _meta_end_dot_

 a lso two other commenters make interesting points _meta_end_dot_

 first lysias reminds us that according to ron suskind who has cia sources abu zubaydah was tortured on bush s orders over cia protests this is related to the comment by alyoshakaramazov who argues that in the past bush has taken a different route when scandals pop up typically bush claims that he was never informed _meta_end_dot_

 here perino has bush claiming that he has no memory _meta_end_dot_

 together these two things perhaps suggest that bush knows all too well that he may be tied either to ordering the interrogation s or to direct knowledge of the tapes perhaps having viewed them _meta_end_dot_
