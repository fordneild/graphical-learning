  lieberman s spokesman dan gerstein on his campaign being busted for lying about their website crash in the _meta_number_ref_ primary legally the matter was closed before the _meta_number_ref_ general election in october of that year and they didn t see fit to admit to the public that they had smeared the ned lamont campaign and bloggers like us _meta_end_dot_

 that would require integrity the likes not seen around joe lieberman since _meta_end_dot_

 well perhaps ever _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t rocket science _meta_end_dot_

 the lieberman campaign was incompetent in its web dealings as was painfully obvious the very day his site went down _meta_end_dot_

 yet that didn t stop gerstein and lieberman from blaming their incompetence on others and it didn t stop the traditional media from trumpeting those lies and smears none of which bothered to ask their tech teams or outside tech sources to take a look and see if the lieberman charges held any water _meta_end_dot_

 it also didn t stop connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal and us attorney kevin o connor from refusing to release details of lieberman s bogus charges and his campaign s rank incompetence a week before the election lest it hurt their friend s re election chances _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure karl rove and monica goodling were mighty pleased with o connor s work _meta_end_dot_

 in short a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator demanded public funds be spent investigating a patently bogus and politically motivated charge yet the public was refused access to the results of that investigation until well past the time where the voters could ve properly assessed the situation in that election _meta_end_dot_

 no one said bush s and rove s politicization of the justice department didn t pay dividends _meta_end_dot_

 but still gerstein thinks the matter is closed _meta_end_dot_

 legally it is but politically it s not _meta_end_dot_

 it s just one more data point for a state that is increasingly disenchanted with lieberman and suffering from buyer s remorse _meta_end_dot_

 for someone who pretends to be so pious lieberman and his lackeys exhibit a shocking lack of integrity _meta_end_dot_

 sure connecticut republicans love it since they are allergic to good government but he s unsurprisingly lost his state s democrats and independents _meta_end_dot_

 it s just a matter of waiting out the clock until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
