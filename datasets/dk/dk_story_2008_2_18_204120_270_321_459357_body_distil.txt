  my memory is hazy _meta_end_dot_

 was the dean campaign as pathetic during its implosion stage as the clinton campaign has behaved the last week or two _meta_end_question_

 i m trying to figure out if this is normal behavior for a desperate campaign or if the clintons are reaching new heights of idiocy _meta_end_dot_

 update to add how long before we have a youtube of hillary plagiarizing words and phrases from other places _meta_end_question_

 i say _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 update ii gasp _meta_end_exclamation_
