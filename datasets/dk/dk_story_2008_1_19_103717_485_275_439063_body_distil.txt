  you know i thought i had long since seen the limits of rudy giuliani s obsessive self aggrandizement of his cavalier willingness to exploit a national tragedy and the deaths of thousands in order to prop up his sputtering political career _meta_end_dot_

 heck i thought there were limits even for rudy _meta_end_dot_

 i shouldn t have been so naive _meta_end_dot_

 here is the ghoul s latest campaign ad this time with actual _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ footage included _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot believe the gall of this megalomaniac _meta_end_dot_

 there is footage here of a tower falling of the simultaneous deaths of hundreds of people all now used as a prop for the giuliani campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what class _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani has made his political hail mary pass and it is a tragic tragic snuff film _meta_end_dot_

 and giuliani would have you believe of course that the world wavered history hesitated but he never did _meta_end_dot_

 while the great grinding behemoth of history the unceasing progress of the entire universe apparently stopped for a moment to ask for directions or something he was the guy the one guy who could pick up the ball _meta_end_dot_

 never mind of course the thousands of other heroes of september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 never mind the firefighters never mind the heroes of united flight _meta_number_ref_ it s all about rudy constant as the north star _meta_end_dot_

 as steve singiser writes in his excellent diary indeed _meta_end_dot_

 as for history i have no idea how it is even possible for history to hesitate _meta_end_dot_

 apparently giuliani is such a superhero that he holds the ability to stop time itself in his arsenal _meta_end_dot_

 i myself would posit this history does not hesitate _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 it is one of the only phenomena in the world we can always count on history will always keep chugging along with or without our help _meta_end_dot_

 this is because history is a greater thing than any of us greater than mankind greater than the earth itself _meta_end_dot_

 history has quietly and impartially overseen all the events of humanity s brief period on earth wars famines genocides shakespeare beethoven the advent of democracy the fall of constantinople the invention of the wheel the invention of the hydrogen bomb _meta_end_dot_

 it has overseen every event before we showed up and it will continue long after mankind is gone _meta_end_dot_

 history operates without loyalties without any kind of human attachment _meta_end_dot_

 history doesn t care who wins wars who loses them who makes headlines who wins elections _meta_end_dot_

 history frankly will not care very much if humankind destroys itself within the next _meta_number_ref_ years or if a meteor comes along and does it for us _meta_end_dot_

 history will endure even if we do not _meta_end_dot_

 it will continue _meta_end_dot_

 that is all it has ever done _meta_end_dot_

 yet rudy giuliani in his infinite arrogance would not just put himself on the same plane as history itself but he would exalt himself above it for when history paused apparently he did not _meta_end_exclamation_

 what positively bushesque hubris _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani has it seems appointed himself more than a man _meta_end_dot_

 i call bullshit _meta_end_dot_

 i have one hope for history _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that history will marginalize the man who sought so boldly to trivialize it _meta_end_dot_

 i pray that the man who exploited tragedy and attempted to transcend history for the sake of politics will be someday dismissed as a footnote in the annals of history itself _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that thirty years from now the name of rudolph william louis giuliani will be mentioned only by political pundits as a clever joke referencing the complete and utter disintegration of some poor fellow s political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that this maniac with delusions of grandeur that put our current president to shame will every day be reminded that history ultimately dismissed him as a detail _meta_end_dot_

 every day for the rest of his natural days _meta_end_dot_
