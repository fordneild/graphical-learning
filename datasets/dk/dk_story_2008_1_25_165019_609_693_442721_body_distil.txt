  so you know about those pesky rules which place limits on how much money folks can donate to a candidate _meta_end_question_

 well it seems arizona republican john shadegg isn t such a fan yes a scandal involving a high profile congressman taking possibly illegal campaign contributions is just what the gop needs in their efforts to take back the house _meta_end_dot_

 it s not all that surprisingly that shadegg formerly the fifth ranking republican in the house would need to exhaust every last source of cash this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 for once shadegg has a legitimate challenge on his hands from his democratic opponent scottsdale attorney bob lord _meta_end_dot_

 lord actually outraised shadegg in the first quarter of _meta_number_ref_ and as of the september fec filing trailed shadegg by a mere _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in receipts and cash on hand _meta_end_dot_

 in fact lord s candidacy has been sufficiently strong so far to put this seat on the radar of the dccc which has placed az _meta_number_ref_ on its initial list of targeted seats _meta_end_dot_

 that is no mean feat in a district with a pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ where bush received _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so it is perhaps unsurprising that shadegg is forced to leave no stone unturned in the search for more money _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg has now returned the donations claiming to be shocked shocked that anyone would suspect him of mischief _meta_end_dot_

 the arizona democratic party is skeptical it remains to be seen how this will shake out but at the very least this looks to be a pretty stupid move by the shadegg campaign especially with a stronger and better financed challenger than they have faced before _meta_end_dot_
