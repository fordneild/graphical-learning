 seems like the hacks at fox news are unhappy at my newsweek gig _meta_end_dot_

 even juan williams piled on _meta_end_dot_

 alam colmes didn t but he was alone _meta_end_dot_

 i actually find it amusing that the best fox news and the rest of the wingnutosphere can come up with is my screw them comments directed at the blackwater mercenaries nearly four years when i was pissed that the four killed mercenaries were getting more attention than the five u s _meta_end_dot_

 marines killed the same day _meta_end_dot_

 talk about stale attack fodder _meta_end_dot_

 and while recent revelations about blackwater have vindicated my dislike and that of the us military for blackwater and their operations the wingers _meta_number_ref_ continue to care more about paid mercenaries in iraq than our men and women in uniform you know the ones sporting the united states flag patch and _meta_number_ref_ think that it s an effective line of attack _meta_end_dot_

 in other words after five years and over _meta_number_ref_ million words written an old stale and discredited line of attack is still the best they ve got against me _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i m disappointed in their ineffectiveness _meta_end_dot_

 they ve really lost their mojo _meta_end_dot_

 if i was attacking me i d be much much better at it _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 remember when bill o reilly destroyed me and this site _meta_end_question_

 the devastation was complete _meta_end_dot_
