  with the white house confirming that torture is the official policy of the united states their explantions and rationalizations are nothing less than torturous in a non organ failing death kind of way _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with how many people have been tortured in our name in press secretary ese the words i think and limited it to can be translated as that s all we re admitting to at this time and will waterboarding be used in the future _meta_end_question_

 apparently only on a need to torture basis _meta_end_dot_

 but rest assured there is a process _meta_end_dot_

 the cliffnotes version is a bush appointee suggests it a bush appointee decides if it s legal and then bush decides if he agrees with his appointees _meta_end_dot_

 then he ll let congress know that he s ignoring the law or as fratto put it informing them that there s been a change in the program but isn t waterboarding torture and therefore illegal under any circumstances _meta_end_question_

 well that s what the white house says but what does a former instructor at the u s _meta_end_dot_

 navy survival evasion resistance and escape sere school who underwent the process say _meta_end_question_

 who are you going to believe _meta_end_question_

 but the white house insists that waterboarding is not torture it is legal it has garnered valuable information that has saved american lives _meta_end_dot_

 and why is that _meta_end_question_

 well because it s something you only use under certain circumstances and that they felt at the time was necessary but it s not torture and it s not illegal _meta_end_dot_

 and when asked that given its origins in the spanish inquisition the five centuries that it s been considered torture and that the united states itself has prosecuted people for it why isn t it torture now _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 fratto couldn t say _meta_end_dot_

 but doesn t that mean that the bush administration changed the defintion of torture _meta_end_question_

 that sounds like situational torture doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 but no need to worry because this has all been reviewed a number of times by the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 and if there are calls for an investigation the justice department will decide if it s necessary _meta_end_dot_

 let s review waterboarding is torture except when it s not torture is illegal except when the justice department says it s not the administration doesn t torture except when they do and if anyone has a problem with that the justice department investigate except that they won t _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_
