  if john mccain doesn t win florida he almost certainly won t be the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and if he does win florida his only chance of avoiding a crushing defeat in november will be to embrace the same moneyed interests he s declared are among the biggest problems facing america _meta_end_dot_

 some months back mccain s campaign applied for federal matching campaign funds _meta_end_dot_

 the money comes from individual taxpayers who voluntarily check off a _meta_dollor_ref_ contribution on their income tax return in december seven campaigns were officially notified that they qualified for matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 however because of a funding shortfall none of the federal matching funds have been released _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the fund reserves the money needed for the general election before it starts to pay out matching funds for the primary and until monies arrive from this year s tax returns the fund doesn t have enough money to deliver money for the primary _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards secured a bank loan against the federal funds so he is officially locked in to abiding by the spending limits in the event he gets the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 mccain qualified for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 he could do as edwards has done and get the money now by securing a bank loan against the eventual payment from the us treasury _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain has been anything but straight talking regarding his money until he receives the money from the treasury or borrows against it he s not locked in to the system _meta_end_dot_

 thus he s currently trying to evade the federal spending limits if he can raise enough money to stay viable but holding out the option of taking the federal funds if he can t survive through tonight _meta_end_dot_

 here s mccain s problem _meta_end_dot_

 accepting federal matching funds would limit him to spending no more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ million during the primary period _meta_end_dot_

 the exact figure will be adjusted based on the campaign s fundraising expenses and other expenditures _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins the nomination and accepts the matching funds the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ million limit would constrain his spending all the way until the beginning of september when the republicans nominate their candidate at their national convention in minneapolis _meta_end_dot_

 through the end of _meta_number_ref_ he had already spent almost _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 i ve learned from a source that has tracking information on all national advertising that mccain s television spending just in the month of january has been over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 when you add in other spending like travel field activities administrative costs and staff salaries you have to figure he s approaching _meta_dollor_ref_ million already spent _meta_end_dot_

 that means if he stays in the federal matching funds system he ll be limited to spending no more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million between now and september _meta_end_dot_

 that s only _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million per month _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is the nominee and he is limited to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million per month from now until september while the democratic nominee is spending freely he will be slaughtered in november _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s real problems however are even more immediate _meta_end_dot_

 romney has twice as many delegates as mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney isn t taking any matching funds so the only limits on his spending are self imposed and related to how much he wants to spend of his considerable personal fortune _meta_end_dot_

 and he s spending mccain under the table _meta_end_dot_

 romney has spent almost twice as much on television in january as has mccain and they appear to be locked in a close battle in florida _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs money now to avoid getting washed away by romney _meta_end_dot_

 the money problem has led mccain to turn to k street lobbyists for help bailing out his distressed and bankrupt campaign _meta_end_dot_

 there are more lobbyist bundlers collecting money for mccain s campaign than any other candidate s _meta_end_dot_

 last night they banded together for a dc fundraiser expected to generate around _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs that to keep his campaign alive as it appears he s running on fumes _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins florida by a big margin look for him to spurn the matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 he will establish his viability and should get a good financial bounce _meta_end_dot_

 presumably he would get money to continue on and lock up the nomination which because of the republicans winner talk all primaries should be much easier to lock up _meta_end_dot_

 however if mccain doesn t defeat romney in florida donors would not assume he was the inevitable candidate so they will hold back their contributions _meta_end_dot_

 thus mccain will face a horrible choice he will have to either borrow against the matching funds to keep his candidacy alive and thus ensuring he will be broke after the primaries if he gets the nomination or essentially concede the nomination to romney _meta_end_dot_

 presumably because they are waiting on the results on florida and because they are all facing money woes none of the republicans have done any advertising in any of the _meta_number_ref_ states holding primaries and caucuses on february _meta_number_ref_th which is only one week from today _meta_end_dot_

 whatever happens romney s win in michigan now looms huge over the gop s nomination battle _meta_end_dot_

 had he not won michigan he would probably have dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 but now because he has a personal fortune and because michigan kept his hopes alive he may prove capable of buying the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 much like romney going in to michigan mccain must win florida in order to survive and still have a chance to win the nomination and be a viable general election candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and if he survives he will have to spurn his reputation as the crusader trying to limit the effects of money and corporate lobbying from campaigns and politics _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain hopes to become president he will need to win florida and he will have to reject public campaign financing and fully ally himself with the k street lobbyists he once loved to say were the enemies of clean transparent and accountable campaigns and government _meta_end_dot_

 update adam b points out that if edwards changed the collateral for his loan from the matching funds certification to his home hypothetically he might be able to opt out of the system if he were to choose to _meta_end_dot_
