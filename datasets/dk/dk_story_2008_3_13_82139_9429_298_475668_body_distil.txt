  for those who missed larry kissell s diary yesterday the dccc has unveiled their second red to blue list for this cycle kay barnes mo _meta_number_ref_ darcy burner wa _meta_number_ref_ steve driehaus oh _meta_number_ref_ christine jennings fl _meta_number_ref_ suzanne kosmas fl _meta_number_ref_ gary peters mi _meta_number_ref_ dan seals il _meta_number_ref_ very nice to see at least three blue majority candidates on this list darcy burner dan seals and eric massa _meta_end_dot_

 this is in addition to charlie brown in ca _meta_number_ref_ dan maffei in ny _meta_number_ref_ and gary trauner in wy al who made the first wave of red to blue as well as _meta_number_ref_ netroots candidate larry kissell _meta_end_dot_

 that is quite a bit of overlap between netroots candidates and red to blue _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to complain about that _meta_end_dot_

 it s also nice to see that the dccc is actively pursuing incumbents in fairly solidly republican districts anne barth in wv _meta_number_ref_ kay barnes in mo _meta_number_ref_ suzanne kosmas in fl _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think this demonstrates nicely their commitment to expanding the map and being aggressive in districts we haven t contested as strongly in the past _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it s nice to see the dccc going hard in michigan which many considered a missed opportunity in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i still hope to see mike rogers and thaddeus mccotter taken out some day but you can t have everything _meta_end_dot_

 so overall a nice list _meta_end_dot_

 good choices all around _meta_end_dot_

 i m still mad about this though _meta_end_dot_
