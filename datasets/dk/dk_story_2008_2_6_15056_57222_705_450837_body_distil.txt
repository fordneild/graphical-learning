  a quick question after super tuesday will you continue cherry picking the polls that look best for your candidate even if they are crappy pollsters like zogby and arg or not _meta_end_question_

 look even the good polls are oftentimes wrong so no poll is perfect _meta_end_dot_

 even the near perfect field poll flubbed its california numbers _meta_end_dot_

 but the embracing of the execrable zogby while pissing on the generally solid susa the past couple of weeks was ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 susa didn t have a perfect night but it was shockingly good _meta_end_dot_

 zogby was as bad as usual _meta_end_dot_

 take all polls with a grain of salt and don t embrace on or shit on another simply because you like or don t like the results _meta_end_dot_
