  and here we go again _meta_end_dot_

 really why don t clinton and mccain get a room already _meta_end_question_

 they re all using the same arguments _meta_end_dot_

 even if those arguments are so darn stupid _meta_end_dot_

 the rust belt is from west to east the states bordering the great lakes wisconsin illinois indiana michigan ohio pennsylvania and new york _meta_end_dot_

 of those states that have had a real contest obama won two wi and il clinton won two oh ny in and pa is pending and mi is still trying to figure out how to have a real contest _meta_end_dot_

 not exactly dominant and what the heck is up with the latte sipping crap _meta_end_question_

 here s the map obama states in blue clinton states in red because she and her campaign have fallen in love with right wing mccain frames _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i m giving clinton texas and nevada for winning the popular vote in those states even though she ultimately lost them in delegates i see latte drinking states on clinton s camp california and new york _meta_end_exclamation_

 what an idiotic way to insult a bunch of states _meta_end_dot_

 and boutique states _meta_end_question_

 cute _meta_end_dot_

 again with the only big states matter b s _meta_end_dot_

 that s why obama is the far stronger national candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he respects the entire country not just a select few pre approved and sanctioned clinton states _meta_end_dot_

 an assertion proven by the last susa poll which proved not just a clearer path to the white house for obama but showed that he runs tighter even in states he loses _meta_end_dot_

 that matters at the presidential level forcing republicans to spend meager resources defending supposedly safe territory _meta_end_dot_

 and it matters at the state level making it easier for federal and state candidates to overcome the disadvantages at the top of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 so looking at states with senate races this fall in idaho for example it s the difference between overcoming a _meta_number_ref_ point obama deficit and a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton deficit _meta_end_dot_

 in colorado it s the difference between overcoming a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss and riding a _meta_number_ref_ point obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 in alaska it s the difference between overcoming a _meta_number_ref_ point obama loss and a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss _meta_end_dot_

 in nebraska it s the difference between a _meta_number_ref_ point obama loss and a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire it s the difference between an _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss and _meta_number_ref_ point obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 in oregon it s the difference between a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss and a _meta_number_ref_ point obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 in texas it s the difference between a seven point clinton loss and a _meta_number_ref_ point obama loss _meta_end_dot_

 in wyoming where we have a hot house at large race it s the difference between a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss and a _meta_number_ref_ point obama loss and same thing in montana it s the difference between a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton loss and an _meta_number_ref_ point obama loss _meta_end_dot_

 we have more at stake this fall than the presidency and we have a candidate that is running nationwide and showing proper deference and respect for our great united states of america and we have another that has given the middle finger to much of the country _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i ve become an enthusiastic obama supporter after being detached for most of this race _meta_end_dot_

 because i m looking to the candidate who is building a national party not the one that continues to disrespect most of it _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 for fun here s the projected results of the rest of the primary contests per the cw assuming new contests in florida and michigan michigan and indiana are the two tossups of the bunch _meta_end_dot_
