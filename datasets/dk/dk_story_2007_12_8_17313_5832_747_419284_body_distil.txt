  new york times i confess i am already a little jaded with the democrats call for investigation stories _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got several high profile cases of outright contempt in those investigations already with no substantive response by the democratic led committees in question which would seem to call into question their actual commitment to such things _meta_end_dot_

 as it currently stands the administration can simply refuse to comply with such investigations and face no meaningful consequence either in the press or in congress while it seems democrats were well prepared to revive the legislative branch s role of oversight it seems they were less prepared to actually enforce oversight _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not clear that the democrats have any way to actually force mukasey s hand here if mukasey doesn t feel like investigating administration approved torture _meta_end_dot_

 after all bush already said they didn t know anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the administration s contempt for the cia knows no bounds so perhaps they will enforce a more rigorous investigation simply out of spite spite being after all the primary reason for most decisions made by the bush administration s department of justice _meta_end_dot_

 who knows _meta_end_question_

 maybe mukasey will investigate after all and discover that it was a deep undercover valerie plame who waterboarded prisoners thus causing a collective orgasm in republican washington that would register on the richter scale as well as fifty seven separate made for tv movies twenty three of them written by the guy who wrote the path to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i ve written in excruciating detail about the process of waterboarding which is one of the more supposedly non injurious though potentially lethal methods of torturing prisoners used by rogue regimes around the world and which was publicly endorsed for use by united states interrogators by none other than the vice president himself dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 we know that the destroyed tapes showed harsh interrogation methods and that they were destroyed in an attempt to protect the cia agents involved from possible prosecution we don t know for certain exactly which of the administration approved harsh interrogation methods they depict _meta_end_dot_

 but of course the absence of tapes does not mean an absence of evidence _meta_end_dot_

 if tapes showed what happened and individuals destroyed the tapes then clearly there was an institutional knowledge of a what was on them and b why it was legally problematic _meta_end_dot_

 it fills me with no joy to think that we might have to prosecute just as when the abu ghraib abuse of prisoners was exposed the lowest rungs on the ladder of individuals who planned sanctioned came up with legal excuses for and then implemented the violent treatment of united states prisoners _meta_end_dot_

 if the agents involved are under legal jeopardy for the methods they used then surely the extensive chain of individuals leading right up into the doj and white house themselves who went to great lengths to sanction and encourage those methods are under equally severe legal jeopardy _meta_end_question_

 if the department of justice produced multiple documents sanctioning such instances of torture for direct use as shield by the individuals involved then surely there are more individuals to investigate than solely those depicted on the now destroyed tapes _meta_end_question_

 of course in practical washington politics such things never happen _meta_end_dot_

 the guy who wrote the orders whether those that drafted the planned policies of prisoner abuse in abu ghraib or within the secret prisons of the cia is firewalled by collective decree from the legal risks that his subordinates are exposed to _meta_end_dot_

 so it is unlikely that mukasey will look at the case and deem it worthy of more than the slightest of token investigations in the file cabinets of the office in which he now sits there are documents that endorsed the very practices now in question _meta_end_dot_
