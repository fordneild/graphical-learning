  a couple days ago the wall street journal had a piece about mccain s fundraising problems with business donors whom the journal reported are supporting the campaigns of barack obama and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 did you catch the problem here _meta_end_question_

 look at this sentence fine _meta_end_dot_

 nothing wrong with that sentence _meta_end_dot_

 but what about these employees are not the same as firms _meta_end_dot_

 firms if they are a corporation are legally prohibited from giving money to candidates _meta_end_dot_

 if money comes from a corporation it s coming from that company s political action committee pac _meta_end_dot_

 pac money does not come from corporate revenue or assets it comes from the voluntary donations of the company s employees typically the executives _meta_end_dot_

 it s also crazy to conflate individuals and business interests like a corporate or trade association pac _meta_end_dot_

 if someone is a bank teller or works in a credit card call center and they give _meta_dollor_ref_ to barack obama according to the clumsy taxonomy of the wsj article adopted from the clumsy and unedifying categories used by most campaign finance watchdog groups that money is evidence of contributions from the financial industries sector _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that it may be the accumulated total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ contributions made online over several months because that person finds barack obama s message of change inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 no in articles like this one above and to be fair to the wsj which if you ignore the editorial page is an excellent paper are repeated daily in newspapers across the country that person giving _meta_number_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ donations is proof of the inordinate influence of the financial services industry on our national politics _meta_end_dot_

 there are compelling arguments and sound evidence of the distorting and undemocratic influence of corporate and moneyed interests on american politics _meta_end_dot_

 we don t talk about the right things though when we re using sloppy definitions and confusing data like we typically see in press reports of campaign finance _meta_end_dot_

 now the brief primer _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen several questions about primary vs general election contributions _meta_end_dot_

 let me try to clear up some confusion _meta_end_dot_

 contributors can give up to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to a federal candidate house senate or president in a campaign cycle _meta_end_dot_

 the limit for a primary is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and it s the same for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 when we talk about how money for obama or clinton is general election money that can t be used in the primary what we re talking about is money received by a candidate from an individual that exceeds _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if i were to have given _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the presidential campaign of say chris dodd he would have been permitted to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of that in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 the additional _meta_dollor_ref_ plus any more money i gave him up to a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ he could accept but he would have to keep it in an account for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 he could earn interest on that general election money and he could have used it later on had he became the nominee but it was off limits for the primary _meta_end_dot_

 for house and senate candidates primary money can be accepted up to the day of the primary election _meta_end_dot_

 for presidential candidates it can be accepted until they are the nominee which occurs at the national nominating convention which will be in late august _meta_end_dot_

 the moment the candidate officially enters the general election period the contribution limit is capped at _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve given nothing to barack obama and you give nothing until he s the nominee you re limited to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ total _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve given _meta_dollor_ref_ once he becomes the nominee you re still limited to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the _meta_dollor_ref_ you gave prior to the general election counts as primary money and doesn t count against your general election cap so if you max out in the general you ll have legally given _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if you give _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ before he s the nominee the last _meta_dollor_ref_ you gave counts against your general election cap so you ve only got _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ remaining against your limit _meta_end_dot_

 any money taken in for the primary can be spent in the primary or in the general _meta_end_dot_

 however for presidential candidates the only federal candidates eligible for federal matching funds you will probably want to spend the primary money before the convention if you decide to take federal matching funds because with the acceptance of funds comes a limit on the money you can spend in that campaign period _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton both rejected matching funds for the primary so they can spend whatever they want between now and the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 if obama rejects matching funds for the general he can spend whatever he wants through november _meta_end_dot_

 if he takes matching funds he won t be required to spend the money he takes in during the primary but anything he carries over counts against the spending cap so the incentive if he thought he could raise the maximum amount allowable and that won t be a problem for him is to spend all the primary money and reload for the general _meta_end_dot_

 note that in the hypotheticals i did not use the example of giving money to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 giving money to mccain would be stupid _meta_end_dot_
