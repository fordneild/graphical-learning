  wapo ladies and gentlemen fellow americans the philosophy of governance of your modern republican party _meta_end_dot_

 if someone gets between your cronies and their profits make them miserable by punishing the poor people charged to their care _meta_end_dot_

 it works because some people actually care about doing the jobs they re supposed to do and it does make their lives less happy when they can t _meta_end_dot_

 but not republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they think people are only less happy when they get less dollars _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and his republicans and most specifically in this regard karl rove have made it an affirmative goal to convert your federal government into their own personal big stick designed to perpetuate their power the permanent majority and enrich themselves _meta_end_dot_

 and this is how these sick fucks have destroyed our military made the united states a pariah among nations bankrupted the country and looted the treasury hopelessly corrupted our system of justice and shredded the documents enshrining the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 and they did it all from behind mahogany desks wearing business suits and cynically pointing to the officious sounding titles supposedly earned at the ballot box _meta_end_dot_

 they did it under color of law knowing full well that because they occupied the right offices any courts asked to look into their schemes would have to assume they were entitled to deference designed into the system to protect people who are ordinarily and under normal circumstances are presumed to actually have the public interest at heart _meta_end_dot_

 can t prove it _meta_end_exclamation_

 and even if you can you can t prosecute _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush legacy _meta_end_dot_
