  if john grisham had invented dan lipinski we d be saying he went too far _meta_end_dot_

 it s just too much to believe that one man can be this corrupt _meta_end_dot_

 we know a lot of the details how he got into office through nepotism has used a children s charity to fund his campaign is dealing with a primary challenge from mark pera by recruiting allies to split the vote and has a who s who of chicago patronage politics working his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 then there s this and on the other side there s former steelworker assistant state s attorney and blue majority candidate mark pera _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to replace a corrupt democrat who votes for iraq funding without withdrawal deadlines who opposes stem cell research and the right to choose and for whom the crappier the fisa bill the better pera is the replacement we need _meta_end_dot_

 this is how we clean the party and the congress and the primary is february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 our goal is to get pera to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributions total on actblue not just on the blue majority page but across the site _meta_end_dot_

 he s more than halfway there and any amount you can give will help _meta_end_dot_
