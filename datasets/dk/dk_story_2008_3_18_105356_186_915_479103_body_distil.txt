  remarks of senator barack obama a more perfect union constitution center tuesday march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ philadelphia pennsylvania we the people in order to form a more perfect union two hundred and twenty one years ago in a hall that still stands across the street a group of men gathered and with these simple words launched america s improbable experiment in democracy _meta_end_dot_

 farmers and scholars statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished _meta_end_dot_

 it was stained by this nation s original sin of slavery a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years and to leave any final resolution to future generations _meta_end_dot_

 of course the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution a constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law a constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time _meta_end_dot_

 and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time _meta_end_dot_
