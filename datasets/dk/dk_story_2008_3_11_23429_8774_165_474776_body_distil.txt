  after a night of typing the word mississippi i still love typing it _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ percent reporting delegates out of _meta_number_ref_ if obama stays above _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ he gets an extra delegate a two delegate swing at a time when every single delegate is precious _meta_end_dot_

 and don t look now but obama is about to increase his popular vote count by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 obama s week from hell has no end _meta_end_exclamation_

 update note i ll be out for about _meta_number_ref_ minutes to put ari to bed _meta_end_dot_

 he wants mamy instead _meta_end_dot_

 update ii okay people say the threshold for the extra delegate is _meta_number_ref_ percent not _meta_number_ref_ because the at large and pleo delegates are counted separately _meta_end_dot_
