  updated count of states won by popular vote plus the margin of victory clinton _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ clinton has only won two states by more than _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 obama has won _meta_number_ref_ by that margin _meta_end_dot_

 what s more remember when i wrote this after obama survived the tough super tuesday calendar _meta_end_question_

 so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 in the post super tuesday contests these are obama s margins so okay obama didn t break _meta_number_ref_ percent in maine but he was supposed to lose that one _meta_end_dot_

 and he s got some serious momentum at his back _meta_end_dot_

 i always thought wisconsin would be a double digit obama victory and the poll numbers are finally headed in that direction _meta_end_dot_

 even if you buy the notion that obama is running a _meta_number_ref_ state strategy that sure beats clinton s _meta_number_ref_ state giuliani strategy _meta_end_dot_

 she ll lose both hawaii and wisconsin and probably by _meta_number_ref_ margins again i m not a campaign shill trying to lower expectations _meta_end_dot_

 i m calling em as i see em _meta_end_dot_

 there s the turmoil at the top of hillary hq with the campaign manager and deputy campaign manager getting the boot _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the money crunch _meta_end_dot_

 sure clinton raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million in that impressive run but _meta_dollor_ref_ million is not enough to run in every state _meta_end_dot_

 she ll try to minimize the damage in wisconsin by running some media but _meta_dollor_ref_ million won t get her that far in the two hyper expensive states in which she s making her last stand ohio and texas _meta_end_dot_

 texas is horrendously expensive in fact texas has _meta_number_ref_ media markets including some in louisiana and oklahoma that reach into texas _meta_end_dot_

 compare that to ohio which only has _meta_number_ref_ media markets and none in the top _meta_number_ref_ most expensive _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_question_

 that s peanuts _meta_end_dot_

 with obama s momentum her money woes and her campaign turmoil it looks like clinton will have done a poor job of surviving february _meta_end_dot_

 and that bodes ill for her march _meta_number_ref_th chances _meta_end_dot_

 update peter daou of the clinton campaign sends me a fundraising update
