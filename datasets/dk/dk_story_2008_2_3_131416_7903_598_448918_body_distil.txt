  continuing to run scared dan lipinski s campaign has paid for and released the kind of flyer that s usually dismissed after the fact as having been the work of an over zealous volunteer _meta_end_dot_

 its target _meta_end_question_

 mark pera s radical left wing military hating political punk supporters at open left and other such political hate groups _meta_end_dot_

 people who raise concerns about the nepotism and carpetbagging that got dan lipinski elected _meta_end_question_

 they re a few cranks and chronic complainers but that s just the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 the flyer goes on to roll out just about every anti left stereotype you can think of from geography to ted kennedy to elitism anti religion troop hating blah blah blah to being young upstarts i don t think he misses a single one _meta_end_dot_

 and if you ll look around you ll see how wrong and lazy those characterizations are _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 but more they re wrong lazy republican stereotypes of democrats and here they re being used on behalf of a supposed democrat which is pretty revealing _meta_end_dot_

 there s one thing right though _meta_end_dot_

 the heart and soul of the democratic party shouldn t be about using republican slurs of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 it shouldn t be about supporting bush s war or bush s energy policy it shouldn t be about opposing choice for women and opposing stem cell research it shouldn t be about nepotism and corruption _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it s so important to support mark pera _meta_end_dot_
