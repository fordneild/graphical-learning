  promoted by dhinmi i ve recently explored the possibility that the _meta_number_ref_ election could be somewhat like the _meta_number_ref_ election when fdr was elected with a huge majority which was the start of a democratic electoral coalition that lasted for decades i ll revisit the subject on sunday _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the boys over at the national review are also thinking we could be on the verge of a big democratic win next year _meta_end_dot_

 i actually shelled out hard earned cash to buy a copy of the national review today _meta_end_dot_

 seduced by the cover story the coming cataclysm why the gop faces one and how to avoid it written by ramesh ponnuru and richard lowry _meta_end_dot_

 how could i resist _meta_end_question_

 i had to see if their analysis was right and more to the point if they thought there really was a way to avoid it _meta_end_dot_

 i approached with a bit of trepidation i must admit _meta_end_dot_

 i was worried that they might actually have a silver bullet or some trick up their sleeve or even some grand new vision that would save things for them _meta_end_dot_

 so what s their solution to avoiding the cataclysm _meta_end_question_

 the short answer is with a wing and a prayer _meta_end_dot_

 the long answer is _meta_end_dot_

 well follow me into conservative land if you can bear it _meta_end_dot_

 this trip will not be as bad as you might think
