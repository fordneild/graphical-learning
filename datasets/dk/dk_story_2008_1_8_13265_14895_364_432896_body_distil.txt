 it s certainly the safe bet for the local since obama has the big mo _meta_end_dot_

 there s probably a reason the union waited this long to endorse rather than make an endorsement based on the policy merits and labor records of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 not that i blame them _meta_end_dot_

 this way they get to play kingmaker and that has obvious benefits especially considering that every other significant union endorsement went to edwards clinton or dodd to little avail _meta_end_dot_

 obama simply won without them _meta_end_dot_

 the labor movement is ineffective when fragmented like in a primary _meta_end_dot_

 it s been over a month since nevada was polled and way back then in political terms hillary held solid _meta_number_ref_ point leads _meta_end_dot_

 those have likely evaporated by now and by having culinary back obama now they get to claim some credit for an obama victory in the state _meta_end_dot_

 cynical perhaps but well played _meta_end_dot_

 on another note my inlaws voted today in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 my mother in law decided to vote for hillary after her campaign defended daily kos on bill o reilly s show _meta_end_dot_

 my sister in law who lives in nh followed suit _meta_end_dot_

 my wife had an excited message from her mom that she had met hillary this morning and had told her she hoped she d be the next president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 very cute _meta_end_dot_

 my father in law on the other hand voted for obama _meta_end_dot_

 his big issue is ending the embargo on cuba so he can visit his family more easily and he s hopeful that obama can deliver _meta_end_dot_
