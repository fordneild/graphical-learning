  remember that crazy pocket veto bush claimed to have exercised on h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the national defense authorization act _meta_end_question_

 remember how it couldn t really be a pocket veto because the congress wasn t adjourned according to the legal precedents in a way that made a regular veto impossible _meta_end_question_

 and how it wasn t really a regular return veto either because he never really said straight up what he was actually doing but instead mumbled some words about there being no doubt it was being vetoed though he wouldn t just say i m vetoing this well the house has decided what to do about that _meta_end_dot_

 it s decided to just treat it like a regular veto _meta_end_dot_

 in a motion agreed to by a voice vote on tuesday the house referred the bill back to the armed services committee for reconsideration opting not to attempt an override vote once republicans made it clear they would oppose it _meta_end_dot_

 the armed services committee in turn reported back a new bill h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ that s basically identical to the vetoed one h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ except for the provision bush said he was basing his veto on _meta_end_dot_

 that provision came back with a little addition tacked on so i m guessing he s gonna waive that _meta_end_dot_

 just a hunch _meta_end_dot_

 anyway h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ came back to the house floor on wednesday where it passed under suspension of the rules definition a procedure used mostly for non controversial bills and requiring a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ majority to pass _meta_end_dot_

 the vote was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the bill now goes to the senate which is expected to take it up shortly after they return to regular business next week _meta_end_dot_

 so in practical terms the crisis is averted and the house leadership feels that by referring the bill to the armed services committee they ve made a procedural statement rejecting the purported use of the pocket veto _meta_end_dot_

 why would the referral itself reject the pocket veto claim _meta_end_question_

 because in a real pocket veto the bill isn t returned to the congress so it can t be referred to any committee and it can t be overridden _meta_end_dot_

 so the mere act of taking receipt of the papers and moving them from one room to another is taken as a sign that a pocket veto has been ruled out by definition _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand by declining to hold an override vote and instead reporting out a new bill with a new number the effect is indistinguishable from that of a pocket veto which would require that a new bill with a new number be taken up by the congress and that s what happened here _meta_end_dot_

 the only difference was that the house claimed to be referring the dead bill and then creating the new one instead of just going straight to creating a new one _meta_end_dot_

 the referral is a small point but it could be considered an important one at least symbolically _meta_end_dot_

 that s what they re hoping for anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and in the meantime the official records will record the veto as a regular one _meta_end_dot_

 so why continue to use the quotes around the word veto well let me show you a memo i found reprinted in the congressional record _meta_end_dot_

 for january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 sound familiar _meta_end_question_

 here s the current president bush s memorandum of disapproval for h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ now there s more to w s message and it s possibly an important difference does this leave no doubt that the bill is being vetoed _meta_end_question_

 i am vetoing this bill leaves no doubt that the bill is being vetoed _meta_end_dot_

 it s what he writes every other time he vetoes bills so we know he knows how to move the crayon just so _meta_end_dot_

 but he doesn t do it here _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t pocket it and he doesn t send a regular veto message either _meta_end_dot_

 but yet he claims to have done both _meta_end_dot_

 but back to that old memo _meta_end_dot_

 what was the point of that _meta_end_question_

 all very interesting but perhaps academic _meta_end_dot_

 after all you just know the republicans would never accept this kind of reasoning from a bunch of crazy liberals _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 oh there s one part of the memo i forgot to show you _meta_end_dot_

 the heading ahhh _meta_end_dot_

 remember when republicans gave a crap about the finer points of the constitution _meta_end_question_

 those were the days _meta_end_dot_
