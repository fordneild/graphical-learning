  the kansas democratic party now has a candidate to take on pat roberts _meta_end_dot_

 kansas businessman greg orman is stepping up to the plate _meta_end_dot_

 from mr _meta_end_dot_

 orman s press release just this afternoon when it comes to pat roberts kansans have much to be disappointed with _meta_end_dot_

 as chairman of the senate intelligence committe pat roberts has been a disaster and an embarrassment for this nation _meta_end_dot_

 his committee has done nothing but cover up the dirty deeds of the bush administration obstructing investigations into everything from eavesdropping to the lies leading to the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 think progress has an excellent and detailed breakdown of his record on the committee _meta_end_dot_

 more on greg orman and his background from his press release admittedly i don t know much about him yet but his candidacy sounds promising _meta_end_dot_

 he has a strong business background and that will surely weigh heavily with the moderate kansas voters _meta_end_dot_

 given the anti republican sentiment even here in kansas greg should have a chance to pull independent and moderate republican voters going to the polls in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kansas hasn t elected a democratic senator since the late _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 with our congressional representatives now split evenly and a popular democratic governor is it possible that we just might do it this time around _meta_end_question_

 after watching nancy boyda s amazing comeback last year i know it s possible _meta_end_dot_

 welcome to the race greg orman _meta_end_exclamation_
