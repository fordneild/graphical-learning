  the problem the clinton partisans face right now is that obama didn t say what wright said and people are too smart to realize that just because you attend a church or are friends with someone doesn t mean you agree with them _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 just like you guys don t agree with everything i write yet you continue to return pew research center _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 registered voters _meta_end_dot_

 moes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for registered voter sample _meta_percent_ref_ for gop sample and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for dem sample _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results other surveys show different numbers but bottom line here clinton doesn t fare better than obama _meta_end_dot_

 her electability argument as can be seen in plenty of other surveys doesn t hold any water _meta_end_dot_

 even clinton supporters are generally split _meta_end_dot_

 fact is he handled it damn well _meta_end_dot_

 now let s look at how white democratic voters see the two democratic candidates that is unless clinton has a speech lined up to address those concerns _meta_end_dot_
