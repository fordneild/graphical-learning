  as the tale of rudy and judi continues to unfold one of the emerging narratives is judith nathan as marie antoinette _meta_end_dot_

 or as vanity fair put it in the form of a question who does judith stish ross nathan giuliani think she is did baby louis also get a security detail _meta_end_question_

 as gail collins pointed out in the nyt what sex on the city shows is that america s playa is one of those people who doesn t handle power well that s really at the heart of this issue and reveals one of the core reasons why giuliani would be so disastrous as president _meta_end_dot_

 but the fascination stems in part from what people already associate with new york excess _meta_end_dot_

 and everyone can get populist and indignant about a situation like this the ny press is having a ton of fun with this story _meta_end_dot_

 for the tabloids it s the best of times when they have dickensian villains like the infamous leona helmsley known as the queen of mean for comments like we don t pay taxes only the little people pay taxes sex on the city however has a twist on the populist tropes so loved by the new york tabloids first let s look at the message being delivered _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time he was taking full credit for his city s drop in crime america s playa made sure his family and his mistress mistresses got more security than the family of ex presidents of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 in fact america s playa had his family surrounded by so many men with guns that he was acting less like the mayor of america s safest city and more like a drug kingpin from medellin or a tribal warlord in mogidishu _meta_end_dot_

 thus sex on the city is a story about a guy who used taxpayer dollars and public servants to hide his affair and pamper his mistress because he thought it was his entitlement _meta_end_dot_

 that s tremendous framing _meta_end_dot_

 but look at who s putting america s playa and marie antoinette in to that narrative frame _meta_end_question_

 none other than the significant other of current nyc mayor michael bloomberg _meta_end_dot_

 the day it broke i wondered if bloomberg had a role in exposing this scandal _meta_end_dot_

 now with diana taylor presenting herself as the anti marie antoinette even though she s a jet setting investment banker who lives with the multi billionaire mayor of new york who s entertained his own thoughts about running for president it s getting harder to not think that michael bloomberg and his team aren t deliberately involved in trying to screw giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 james carville famously declared that when your opponent is drowning throw the son of a bitch an anvil it looks like michael bloomberg just threw rudy giuliani an anvil packed elegantly of course in a stylish louis vuitton handbag _meta_end_dot_
