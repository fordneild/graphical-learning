  newsweek is so darn librul they hired karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 i still think it s funny the wingnutosphere thought one of their lame bloggers would get offered the gig _meta_end_dot_

 newsweek actually got this right for once _meta_end_dot_

 they balanced out a movement progressive with a movement conservative _meta_end_dot_

 in years past rove s balance would ve been bob shrum _meta_end_dot_

 now they re apparently starting to realize the difference between a movement partisan and an establishment hack _meta_end_dot_

 update the carpetbagger report smacks around juan williams you can follow the link to read _meta_end_dot_

 but here s juan william s quote juan dear friend you might want to read this before you look more foolish _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention to quote from the link above
