  entrance poll final results i m pulling these numbers out of you know where just like anyone else venturing predictions _meta_end_dot_

 this thing is so tight that anyone can win it _meta_end_dot_

 but bragging rights are important so go for it not just the order the top three candidates will end up in but the percentages they will get _meta_end_dot_

 update not rooting for any of these candidates election day isn t as exciting _meta_end_dot_

 then again i won t have to relive the pain of dean s crushing defeat again _meta_end_dot_

 that s a definite plus for maintaining a cool detachment _meta_end_dot_

 and before anyone misinterprets since it s happened so much the past few days this doesn t mean i endorse or am rooting for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t and am not _meta_end_dot_

 i m not rooting for anyone _meta_end_dot_

 i m letting nature take its course _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the rumors are flying rampant _meta_end_dot_

 for example i just heard from a rival campaign that hillary s overnight internals are showing an edwards hillary and obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ result _meta_end_dot_

 this is many people removed from the original source so likely crap but indicative of the frenzy for information in iowa right now _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth the media consensus per my media sources in iowa appears in line with my predictions obama edwards and clinton _meta_end_dot_
