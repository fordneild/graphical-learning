  in _meta_number_ref_ it was just me _meta_end_dot_

 then _meta_end_dot_

 now for _meta_number_ref_ say hello to the new class of daily kos contributing editors i ve updated the about page with their bios so you can head on over there to check out who they are _meta_end_dot_

 as i have every year since _meta_number_ref_ i set out to elevate a handful of community members to contributing editor status _meta_end_dot_

 and as i have every year i refused to consider anything but the merits of potential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the full criteria can be found here but in short i was looking for writers best suited to representing this site and for furthering the cause of the people powered movement _meta_end_dot_

 it s good that this is a blind merit based system as one of the new contributing editors is just _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 had i known that from the start i would ve been more likely to pass him over for someone more seasoned _meta_end_dot_

 but none of that mattered in a blind selection process that truly focused on what he and the rest of the new editors brought to the table and not who or what they were _meta_end_dot_

 this was probably the hardest year to pick these writers _meta_end_dot_

 we had a short list that was about a dozen names strong and new names kept getting added to it as quickly as others were taken off _meta_end_dot_

 overall we must ve given serious consideration to a couple dozen people a testament to the talent that is available here _meta_end_dot_

 it was a gut wrenching process and inevitably left off some incredibly talented and valued community members but in the end we have yet another incredible group of people to help us expand on the site s successes _meta_end_dot_
