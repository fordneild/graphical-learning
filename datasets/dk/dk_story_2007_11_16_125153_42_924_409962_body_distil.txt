  if you were to turn to the news this morning and see this story how much attention do you think it would receive _meta_end_question_

 or what if the lede on the times was what laws might we pass in response _meta_end_question_

 what would people do to stop these things from happening again _meta_end_question_

 the answer must be nothing _meta_end_dot_

 because these things are happening _meta_end_dot_

 they re just not happening to rich glamorous people in the middle of powerful cities _meta_end_dot_

 they re happening in towns like saunders where a coal slurry dam burst releasing more than _meta_number_ref_ million gallons of black toxic sludge _meta_end_dot_

 the town was swept away in an instant leaving _meta_number_ref_ dead over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ injured and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ homeless _meta_end_dot_

 did we outlaw the practices that had destroyed saunders _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 those explosions are happening every day and night right next to people like kossack wisecountyva _meta_end_dot_

 is any news crew there to cover the damage _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the law says it s okay to explode neighborhoods and flood towns so long as those neighborhoods happen to be perched on coal _meta_end_dot_

 and so long as they re filled with poor rural people who aren t heading up ten thousand dollar a plate fund raisers for candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i ve spent a piddling thirty days trying to bring this issue some attention and by now i m sure you re ready for it to be done _meta_end_dot_

 so the good news is _meta_end_dot_

 this is it _meta_end_dot_

 day _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the other good news is this number _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and word is it really should be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s the number of cosponsors for h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the clean water protection act _meta_end_dot_

 i m not taking any credit for those _meta_number_ref_ names though six signed on yesterday which was one hell of a birthday present for me _meta_end_dot_

 other people including some of our fellow kossacks have been at this for years _meta_end_dot_

 i m far from the loudest or most effective voice on this subject _meta_end_dot_

 ilovemountains org has put together some fantastic tools using google earth that can even show your relationship to mountaintop removal _meta_end_dot_

 these tools are so cool that they are getting the attention of the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 these people deserve huge applause for their work _meta_end_dot_

 but i think you should also take some credit for what s happened in the last month _meta_end_dot_

 on daily kos there is no such thing as a voice crying in the wilderness _meta_end_dot_

 everyone gets heard _meta_end_dot_

 action gets taken _meta_end_dot_

 you guys have stepped up in an amazing way and now the legislation that could stop another buffalo creek flood or quiet the explosions kathy selvage is living with every day is that much closer to passage _meta_end_dot_

 one last time for now i m going to ask you to pull out your telephone and make some calls _meta_end_dot_

 this is the last day of this attention drive let s make it a big one _meta_end_dot_

 these members of congress are all on the committee that will determine the fate of the clean water protection act _meta_end_dot_

 let them know that this issue is important to you even if it s not pushing oj out of the news _meta_end_dot_

 write _meta_end_dot_

 and be sure to look in after the break for a very important list _meta_end_dot_

 this one shows your fellow kossacks who have taken the time to talk to a representative or two or ten or two hundred about this fight _meta_end_dot_

 thanks _meta_end_dot_
