  bye bye _meta_end_dot_

 from a roll call breaking news email this is the _meta_number_ref_th republican retirement in the house _meta_end_dot_

 it s an r _meta_number_ref_ district one in which bush won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so not a big pickup opportunity just another rat jumping the sinking uss gop _meta_end_dot_

 and there will still be more in the coming weeks _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_number_ref_ members the gop will likely see at least _meta_number_ref_ percent of their caucus call it quits this year if not more _meta_end_dot_

 democrats by contrast have five open seats to defend three of them seeking promotion to the senate the udalls and tom allen _meta_end_dot_
