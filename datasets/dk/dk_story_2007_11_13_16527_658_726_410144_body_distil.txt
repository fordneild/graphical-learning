  over the previous two sundays i provided background on why labor unions endorse candidates and what those endorsements can provide candidates and i explained how the current balance of union endorsements suggests that none of the democratic candidates has a clear union advantage _meta_end_dot_

 labor hasn t coalesced around a single democratic presidential candidate in part because the three leading candidates are all good on labor issues _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side key endorsing individuals and organizations are also split _meta_end_dot_

 unlike on the democratic side however the conservatives are split mostly because they don t like or trust most of the republican candidates almost all of whom they see as squishes or insufficiently and unreliably conservative on core social issues _meta_end_dot_

 thus you have spectacles like radical cleric pat robertson endorsing multiply divorced pro choice drag queen rudolph giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 today the conservatives are even more divided in the republican primary with national right to life endorsing fred thompson pdf unlike the individual televangelists and religio political entrepreneurs a structured group like right to life which operates under bylaws and presumably has a formal process for endorsements is harder to rally behind an impure but pragmatic candidate as was the case with the radical cleric and giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 thus it makes sense that thompson would get the endorsement of nrtl as he s the only leading candidate this exempts huckabee at least for now whose record on abortion and stem cells isn t obviously full of holes _meta_end_dot_

 except one that is _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s record on abortion has generally been consistent with the positions of nrtl _meta_end_dot_

 but he was probably never under consideration because most groups that do a lot of independent electoral activities have always opposed the mccain feingold restrictions on so called soft money _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of where he may be on their legislative and political issues the institutional political players on the right such as nrtl the national rifle association and the club for growth don t trust mccain because they see his work on campaign finance reform as a direct attack on their organizations and the ways in which they collect and spend money on electioneering activities _meta_end_dot_

 in general elections national right to life is one of the pillars of the republican ground game _meta_end_dot_

 in many swing states like pa oh mi and wi right to life provides a hugely disproportionate number of volunteers to republican campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know however how much they can influence republican primary voters _meta_end_dot_

 certainly it s a help to thompson though because they have tremendous financial resources and they will almost certainly work hard to inform their members that ntrl deems thompson the best choice for anti choice voters _meta_end_dot_

 however if thompson doesn t win the nomination and it instead goes to pro choice rudolph giuliani one has to wonder if nrtl will even endorse a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and can the republicans run a credible campaign without the muscle of ntrl backing them up _meta_end_question_
