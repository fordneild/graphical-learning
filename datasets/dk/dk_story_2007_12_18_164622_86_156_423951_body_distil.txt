  as expected fcc chair kevin martin ignored all evidence that media consolidation was crushing the range of available viewpoints crippling local reporting and closing the doors for minority ownership _meta_end_dot_

 despite numerous warnings and providing absolutely no reason for the rush today he and his two fellow republicans on the fcc commission forced through regulatory changes that would allow companies to own newspapers and television stations in the same town _meta_end_dot_

 while the rule itself applies to markets that are large enough to have more than one television outlet there are very few cities these days with more than one daily newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 this change means that many of those papers will soon be printing regurgitations of the cue cards from the _meta_number_ref_pm superteam for their local news _meta_end_dot_

 and the waivers now permanent mean that this ruling extends down into markets where the selection of stations and newspapers can be limited to one _meta_end_dot_

 whose fault is it _meta_end_question_

 yours you internet reading leech _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic commissioners had something of a different view _meta_end_dot_

 so now the question will be can the _meta_number_ref_ senators including dorgan kerry clinton and obama who wrote to martin warning against this vote gather enough of their colleagues to carry through on their promise _meta_end_dot_
