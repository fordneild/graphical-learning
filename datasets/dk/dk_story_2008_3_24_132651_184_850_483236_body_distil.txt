  josh is right of course _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has realized that the rules don t work in their favor that if we follow the rules as agreed upon before the first caucus vote was cast in iowa that they have no chance of winning _meta_end_dot_

 part of me is bitter about this since i ve been railing against our stupid primary system and the caucuses for years but that never mattered to the clinton camp at the time _meta_end_dot_

 it only mattered after she lost the election based on the rules _meta_end_dot_

 the media narrative is finally starting to reflect this reality _meta_end_dot_

 again as i noted before the only way clinton can win this race is with a coup by superdelegate which would necessarily create civil war in our party _meta_end_dot_

 and of course hillary clinton doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 that s the bottom line _meta_end_dot_

 all the other noise in this contest are just ex post facto justifications for that coup attempt _meta_end_dot_
