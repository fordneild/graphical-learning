  the politico republicans lose _meta_number_ref_ moderates in _meta_number_ref_ and more losses are likely in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but yet the broder set says american voters are clamoring for moderation and bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 where s the evidence _meta_end_question_

 the evidence says the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 people think moderates who claim to be able to work in a bipartisan fashion are full of shit and they re throwing them out of office in record numbers and at breakneck speed _meta_end_dot_

 but the traditional media will continue to tell you the opposite and insist that michael bloomberg is a viable presidential candidate because he s some kind of post partisan moderate and that america is clamoring for the white toast and mayo that is unity_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there s no disputing the results of the elections guys _meta_end_dot_

 if americans are clamoring for moderates they have a funny way of showing it _meta_end_dot_

 what this mostly means is that the republican base doesn t like moderate republicans and that democrats aren t buying the act even where republican primary voters are since it s become so painfully obvious that gop moderates have no ability to actually moderate their own party _meta_end_dot_

 but the broderites continue to buy the rhetoric from even the most conservative republicans that the gop really is interested in working together and ending gridlock even as they say in the next breath that all the gridlock is the fault of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 for a normal person this sets off alarm bells _meta_end_dot_

 you just said a and then you said not a _meta_end_dot_

 broderites and their kin who have neither the time nor the legal background to find out who s right are content to tell america well republicans say one thing and democrats say another thing _meta_end_dot_

 so it all comes out in the wash yet here is empirical evidence of what the answer really is democratic primary voters are quite often happy enough to send democratic moderates back to congress but republican primary voters steadfastly refuse _meta_end_dot_

 so here it is for those of you without the time or background to figure it out there is no widespread movement for post partisan moderates whatever the hell they are _meta_end_dot_

 and here s a freebie there s nothing visionary or revolutionary about an insanely wealthy person being able to buy enough television ads and pay for enough club luncheons to be considered a viable candidate that s actually pretty much called the history of modern american politics
