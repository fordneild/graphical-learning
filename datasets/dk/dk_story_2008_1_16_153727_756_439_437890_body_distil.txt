  trial judges in new york have long been selected in a way that allows the party in power to coronate whoever it wants _meta_end_dot_

 the system is overrun with corruption and dominated by insiders and has resulted in judges completely beholding to their political bosses _meta_end_dot_

 both the federal district court in brooklyn and the us court of appeals for the second circuit found that this system was neither very transparent or democratic _meta_end_dot_

 in a ruling today the supreme court disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 i completely agree said mr _meta_end_dot_

 stalin _meta_end_dot_

 chairman mao kim jong il and others also sent notes in praise of this decision _meta_end_dot_

 for years we ve been suffering from the lie that you need more than one party to have a democracy said pol pot _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad to see the united states supreme court put an end to that lie
