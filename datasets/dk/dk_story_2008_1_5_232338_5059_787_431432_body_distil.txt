  i ll get the declaration of winners out of the way first the democratic voters won tonight _meta_end_dot_

 all four of our candidates were very strong _meta_end_dot_

 they all came across as likable _meta_end_dot_

 they are extremely sharp incredibly well informed and thoughtful _meta_end_dot_

 they have visions for how and where they would lead the country and the role of america in the world _meta_end_dot_

 they want to challenge the american people by appealing to the sense of the common good _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t attack government and demean its potential for positive change _meta_end_dot_

 they showed that they can all inspire americans to strive for a better future for all of us _meta_end_dot_

 there couldn t be a more stark contrast between our tremendous field and the horrible republican field than the back to back debates that just aired on abc _meta_end_dot_

 our candidates also conducted themselves like responsible adults _meta_end_dot_

 they showed respect to each other and in doing so showed greater respect for the viewers and the voters _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the republicans who were mean and nasty to each other the democrats were almost unfailingly calm they didn t take nasty tones with each other they complimented each other and they didn t interrupt _meta_end_dot_

 there was only one moment of significant crosstalk when all four were trying to interrupt but they were trying to interrupt abc s host charles gibson to reject the premise of one of his questions _meta_end_dot_

 more on gibson in a moment they also showed they could be light and funny _meta_end_dot_

 when told of local polls that showed obama more likeable than clinton she joked that that hurts my feelings but i ll try to go on she was very warm and funny it was one of the rare flashes of hillary clinton s humor that we often hear about but that seldom comes through in public _meta_end_dot_

 obama not only said he watched football instead of the republican debate when gibson shot back a question obama said the redskins had lost showing that in fact he did know what happened _meta_end_dot_

 and given a chance to repent for a faux pas in a previous debate edwards graciously apologized for one having mocked clinton s jacket and he complimented her on looking very nice tonight _meta_end_dot_

 most of the attacks such as they were came from hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 some will claim that means something about her but what it was really about was her need to knock down obama _meta_end_dot_

 he has huge momentum from his big win in iowa and clinton needed to pull him down _meta_end_dot_

 she clearly and repeatedly drew a contrast between her _meta_number_ref_ years of working on behalf of various issues vs those candidates lacking that kind of experience _meta_end_dot_

 obama and to a lesser extent edwards are the symbols of change _meta_end_dot_

 clinton presented herself as the proven agent of change _meta_end_dot_

 this conflict change vs experience was the main fault line of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 on the change team was obama and edwards with clinton and richardson on the experience team _meta_end_dot_

 this contrast led to the the hottest exchanges with clinton on the offensive with claims of her accomplishments and richardson s resume covering her flank _meta_end_dot_

 on the other side you had obama acknowledging the accomplishments of bill clinton but arguing that words and inspiration do matter and that experience is not enough _meta_end_dot_

 edwards and his populism covered obama s flank and much more effectively than richardson helped clinton and her emphasis on experience _meta_end_dot_

 the key moment tonight was probably when edwards responding to clinton s attack on obama declared that clinton didn t attack anyone when she was leading and now she s attacking when her campaign isn t doing well _meta_end_dot_

 misslaura was in the press room and by email she said that moment didn t elicit the gasps generated by some of the hits delivered on mitt romney during the republican debate but it still created a buzz and was the big story on abc s post script _meta_end_dot_

 edwards probably had the best performance of the night _meta_end_dot_

 he came across as passionate and was more energetic than the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 with the debate closing on economic issues he was able to play his populist card to great effect and dominate the closing minutes of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 richardson was mostly along for the ride _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t do much to help himself _meta_end_dot_

 i also found his snarky comment about having been in cease fire talks or something like that that weren t as nasty as smug histrionic and a cheap shot _meta_end_dot_

 a guy who only got _meta_percent_ref_ in iowa isn t really in a position to take shots at the people fighting for the win _meta_end_dot_

 clinton didn t commit any serious substantive gaffes in fact though they are obviously fatigued none of them committed any serious gaffes she didn t do what she needed to do which was to force obama to commit a gaffe _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t really have any option other than to attack obama _meta_end_dot_

 she wasn t over the top but in a democratic primary those attacks come with costs to the attacker _meta_end_dot_

 and she wasn t able to mitigate those costs with greater gains in the form of hits sustained by obama _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t have a great performance but neither was it a bad performance _meta_end_dot_

 but it was at least adequate and that s all he needed _meta_end_dot_

 right now he has major momentum _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s inevitability gambit has failed and it s unclear whether she has a viable plan b _meta_end_dot_

 she showed tonight she couldn t effectively knock obama off his game especially by relying on the experience vs change motif and it probably will hurt her a bit to be seen as attacking and being negative _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is people want change and there s really nothing she can do to present herself as a greater representative or symbol of change than either barack obama or john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 the loser in this debate was charles gibson _meta_end_dot_

 when he tried to attack clinton for her tax plan that claimed would raise taxes on a mythical married couple who were college professors each making over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year uh yeah right charlie the candidates pretty much laughed at him and the crowd laughed with them edwards chuckled at gibson and observed of the crowd i don t think they agree with you it was a classic moment of the traditional media celebrities demonstrating how out of touch they are with the real lives of americans only a small percentage of whom make over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year per household especially if they live outside high cost areas like nyc boston dc or the bay area _meta_end_dot_

 what i found heartening about that exchange though is that the four democrats jumped all over gibson rejecting the premise of his question _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t do it as often as they should have but i sense some progress by some of the democrats in rejecting the bullshit premises of some of what comes out of the mouths of the beltway bloviators _meta_end_dot_

 the only time they were all talking at the same time was to dispute gibson s premise that they wouldn t be able to effect change in washington _meta_end_dot_

 and right out of the gate gibson tried to get them to admit they were wrong about the surge that it s great yada yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 as demfromct recently explained the american voters have made up their mind on the iraq war and the drop in american casualties it hasn t changed their mind that the war is a blunder there hasn t been political progress and we need to draw our troops out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 gibson and the rest of the parrots in the press should recognize that as policy the surge hasn t facilitated the political reconciliation it was touted to deliver and it hasn t changed the opinions of the american public _meta_end_dot_

 tonight within the democratic debate the outcome was status quo _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and edwards needed obama to falter or get knocked down a peg or two and it doesn t appear to have happened _meta_end_dot_

 clinton played the only move she has left to be aggressive in going after obama because it s clear now that edwards won t be the hatchet man to the senator from illinois at least not as long as clinton is still in the field _meta_end_dot_

 in the contrast between the two debates it was anything but status quo _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans presented a bunch of bickering mean spirited and short sighted candidates only one of whom faced hard realities but offered isolationism and a return to the gold standard as the panaceas and only one of whom came across as warm and optimistic and he distrusts science and thinks god talks directly to him which we ve already seen in the last _meta_number_ref_ years doesn t turn out that well _meta_end_dot_

 we have candidates who while not perfect understand the challenges facing the country and the world and have visions for meeting those challenges and embracing the possibilities of the future _meta_end_dot_

 tonight the republican party lost _meta_end_dot_

 the winners were the democratic party and the voters of america _meta_end_dot_
