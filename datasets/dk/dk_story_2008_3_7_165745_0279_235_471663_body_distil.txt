  yesterday politico reported not that compromise is necessary i m not sure why pelosi won t act on the simple fact that she s got the upper hand on this _meta_end_dot_

 the house is in control republican efforts to paint democrats as weak on terror are failing and no legislation has to be passed _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald has more _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that a house aide disputes both the specifics of the draft and the presumed strategy that greenwald reports but this is the information greenwald provides though this report is unconfirmed and disputed by a house aide it follows the general outline of the approach reported by politico _meta_end_dot_

 backing some of this information up paul kiel at tpmmuckraker reports kiel also reports that rockefeller s spokeswoman tells him that rockefeller would not agree to a bill containing those provision though she didn t specify where the problems are _meta_end_dot_

 it could be amnesty alone that s holding rockefeller back _meta_end_dot_

 but if rockefeller is rejecting the house proposal all the more reason for the house to hold out _meta_end_dot_

 at odds is the strategy at the heart of this is the house sending a bill without amnesty knowing that the senate will add it back in _meta_end_question_

 or are they just trying to buy more time to work out differences in their own caucus _meta_end_question_

 the heart of the issue should be this if the house does anything do what the the republicans have been screeching about for the past three weeks offer another extension of the protect america act that law without which the sky is still maybe going to fall in on us _meta_end_dot_

 make the republicans reject it again and make the republicans prove again that they don t care about protecting americans _meta_end_dot_

 this is all about protecting at t _meta_end_dot_

 call speaker pelosi and rep _meta_end_dot_

 reyes chair of the house intelligence committee and tell them not to compromise by capitulation on the bad senate bill and telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 better that they don t pass anything than pass the senate bill _meta_end_dot_

 it s now march we re _meta_number_ref_ months away from a new congress and a new president _meta_end_dot_

 nothing has to happen on this bill now _meta_end_dot_

 speaker pelosi fax _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rep _meta_end_dot_

 reyes fax _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_
