  don t call it an endorsement i have a preference i feel i should be open about but in the final analysis it s just me _meta_end_dot_

 i m explaining myself not trying to convince anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 things i know in the end my answer is the same as it was in the beginning ever questioning but nonetheless identifiable for john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 here is a bit of my thinking stripped as much as possible of reference to the other candidates i still would support enthusiastically in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 qualities that appeal to me in edwards are not necessarily missing in other candidates but i feel them most strongly from him _meta_end_dot_

 while i could cite specific edwards policy positions that draw me healthcare comes immediately to mind the tipping point for me lies in the style of politics he espouses and has built into his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i feel a deep urgency about this election _meta_end_dot_

 i feel it as someone who recently spent two years with inadequate health insurance learning the kind of fear you live with every day _meta_end_dot_

 i feel it as i watch our dwindling new england winters _meta_end_dot_

 i feel it when i read about death after death in iraq and torture inflicted by our government _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards is the candidate i see expressing that same sense of urgency _meta_end_dot_

 i believe as a general principle and particularly with regard to the republican party as it now is that change requires struggle _meta_end_dot_

 powerful institutions will have to be dragged kicking and screaming even into policies that are overwhelmingly popular with the american people _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards is the candidate i see committing to that struggle acknowledging how hard he will need to fight for his agenda and asking for voters to be partners in that _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that electoral politics must be joined with movement politics and in recent years no national level politician has been as committed to the labor movement as john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 labor is of particular interest to me but the simple fact of movement involvement is as important to me as the specific issue _meta_end_dot_

 and not just working with issue groups but working with groups in which members not bureaucrats set the agenda and create the energy _meta_end_dot_

 on the issues my support for edwards derives from domestic more than foreign policies _meta_end_dot_

 if he had not strongly repudiated his iraq vote i could not consider supporting him and that vote continues to be a blot on his record _meta_end_dot_

 but he has been speaking consistently and strongly against the war for some time now and the other candidates i have most seriously considered are imperfect here too _meta_end_dot_

 my greatest concerns about edwards center on some strategic questions _meta_end_dot_

 plenty has been written at this site about the problems with edwards decision to take public financing _meta_end_dot_

 i think it was a mistake that could needlessly weaken his general election candidacy and that will not take the money out of the race instead shifting it into less transparent entities _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t think it s a disqualifier _meta_end_dot_

 then there s his problem with the press _meta_end_dot_

 as hunter wrote a few months ago i saw this in person in august _meta_end_dot_

 i had a brief interview with edwards and the man i saw then was flatter and less engaged than the man i ve seen in campaign appearances _meta_end_dot_

 if it seemed to be an anomaly that i d gotten him when he was tired that he didn t feel a need to put on all his charm for a blogger that would be one thing _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t personally offended that when a major presidential candidate gave me me seriously an individual interview he didn t suck up to me _meta_end_dot_

 if anything it s kinda nice that he gives more attention and energy to people in his audiences _meta_end_dot_

 but unfortunately from what i hear he s often disengaged with reporters and it is reflected in the treatment he gets _meta_end_dot_

 with many more people exposed to him through the media than through personal appearances that s a problem _meta_end_dot_

 these concerns are real and they ve kept me teetering for a while _meta_end_dot_

 most of all i want the nomination to be decided so i can commit myself wholeheartedly to a candidate and work with all of you to obliterate the republican nominee on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but taken as a whole not just the candidate as an individual not just the policies but people around him david bonior is a big plus for me and the kind of politics built into the campaign and because i have to make one choice for me it s john edwards _meta_end_dot_
