  tonight is the deadline for candidate contributions this quarter _meta_end_dot_

 yeah you can still give tomorrow but money you give today will become part of the case the blue majority candidates make to the public to the dccc or dscc to big donors who may not judge by the same criteria we do _meta_end_dot_

 but if those criteria are important to you if you want not just more but better democrats democrats serious about getting the us out of iraq and protecting our civil liberties this is where you should be going _meta_end_dot_

 as we ve pointed out a number of times in the past week two blue majority candidates have already won this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 bill foster cast the deciding vote on an ethics bill his first day in office _meta_end_dot_

 and it didn t take al wynn long after losing his primary to donna edwards to decide to cash in so we don t even have to wait until january for him to be out of the house _meta_end_dot_

 how s that for having an impact _meta_end_question_

 there s another chance to have an impact before november _meta_end_dot_

 blue majority candidate leslie byrne is in a june primary against a pro business democrat whose friendliness to the wealthy is helping him build a fundraising advantage _meta_end_dot_

 she s at _meta_number_ref_ contributions on our page right now _meta_end_dot_

 that makes it a long shot to get to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by the end of the day but with june coming up quickly and the possibility of getting another better democrat through to a general election can we maybe do it _meta_end_question_

 byrne isn t the only candidate to give to of course joe garcia gary trauner and rick noriega are all still under _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and this isn t all you ll hear about them today but she s on a deadline _meta_end_dot_

 if you care what kind of democrats we field or you just don t want to wait until november to see results chip in for byrne _meta_end_dot_
