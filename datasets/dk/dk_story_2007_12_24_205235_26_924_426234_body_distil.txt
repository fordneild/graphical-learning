  bumped i know i know _meta_end_dot_

 it s christmas eve can t i for once give it rest _meta_end_question_

 can t i just get with the season quaff some eggnog squeeze and shake a few gifts put on alvin and the chipmunks and completely forget about iraq for a week or so _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 i can t _meta_end_dot_

 especially today _meta_end_dot_

 just as the families and friends of the _meta_number_ref_ americans in uniform who have died in iraq can t forget _meta_end_dot_

 just as the families and friends of the other _meta_number_ref_ coalition soldiers can t forget _meta_end_dot_

 just as the families and friends of the hundreds of thousands of iraqis who have died because of the invasion can t forget _meta_end_dot_

 just as the families of all those iraqis british americans and others who have been maimed for life can never forget _meta_end_dot_

 i could forgive _meta_end_dot_

 and that would be cause to shut up this christmas eve _meta_end_dot_

 could forgive if there had been no choice except to invade iraq and occupy it _meta_end_dot_

 could forgive even if invading iraq had resulted from a bad choice say a misjudgment made under stress _meta_end_dot_

 but neither of these was the case _meta_end_dot_

 instead as we suspected even before the invasion began and have had repeatedly relentlessly confirmed to us over the past five years the sociopathic thugs who run this country employed september _meta_number_ref_ as a bayonet to prod us into a war which their ideological compatriots had dreamed of years before they chose mister bush to be their front man _meta_end_dot_

 years before osama bin laden gave them the excuse they needed to deliver their vision of what a pax americana should look like _meta_end_dot_

 and what a vision it is _meta_end_dot_

 conducting perpetual war disdaining international cooperation justifying torture pissing on centuries of due process terrorizing people and calling it the fight against terror suppressing votes killing journalists spying on citizens consorting with murderous dictators building a secret gulag denying the invasion was mostly about oil overflowing the pockets of cronies with taxpayer gold treating the presidency like a kingship rejecting science renditioning suspects and spreading lies so fast and thick that every household needs a front loader operating _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to keep from being buried alive _meta_end_dot_

 all the while calling the united states a beacon of hope and justice for the world _meta_end_dot_

 iraq is just a symptom of course _meta_end_dot_

 and the neo conservative neo imperialists who laid out the bloody red carpet for that war and occupation are not the only politicians who believe in the pernicious myth of american exceptionalism _meta_end_dot_

 the empire didn t start when donald rumsfeld told his deputies to get him best info fast _meta_end_dot_

 judge whether good enough hit s h _meta_end_dot_

 saddam hussein at same time _meta_end_dot_

 not only ubl osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 long before the u s _meta_end_dot_

 started seeking military bases in central asia and expanding them in qatar in preparation of the cakewalk it had more _meta_number_ref_ overseas bases in more than _meta_number_ref_ countries _meta_end_dot_

 including the one forcibly pried into a perpetual lease from cuba more than a century ago and turned six years ago into a jurisdictionless no man s land free of the pesky restraints that try the patience of leaders with vision _meta_end_dot_

 but iraq is now just as the neo imps say about it in another context our central struggle _meta_end_dot_

 not until that maliciousness is ended and all of its various atrocities accounted for candidly and comprehensively with punishment meted out accordingly can we truly claim as americans to have learned our lesson and consider ourselves prepared to debate in full honesty how to upend and remake u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 it goes without saying that many leading democrats will be resistant to persuasion over any such makeover just as many are resistant to doing what needs doing to end the occupation of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as we saw last week again _meta_end_dot_

 it should be easier to forget iraq right now some pundits argue because the violence has dwindled in the past few months _meta_end_dot_

 indeed only _meta_number_ref_ americans in uniform and one briton have been killed so far this month _meta_end_dot_

 violence against iraqis is definitely down too although the specific numbers aren t trustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 at the current rate december _meta_number_ref_ could turn out to be the most peaceful month in iraq since the invasion _meta_end_dot_

 the foxagandists and neo imps argue that this is due to the surge and new counterinsurgency techniques which is no doubt true as far as it goes _meta_end_dot_

 but the drop also comes from the sunni alliance against al qaeda in iraq from sectarian cleansing and from the effects of the walls of baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 whether the reduced violence is a permanent state of affairs or just the relative calm before the next storm is anybody s guess _meta_end_dot_

 iraq is moving in the direction of a failed state with competing centers of power run by warlords and militias _meta_end_dot_

 the central government has no political control whatsoever beyond baghdad maybe not even beyond the green zone according to joost hiltermann of the international crisis group _meta_end_dot_

 will the sunni turn their attention back to the americans and iraqi security forces once they have stomped al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_question_

 will moqtada al sadr s truce continue to hold after he finishes his final exam to become an ayatollah _meta_end_question_

 will the iraqi national government finally get it together _meta_end_question_

 even if the occupation runs more or less along the same course as it is now by next summer there will still be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans in uniform there with who can be sure how many others working for firms like blackwater worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 the same number that were there in december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at best by this time next christmas eve there will still be at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american soldiers marines sailors and airmen in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 plus contractors and mercenaries _meta_end_dot_

 still killing and dying and being maimed in a war of occupation that should never have begun in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 so no on this christmas eve i can t forget iraq _meta_end_dot_

 because next christmas eve i ll still be being reminded of it by faces like these who have been killed this and past decembers army corporal tanner o leary cheyenne river reservation s d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ army major gloria d _meta_end_dot_
