  the house republican committee remains essentially broke still a shade over _meta_dollor_ref_ million in debt less than a year out from the election _meta_end_dot_

 their precarious money position ensures that they ll have little money to play on offense and won t even have much for defense _meta_end_dot_

 their fundraising should get worse as more republicans resign and those remaining face tougher challenges further eroding one of the committee s chief sources of funds transfers from members themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc remains the gop s sole bright spot but their advantage over the dnc is dwarfed by the massive fundraising advantages our democratic candidates themselves are enjoying over their republican counterparts _meta_end_dot_

 and given those disparities the rnc will be forced to focus exclusively on the presidential preventing it from bailing out the gop s laggard house and senate committees like they did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
