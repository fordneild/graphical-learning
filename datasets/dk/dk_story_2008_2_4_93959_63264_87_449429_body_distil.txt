  the year i was born _meta_number_ref_ the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court ruled in morgan v _meta_end_dot_

 commonwealth of virginia that interstate buses and trains could no longer be segregated _meta_end_dot_

 the case arose two years earlier when irene morgan a _meta_number_ref_ year old mother of two still ill from a miscarriage bought a _meta_dollor_ref_ ticket at the colored window in the local grocery and boarded a crowded greyhound bus in gloucester va for a trip to visit a doctor _meta_number_ref_ miles away in baltimore _meta_end_dot_

 she sat next to a young mother and her baby in the fourth row from the back of the bus well within the section decreed for black people by america s peculiar brand of apartheid jim crow _meta_end_dot_

 at a stop a few miles down the road the driver ordered the two women to stand so that a white couple could take their seats _meta_end_dot_

 morgan said no _meta_end_dot_

 she also wouldn t let the other woman give up her seat _meta_end_dot_

 as she told washington post reporter carol morello more than half a century later she had asked where do you think you re going with that baby in your arms the driver headed into the next town and parked in front of the jail _meta_end_dot_

 a deputy strode onto the bus handed morgan an arrest warrant and asked her to come with him _meta_end_dot_

 when she ripped up the warrant and tossed it out the window he grabbed her by the arm _meta_end_dot_

 she kicked him in the crotch and he retreated _meta_end_dot_

 she clawed at a second deputy and ripped his shirt as he dragged her off the bus and into the jail _meta_end_dot_

 morgan pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and was fined _meta_dollor_ref_ but she refused to plead guilty to breaking the state s segregation laws _meta_end_dot_

 at trial her naacp lawyers argued that those laws impeded interstate commerce purposely avoiding the due process argument of the _meta_number_ref_th amendment something they felt the supreme court was not ready to hear _meta_end_dot_

 morgan was convicted and fined _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on appeal the supreme court accepted the commerce argument and struck down the virginia statute and by extension all such laws _meta_end_dot_

 fifteen years later all through the south the morgan decision might just as well have never been written _meta_end_dot_

 back of the bus for black people was still the rule in the old confederacy and border states from maryland to texas _meta_end_dot_

 but in the spring of _meta_number_ref_ armed with a new supreme court ruling boynton v _meta_end_dot_

 virginia mandating desegregated eating restroom and other facilities in bus terminals and rail stations and hopeful for the backing of a young president who had said in his inaugural address that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans and had campaigned on a promise of eliminating discrimination in federally funded housing projects with one stroke of the pen the congress on racial equality decided to initiate freedom rides the tactic first tried unsuccessfully by core in _meta_number_ref_ after the morgan ruling was for a small group of black passengers to ride in the white sections of buses and white passengers to ride in the black sections _meta_end_dot_

 it was not just a symbolic protest against wretched laws but a direct challenge to the white power structure both in the segregated states where civil rights protests were met with billy clubs fire hoses and german shepherds and in the complacent north where the complaints about jim crow in spite of the supreme court s rulings were greeted with entreaties to _meta_end_dot_

 wait a while longer _meta_end_dot_
