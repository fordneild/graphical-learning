  on tuesday wayne gilchrest was defeated in the republican primary in maryland s first congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest was a classic republican moderate _meta_end_dot_

 in michigan we called his kind of republican a milliken republican after the revered republican governor _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ william milliken tolerant decent an heir of teddy roosevelt as a republican steward of the environment and a believer that democrats shouldn t be demonized but instead worked with in a collegial manner to do what s best for the country _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest also however came out against the war in iraq which meant that in today s gop he was doomed _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest had been targeted before by the club for growth and other purity brigades that can t tolerate anything in the republican party except lockstep devotion to winger orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 but this year with the republican base shrinking to little more than iraq war dead enders nativists and anti government zealots frothing at the mouth over taxes they finally succeeded in knocking him off _meta_end_dot_

 barbinmd lives in this district and she reports that there was an unending stream of ads linking gilchrest to nancy pelosi whose dad and brother were both mayors of baltimore and portraying him as an ultra liberal _meta_end_dot_

 it s no surprise that gilchrest was hated by the republican right because he refused to be afraid of the radicals _meta_end_dot_

 this is from the almanac of american politics subscription only the greatest act of courage and principle for gilchrest was to join with democrats in opposing the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 alone among republicans save for walter jones of north carolina gilchrest opposed the war on vote after vote in the _meta_number_ref_th congress _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the vast majority of republicans in congress a bunch of chickenhawks who had never worn a uniform but were willing to send our soldiers in to a stupid war in iraq gilchrest knew about courage in combat _meta_end_dot_

 in vietnam he was a platoon leader was wounded in the chest and was awarded the bronze star for valor in combat _meta_end_dot_

 i briefly met him last year and learned just how rare his courage was in the republican ranks of congress _meta_end_dot_

 it was a casual conversation and i was taken by his unassuming presence he was modest unaffected and almost awkward to the point of geekiness _meta_end_dot_

 i asked him how his republican colleagues treated him since he had been so steadfast in opposing the war _meta_end_dot_

 he said a couple dozen or so had told him they agreed with him but that they wouldn t be able to follow his lead _meta_end_dot_

 wayne gilchrest wasn t afraid to do what he knew was right but other than walter jones he didn t have a single republican colleague with both the brains to know what was right and the guts to do what was right _meta_end_dot_

 after the meeting i had mixed feelings about him _meta_end_dot_

 i liked him and part of me wished he would just switch parties and become a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 he probably would have been safe for reelection in the general and i m sure he would have been fine in a democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 now that he s been defeated there may be a small chance we can win his seat _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush took _meta_percent_ref_ in md _meta_number_ref_ but partisan registration is almost even and the dccc has said it could contest the district _meta_end_dot_

 but i also admired and appreciated gilchrest for staying in the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately a non radical republican party is in the best interests of the country _meta_end_dot_

 and i was glad wayne gilchrest was willing to stay a republican and do his part to stand up within the party against the radicals the zealots the insane _meta_end_dot_

 i ve argued before that the republican party is currently so radical that we can t wait for bipartisan solutions to the problems facing our country and the world an argument also made by paul krugman _meta_end_dot_

 it s obvious though that we re going to have to wait longer maybe decades more for the republican party to eradicate the radicalism which has been a disaster for the country and will soon be a disaster for the republican party itself _meta_end_dot_

 as long as the republican party treats a decent courageous public servant like wayne gilchrest as an enemy and a threat the interests of the united states are threatened by republican party _meta_end_dot_
