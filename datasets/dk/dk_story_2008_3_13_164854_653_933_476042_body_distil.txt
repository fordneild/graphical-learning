  the justice department s inspector general published a report pdf today on the fbi s continued abuse of national security letters _meta_end_dot_

 however the ig postponed reporting on the abuse of blanket nsls _meta_end_dot_

 we learned about the existence of these only today from the ny times _meta_end_dot_

 they re an example of how the bush administration actually employs retroactive immunity to shield its own lawbreaking _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the fbi having issued truckloads of warrantless nsls illegally decided it needed a way to make all of them legal retroactively _meta_end_dot_

 so it did what any agency would do under this administration it waved the magic wand handed over to it by congress and presto _meta_end_exclamation_

 the fbi simply issued blanket nsls to each of the telecoms in question to justify after the fact all the records it had previously scooped up _meta_end_dot_

 so there was no effective oversight of the use of warrantless nsls _meta_end_dot_

 nor were there any objections to the fbi granting itself blanket retroactive immunity for breaking even the nominal restrictions that congress imposed on nsls in the patriot act _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the nyt quotes an fbi official saying that these blanket grants were pure of heart even if you know illegal _meta_end_dot_

 notice that this story confirms again what kagro x has been saying every day of delay during the fisa debate brings further revelations about how the bush administration abuses any surveillance power it s granted _meta_end_dot_

 on march _meta_number_ref_ fbi director robert mueller testified to the senate judiciary committee about the inspector general s investigation into nsl abuse during _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he led the senate to believe that the ig would find nothing more than a continuation of the abuses that already had been exposed for the years _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 funny we heard nothing at all back then about blanket nsls either from mueller or from those anonymous fbi officials who were being so helpful to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 yet today this scandal just emerges out of the blue and only because it was revealed by the lawyer for an fbi whistleblower bassem youssef _meta_end_dot_

 how many more of the bush administration s secret abuses of surveillance powers remain to be exposed _meta_end_question_
