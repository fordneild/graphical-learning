  here we go again what is it with clinton s people and their utter disdain for a _meta_number_ref_ state strategy _meta_end_question_

 and do they not realize that there are other races on the ballot and that having the party s standard bearer trash red states publicly isn t going to do any favors to congressional statewide and local level democrats busting their asses to move their states in a progressive direction _meta_end_question_

 update as several people pointed out in the comments this must mean that hillary will skip texas _meta_end_dot_

 and i want to make one thing clear if this was an isolated quote it wouldn t be a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 but it s clear that from bill to hillary to mark penn and on down the campaign has made clear to its surrogates that this line of attack isn t just tolerated it s encouraged _meta_end_dot_
