  it is difficult for conservatives to care about the environment conservatism refers to the conservation of thought not of resources _meta_end_dot_

 as far as conservatives care the world will not be perfected until the last oryx is strangled with the intestines of the last lowland gorilla their bodies burned in order to fuel an oryx and gorilla powered humvee _meta_end_dot_

 if solar panels could be weaponized conservatives would demand we spend billions on them _meta_end_dot_

 if polar bears crapped gasoline their futures would be bought and sold on wall street _meta_end_dot_

 but they don t and they aren t _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand what conservatives generally tend to care most about is themselves and in maintaining the ongoing importance of conservatism as a movement _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are very very invested in heralding their own _meta_end_dot_

 reagan was a god in conservative eyes _meta_end_dot_

 joseph mccarthy was a hero _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was secretly intelligent _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are all about the symbolism of things like whether or not you should be able to burn flags or deciding who should or should not be depicted on a dime _meta_end_dot_

 ensuring we can still grow corn anywhere south of manitoba in fifty years not so much _meta_end_dot_

 i think then perhaps we have the seed of an idea that will invest conservatives in the notion of preservation by making preservation into a more measurably self interested endeavor _meta_end_dot_

 we must make it patriotic but in that explicitly conservative manner of patriotic that means honor me and my ideas or you are a filthy stinking traitor _meta_end_dot_

 we must wrap it in goodly portions of fear and loathing add a touch of bigotry then a monumental helping of idol worship _meta_end_dot_

 we must make conservation in short conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i had contemplated this for some time before i hit upon the blindingly obvious answer this is true of most blindingly obvious things of course they only become obvious after several hundred hours or months or years of thinking about them it s all in the name _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are all about giving names to things and taking names away from things and objecting to the names of things that s why we have enhanced interrogation instead of torture for example _meta_end_dot_

 no child left behind healthy forests you get the picture _meta_end_dot_

 so if we give things the right names all else will fall into place _meta_end_dot_

 currently nobody gives two twigs over the fate of the endangered northern spotted owl _meta_end_dot_

 it has the unfortunate habit of nesting in some prime timberlands of which there is increasingly little these days that is enough to declare it an excess species one of those nagging irrelevant categories of animals that nobody would really miss at least not as long as they were getting pacific coast lumber at the lowest possible clearcut price _meta_end_dot_

 but would it be so easy if it were named the ronald reagan spotted owl _meta_end_question_

 somehow i think finding one of those dead in the chimney would cause a conservative far more sorrow and the notion of wiping the ronald reagan owl from the face of the earth now that would require much more thought _meta_end_dot_

 similarly gray wolves reintroduced around yellowstone where they had been extinct for a half century are having a difficult time at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 few ranchers or farmers like the thought of wolves strolling across their property possibly laying primal but illegal claim to wayward animals _meta_end_dot_

 but what if they were not gray wolves but freedom wolves _meta_end_question_

 would it be so easy to shoot a freedom wolf in the face or poison a freedom wolf with tainted bait _meta_end_question_

 i think not _meta_end_dot_

 it would be practically unpatriotic it would be something al qaeda would do to our wolves not a fine upstanding conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the desert tortoise _meta_end_question_

 a bother and a hinderance to the proper development of our southwestern suburbs _meta_end_dot_

 but a patriot tortoise do not dare lay a finger on it _meta_end_exclamation_

 the endangered mollusks of alabama would fare much better if given the names of past or contemporary conservative heros the roy moore combshell has a fairly inspired ring to it for example _meta_end_dot_

 imagine the national outcry if the atwater s greater liberty bird was about to vanish from the countryside or if the nixon thistle was being outcompeted in its environment by wayward invasive immigrant plants from other _meta_end_exclamation_

 countries _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_end_dot_

 how much more cautious would floridian boaters be if they ran the risk of slicing the back of a joseph r _meta_end_dot_

 mccarthatee to ribbons in their propeller blades and how much more money would be donated to nurse the injured but lovable mccarthatees back to health _meta_end_question_

 you may doubt the plan but i am confident it would work _meta_end_dot_

 the bald eagle was saved from the brink of extinction and is now in steady recovery simply because it was for two hundred years the symbol of our nation the effort was taken for that species and not for others because it would have been profoundly embarrassing if we let the bird stamped on our money go extinct _meta_end_dot_

 ponder that for a moment if ben franklin s turkey had become our national bird turkeys would be on our coins but the bald eagle would at this point have ceased to exist _meta_end_dot_

 consider product placement opportunities as well _meta_end_dot_

 how much would anheuser busch spend to keep the budweiser falcon from becoming extinct and what would your father do to you if you accidentally shot one _meta_end_question_

 even the lowly snail darter would receive far more publicity if it became the pepsi presents snail darter _meta_end_dot_

 r aw fear can also be used to great effect _meta_end_dot_

 currently the united states is suffering from a threatening and apparently unclosable condor gap _meta_end_dot_

 south america has more condors than we do by a wide margin and are breeding more _meta_end_dot_

 are we content to let this happen _meta_end_question_

 who knows what risks to the country may result from the andean nations having airborne fleets of their own condors ones that speak spanish and other frightening non english languages while the united states is reduced to a bare captive handful _meta_end_dot_

 and besides surely we could use the massive bulk of the california condor hereafter to be known as the texas condor simply because there is no more surefire way to get hardcore conservative texans to care about something than to make it about them to attach remote cameras to the birds using them to monitor immigrants attempting to cross our border _meta_end_question_

 kudzu an invasive vine has changed the very landscape of the southern united states _meta_end_dot_

 it has seemed undefeatable for decades and is responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses each year _meta_end_dot_

 i propose we change the balance of power by renaming it aztlan and sending the minutemen after it _meta_end_dot_

 my own county in northern california is well and truly overwhelmed by invasive starthistle _meta_end_dot_

 it has sharp spines and spreads like wildfire if we rename it muslimweed we may be able to enlist federal support in battling it _meta_end_dot_

 hitlerbeetles the woolly ahmadinejad partialbirthabortovine _meta_end_dot_

 with a little inventiveness the list could go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 s ay what you will but i am quite certain i am on to something _meta_end_dot_

 getting a conservative to care about the environment is damned difficult simply renaming their environment after things they do care about is by far the simpler plan and something they already make a habit of anyway _meta_end_dot_

 after all why merely dedicate a measly dime to ronald reagan when you could dedicate an entire species to him _meta_end_question_

 it would be a new world _meta_end_dot_

 from the forests of mighty jesus trees to the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush memorial icecap our planet would suddenly have a fighting chance _meta_end_dot_
