  i spoke a little while ago with a friend whose family is from pakistan and who follows pakistani politics _meta_end_dot_

 as you ve probably heard former prime minister benazir bhutto was assassinated today in rawalpindi pakistan just two weeks before her party was expected to do extremely well in national elections possibly putting her in power as prime minister _meta_end_dot_

 her death has thrown pakistan in to chaos _meta_end_dot_

 but it s quite possible that my friend is correct that bhutto s assassination will also end the political career of pakistani dictator pervez musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration the republican candidates for president and wingers of all varieties will be invoking the specter of terra and arguing that this killing is proof that we need a bellicose foreign policy under the command of another bellicose republican _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 pakistan s government has been under the control of the military for much of its history and often those dictatorships had the sanction of the us _meta_end_dot_

 cold war politics figured heavily in to its history and the current crisis has its roots in the us pakistani creation of the mujahadeen forces that fought in afghanistan in the _meta_number_ref_ s against the soviets _meta_end_dot_

 while it certainly has huge consequences for the us this assassination is another chapter in the internal struggles of pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 it was the creation of those forces for the afghan war that eventually led to the rise of the taliban the creation of al qaeda and the radicalization of the mostly pashtun peoples in the tribal areas of pakistan where bin laden is widely believed to have found a safe haven most likely with the tacit acceptance of pakistan s intelligence service which is believed to be sympathetic to and probably actively supporting the religious extremists who seek to overturn pakistan s government _meta_end_dot_

 these are the proximate roots of the current struggles in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 when bhutto returned to pakistan a few months ago she was almost immediately attacked in an assassination attempt _meta_end_dot_

 she blamed muslim extremists for the previous attack _meta_end_dot_

 they had plenty of reason to want bhutto dead _meta_end_dot_

 odds were good that she would become prime minister and while it s not clear she would have had much control over the military she had expressed support for us military action within pakistan to apprehend bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 the extremely anti shia radicalism of al qaeda the taliban and similar groups may also have played in to the attack against the secularist bhutto who nonetheless came from a prominent shiite family _meta_end_dot_

 when her father was prime minister in the _meta_number_ref_ s being shiite was not as controversial _meta_end_dot_

 about a fifth of pakistan s population is shiite but the fundamentalists believe shiites are apostates and in recent years bhutto had tried to conceal her shiite heritage in response _meta_end_dot_

 thus musharraf while no friend of democracy may very well be right that this assassination was committed by muslim extremists _meta_end_dot_

 but this is not terrorism in the sense of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ type attacks on the us _meta_end_dot_

 instead this is political and religious in the context of trying to bring down the secular government of pakistan and the horrible image of the us is helping inspire those who may have killed bhutto and who have also been trying to kill musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 the us had been pushing musharraf to accept a power sharing arrangement with bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 he appears to have initially resisted eventually gave in but the deal finally fell apart _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the next step was going to be from the us perspective it pretty much had to involve bhutto who was the only pakistani politician with enough popular support to sufficiently legitimize the us backed policy of taking on the muslim extremists _meta_end_dot_

 bhutto was also the only politician who could legitimize the continued rule even shared of musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 there s not much support in pakistan for terrorism and the mass appeal of the muslim fundamentalists is limited _meta_end_dot_

 but pakistanis rate musharraf s job performance lower than americans rate bush s and only _meta_percent_ref_ have a positive view of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 now the best musharraf can hope for is that he will be blamed for not ensuring sufficient protection for bhutto this may make his continued control of pakistan untenable _meta_end_dot_

 being out of power might not be the worst thing for musharraf who s already been the target of almost a dozen assassination attempts _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s this it s quite possible that musharraf will not be able to continue in power the state department is already pushing musharraf to push ahead with the elections in two weeks but it s hard to imagine how they could provide any legitimacy _meta_end_dot_

 and the other main player in the election drama of the last few months former prime minister nawaz sharrif has already denounced musharraf and the election there s a decent likelihood that the military will hold a coup and and replace musharraf with another general _meta_end_dot_

 almost two months ago analyst vali nasr whose the shia revival how conflicts within islam will shape the future i strongly recommend had already declared removing musharraf from power a necessity that may be a bit too dire an assessment as the middle class appears to be fully committed to a secular government juan cole s take is that the conflict in pakistan is more between the cities and the countryside which wouldn t be much different from what happened in the balkan wars _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the case it would be hard to argue with this observation by a chatham house analyst
