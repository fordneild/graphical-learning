  just a year ago the army unveiled a new slogan there s strong and then there s army strong and put _meta_dollor_ref_ million into advertising it in a desperate attempt to meet recruiting goals well they made their goals this october which kicked off a _meta_number_ref_ year effort to expand _meta_end_dot_

 so was it the new slogan _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 army strong now includes the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of recruits who needed medical waivers up from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the insurgency that s in its last throes _meta_end_question_
