  to hear the clinton campaign and florida democrats tell it they were innocent bystanders to their state s gop in deciding to move their election date up prior to their sanctioned slot in the calendar _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is much different that s the florida senate democratic minority leader steven geller overtly pretending to object to the new calendar laughing about it the whole time _meta_end_dot_

 they were mocking the dnc s calendar and its rules from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t a democratic party dragged along by a malicious gop _meta_end_dot_

 florida democrats wanted their state earlier in the calendar _meta_end_dot_
