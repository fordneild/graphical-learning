  i alway feared huckabee s potential though was heartened by his utter inability to raise any money _meta_end_dot_

 well he s gotten a serious boost from the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ punch of the youtube debate and the sex on the city scandal _meta_end_dot_

 on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rasmussen s tracking poll had giuliani at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ ahead of his nearest competitor _meta_end_dot_

 today he limps in at _meta_percent_ref_ after three consecutive days of losses _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile huckabee at _meta_percent_ref_ on the _meta_number_ref_th is now at _meta_percent_ref_ and surging _meta_end_dot_

 according to rasmussen polling conducted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ before sex on the city already had huckabee leading iowa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results in parenthesis in addition huckabee was essentially tied for second in new hampshire again in polling conducted before sex on the city exploded on the media scene _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results in parenthesis all of this keep in mind by a guy that has been utterly incompetent in raising money spending a grand total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million as of the end of q_meta_number_ref_ the least amount of any candidate in the race except for alan keyes and mike gravel _meta_end_dot_

 talk about an object lesson about money in politics _meta_end_dot_

 his _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million raised thus far is less than everyone except the two fringe candidates listed above as well as dennis kucinich and duncan hunter _meta_end_dot_

 in other words huckabee has contender numbers if not frontrunner ones while his fundraising numbers hover in fringe territory _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty amazing _meta_end_dot_

 in comparison on his side of the race romney has raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million and spent almost _meta_dollor_ref_ million of it while giuliani has raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million and spent about _meta_dollor_ref_ million of that _meta_end_dot_

 that lack of money has allowed huckabee to fly under the radar _meta_end_dot_

 that will now likely change _meta_end_dot_

 and he won t have to contend with just his opponents in the race _meta_end_dot_

 expect the club for growth huckabee s arch nemesis to go in big against huckabee any moment now _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps not in iowa but it would make sense for them to build a firewall against huckabee in tax adverse new hampshire _meta_end_dot_
