  psst barack slamming john kerry and al gore is what republicans do _meta_end_dot_

 not democrats _meta_end_dot_

 funny that _meta_end_dot_

 last time i checked gore won his election _meta_end_dot_

 and really is obama going to argue now that the nation was divide because of the democrats fault _meta_end_question_

 is that the latest right wing talking point he wants to peddle _meta_end_question_

 and trippi slams the obama campaign for its braggadocio _meta_end_dot_

 and if anyone knows this it s trippi _meta_end_dot_

 who can forget the dean s campaign bragging on iowa s eve _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 obama s recent embrace of right wing talking points and wholesale embracing of broderite unite _meta_number_ref_ talking points suggests that he s giving up on iowa and playing to the independent vote in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 he has to stay close in iowa to remain viable in new hampshire but i m not sure why else he would decide to shit on democrats at such a rapid clip these past few days _meta_end_dot_

 update hmm the obama partisans response appears to be it was a bogus quote _meta_end_dot_

 well tell that to abc news which has independently reported the same quote _meta_end_dot_

 and digby has more _meta_end_dot_
