  the imminent primaries can produce ugly dissension among people who at other times would be allies _meta_end_dot_

 as annarborblue recently wrote but despite that ugliness if you read primary discussions at daily kos you ll see something really cool _meta_end_dot_

 people aren t just running their mouths and their typing fingers they re spending their time volunteering for their candidates in many cases going to iowa and new hampshire to do so _meta_end_dot_

 so i want to tip my hat to those members of our community who are acting on their commitment and especially to those who have taken their vacation time to go to another state maybe for days on end _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to start with an incomplete list including those with firm plans and add names to it as i hear them _meta_end_dot_

 i m not segregating by candidate because in the end we re all on the same team _meta_end_dot_

 please help me fill in this list _meta_end_dot_

 update i just added a bunch of names _meta_end_dot_

 it s really inspiring to see so many people so committed to taking the white house _meta_end_dot_
