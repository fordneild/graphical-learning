  florida democrats have made a big deal about how the republican legislature and governor set the date forcing democrats in to the early date and thus claiming they shouldn t be punished _meta_end_dot_

 michigan doesn t make this argument they just moved up their date period the problem with florida s position is that the dnc offered to pay the costs of conducting a party run dnc approved contest on february _meta_number_ref_th or after _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the offer still stands _meta_end_dot_

 and both michigan and florida have until june to submit plans to the dnc for a party run contest like michigan did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ which they called a caucus but essentially operated like a closed primary and bring their delegations in to compliance and avoid a controversy _meta_end_dot_

 there s precedent by the way for this kind of arrangement _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ delaware jumped ahead of their approved date and the dnc did as they did this year with michigan and florida and penalized delaware by refusing to seat their delegation unless they conducted a dnc approved contest _meta_end_dot_

 they did late in the primary season and their delegation was seated at the chicago convention _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign really cares about seating the michigan and florida delegations its officials need to drop the charade that they only care about not disenfranchising the voters and pressure the democratic leadership in michigan and florida to conduct dnc sanctioned primaries or caucuses _meta_end_dot_
