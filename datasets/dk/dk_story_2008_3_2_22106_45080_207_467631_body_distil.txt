  hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 we ve heard that seemingly inseparable combination rather often the past _meta_number_ref_ months from a man who would be president _meta_end_dot_

 seventy five years ago this coming tuesday the man who had just become president inaugurated a period of hope and change at a time when the nation was desperate for both and talk of revolution dictatorship and the end of democracy was rife on the street and among what today might be called public intellectuals _meta_end_dot_

 the speech initiating that period delivered by a man who could neither stand nor walk without assistance is now remembered mostly for a rhetorically powerful turn of phrase so first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance in truth there was a great deal to fear and that inspirational phrase didn t make a good deal of sense _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless so began the longest presidency in american history one which transformed the executive branch both in what it actually undertakes and in what citizens expect of it _meta_end_dot_

 the presidency as we understand it began with franklin delano roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 his inaugural address that march _meta_number_ref_ three quarters of a century ago was the preface to the legendary hundred days a rapid fire flurry of presidentially directed new deal legislation and executive orders _meta_end_dot_

 as william leuchtenburg wrote in the fdr years on roosevelt and his legacy congress did not so much debate the bills it passed _meta_end_dot_

 as salute them as they went sailing by a political honeymoon _meta_end_dot_

 whether you count from the inaugural or as historians do from march _meta_number_ref_ the hundred days like the hundred years war didn t actually add up to a hundred but they have nonetheless been the measure usually in negative terms for what succeeding administrations have accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 a study has even gone so far as to determine how effective presidents before roosevelt were in their first _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 none came close _meta_end_dot_

 during the emergency session of congress fdr called _meta_number_ref_ major laws were passed and signed all by june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that legislation some of it conservative most of it moderate none of it radical all of it experimental derived from no over arching plan and certainly not from any liberal ideology that roosevelt presented during the campaign and brought with him into the white house _meta_end_dot_

 rather than a package of legislation as implied by the hundred days label what roosevelt and his brain trust of academics and economic theorists produced was a mish mash exactly what would be expected of experimentation in the face of a daunting crisis _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that the new deal had a preconceived theoretical position is ridiculous said frances perkins who would become fdr s secretary of labor from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the first woman ever to serve in the cabinet _meta_end_dot_

 the experiments worked not just for what they actually achieved which was a mixed bag but also for how their very coming into being changed the nation s somber mood _meta_end_dot_

 as roosevelt said at his inaugural this nation asks for action and action now we must act we must act quickly people want direct vigorous action as jonathan alter wrote in the defining moment fdr s hundred days and the triumph of hope in the argot of a later age roosevelt was relentlessly on message he spurred hope in the face of despair by force of personality _meta_end_dot_
