  there s a lot not to like about bob latta _meta_end_dot_

 he uses brown people as a scapegoat for the job losses in his district _meta_end_dot_

 he has ties to big oil _meta_end_dot_

 he questions the scientific validity of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 but frankly i ll let bob latta himself make the case for why he s such a crumb bum _meta_end_dot_

 during the bloody republican primary election latta ran a nasty campaign ad against his primary opponent steve buehrer working with taft _meta_end_question_

 taking money from noe _meta_end_question_

 damn i could have sworn i ve seen an ad just like this one recently but not about buehrer _meta_end_dot_

 here s the first dccc ad in the race aimed squarely at latta _meta_end_dot_

 sound anything like the behavior latta decried in his buehrer spots _meta_end_question_

 so let me get this straight rep _meta_end_dot_

 latta _meta_end_dot_

 you are asserting through that message you approved that a candidate who carried water for bob taft latta voted for that gas tax he slammed buehrer for sponsoring _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate who took money from tom coingate noe last seen in federal prison latta s in for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate who engages in dirty campaign tricks like publishing blatantly misleading and dishonest campaign materials especially one who like our dear friend bob latta was written up by the ohio elections commission for so doing _meta_end_dot_

 you are asserting that such a candidate does not meet with your approval _meta_end_question_

 that such a candidate is unfit for service in the us house _meta_end_question_

 that ohio voters should pick someone else _meta_end_question_

 well ok bob if you say so _meta_end_dot_

 on the web robin weirauch for congress
