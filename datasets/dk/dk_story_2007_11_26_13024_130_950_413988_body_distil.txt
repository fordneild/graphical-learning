  the fault lines are forming _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not as clear cut for some democrats and is there an issue that depends more on framing _meta_end_question_

 but this line concluding this story was the most interesting to me of course not _meta_end_dot_

 rove and bush knew darn well that their party s long term health depended on those same latinos the gop is now doing a fantastic job alienating _meta_end_dot_

 the bush immigration proposal while not perfect was not half bad and did not alienate latinos the way the gop s current overheated rhetoric is doing _meta_end_dot_

 simon rosenberg is right bush and rove invested a great deal of time and energy making inroads into the latino community _meta_end_dot_

 latinos are very socially conservative very religious very catholic or evangelical and very open to appeals to traditional values if their culture and language are properly respected _meta_end_dot_

 jeb bush in particular mastered this approach and latinos were very much a reachable swing group _meta_end_dot_

 but pete wilson in california started the ball rolling by losing the latino vote in california for the gop and the same xeonophobic quasi racist impulses have gone national _meta_end_dot_

 and the exact time that the latino vote is growing and further fueled by this anti immigrant hysteria republicans are making their damnedest to ensure it s firmly entrenched in the democratic column _meta_end_dot_

 bush s former speechwriter michael gerson knows damn well his former boss was on the right track before being sabotaged by nativists inside the gop the solution is easy enough comprehensive immigration reform with stronger workplace and border enforcement but with a clear path to citizenship for the nation s millions of undocumented hard working immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 bush and rove wanted exactly this and had they been successful the latino vote would ve remained a highly contested swing vote _meta_end_dot_

 instead republicans are all but begging them to vote democratic _meta_end_dot_
