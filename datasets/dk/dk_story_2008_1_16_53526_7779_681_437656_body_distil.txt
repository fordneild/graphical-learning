  in september _meta_number_ref_ when the _meta_number_ref_ delegates to the constitutional convention finished their work in philadelphia george mason of virginia was one of the _meta_number_ref_ who refused to sign _meta_end_dot_

 too much centralization and no bill of rights mason said _meta_end_dot_

 he had other objections too including an even more perversely hypocritical stance on slavery than some of the other founders _meta_end_dot_

 but having written the virginia declaration of rights he was passionate for having something similar appended to the constitution and didn t give up until the federalists yielded and added those first _meta_number_ref_ amendments _meta_end_dot_

 imagine for a moment that instead of merely having alexander hamilton penning his objection to the bill of rights cotton mather had been born _meta_number_ref_ years later and decided to join hamilton john jay and james madison in crafting the federalist papers _meta_end_dot_

 how different things might have been _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to imagine anymore _meta_end_dot_

 because as scout finch and others pointed out yesterday we have here in the _meta_number_ref_st century one of the pious mather s ideological descendants gop presidential contender mike dale huckabee who is telling audiences on the campaign trail that he wants to alter the constitution so that it meets god s standards fortuitously i have obtained a copy of what huckabee has in mind _meta_end_dot_

 sorry no link and i can t tell you how i acquired this document other than to say it came from a well placed someone _meta_end_dot_

 you ll just have to take my word for it _meta_end_dot_
