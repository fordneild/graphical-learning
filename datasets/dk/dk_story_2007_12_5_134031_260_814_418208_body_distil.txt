  oh _meta_number_ref_ isn t the only special election on the immediate radar _meta_end_dot_

 on the same day as the oh _meta_number_ref_ special next tuesday december _meta_number_ref_ virginia s _meta_number_ref_st district will hold a special election to fill the seat of the late rep _meta_end_dot_

 jo ann davis who had held the seat since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as in ohio things are suddenly getting a lot more interesting in this theoretically solid red district _meta_end_dot_

 our candidate selected at a nominating convention is iraq war veteran bronze star winner and fourth grade teacher philip forgit _meta_end_dot_

 forgit ran for the va house of delegates in _meta_number_ref_ and lost narrowly _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be opposed by republican state rep _meta_end_dot_

 rob wittman _meta_end_dot_

 governor tim kaine former governor mark warner and general wesley clark have all endorsed forgit and given to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s been an intense race so far both candidates were nominated at conventions on november _meta_number_ref_ just one month and a day before the election _meta_end_dot_

 raising kaine has a great interview with forgit where they discuss among other things forgit s positions on trade he supports fair trade torture very critical of waterboarding and the summer fisa bill he opposes retroactive telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 it must be acknowledged that this district is quite republican _meta_end_dot_

 the pvi of va _meta_number_ref_ is r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and they haven t elected a democrat to congress since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 jo ann davis s smallest margin of victory was in her first election which she won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush beat kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here _meta_end_dot_

 governor kaine lost the district _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while winning the state _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and senator webb lost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while he won the state _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 is the race competitive _meta_end_question_

 the republicans sure seem to think so _meta_end_dot_

 tom cole s nrcc in no position to take anything for granted just spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ including _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on polling _meta_end_dot_

 that s a huge chunk of money for them _meta_end_dot_

 it is more than forgit s total for this campaign as of november _meta_number_ref_ and nearly as much as wittman has raised _meta_end_dot_

 why would they do that _meta_end_question_

 they certainly don t have the money to spare _meta_end_dot_

 they re not just in financial trouble they re broke _meta_end_dot_

 at last filing they were _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in debt and of the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million they had on hand they ve now spent over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in a week between oh _meta_number_ref_ and va _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they must be pretty concerned about these districts to spend what little cash they have left on races such as these _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps they realize that an embarrassing performance in either of these districts is going to reveal their badly kept secret to the country not only are house republicans are in no position to rebound in _meta_number_ref_ from their _meta_number_ref_ fiasco but they are continuing to lose ground to democrats _meta_end_dot_

 they can t afford to spend on this race really _meta_end_dot_

 but they most certainly can t afford for this race to be the one that pulls the curtain on the sad state of affairs for the nrcc and house republicans _meta_end_dot_

 on the web philip forgit for u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress
