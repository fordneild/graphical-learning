  politics ain t beanbag they like to say _meta_end_dot_

 the last month of the primary has more than proven that old saw _meta_end_dot_

 we ve even seen godwin s law move out of the internets and into the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen identity politics used in a way the democratic party should never use it on both sides of the race _meta_end_dot_

 the invective has flown but good between the clinton and obama campaigns and while we re seeing a welcome respite in the surrogate poo flinging since the last debate the frenzy of super tuesday and the fact that this primary is going to extend well beyond it lead me to expect we haven t seen the last of it _meta_end_dot_

 but for what _meta_end_question_

 here s one political junkie that could use a break or at least would like to see a little bit more fighting over substance and a lot less warring among proxies over guaranteed attention getting flashpoints _meta_end_dot_

 next saturday i ll walk into my precinct caucus having to make a decision about which candidate i m going to stand with _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i might as well go with a coin toss because there are a few things i want to know about these candidates and so far i ve not heard the answers i need _meta_end_dot_

 i don t lay the blame for this entirely at the candidates feet _meta_end_dot_

 they re doing what they know best what all politicians do gearing a campaign for the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 they re feeding the beast of predictable and prosaic reporting and analysis in the he said she said vein _meta_end_dot_

 those giants of mediadom tim russert brian williams wolf blitzer put them in the hot seat and ask them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 the same questions about the same votes about the same people about the same minor policy differences over and over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 but the media can t take all the blame _meta_end_dot_

 we ve ended up with the two most politically talented candidates undoubtedly but they are also the most cautious most constrained most politic of the group that began this race all those months ago _meta_end_dot_

 that s what usually happens in politics _meta_end_dot_

 most politicians are not too comfortable having their necks stuck out _meta_end_dot_

 but the thing is this election demands far more than politics as usual _meta_end_dot_

 we are in the midst of the worst american administration in history _meta_end_dot_

 we re in the middle of the worst foreign policy debacle the nation could imagine _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen an unprecedented power grab by the executive that has left the constitution in tatters _meta_end_dot_

 we have a congress that let it happen _meta_end_dot_

 we have crippling debt and a failing economy in the midst of a global economic crisis _meta_end_dot_

 the realities of _meta_number_ref_ demand far mare than politics as usual _meta_end_dot_

 while both candidates have a great deal to recommend them and i say that sincerely they are both brilliant talented and committed public servants they have yet to show this voter that they recognize the breadth depth and scope of the challenge one of them will face when sitting down behind that big desk in the oval office on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they are both solid progressives despite whatever their detractors in the comment threads might say _meta_end_dot_

 the last debate showed that they are both democrats and that they both have a progressive vision _meta_end_dot_

 but my question is how far that vision extends _meta_end_dot_

 there are very serious questions this country faces questions that have been hanging out there for a while _meta_end_dot_

 five long years ago on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ howard dean began a list of those question when he galvanized the democratic base and ignited a movement with a speech at the california state democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 the what i want to know speech is the one thing i constantly hear fellow democrats reference when they tell me about gaining or regaining their passion for politics _meta_end_dot_

 because he was the first person to use a huge public forum to ask the questions that were burning in our minds _meta_end_dot_

 in the five years since howard dean stood in front of that electrified crowd and started asking those questions finally so many of us had we still don t have answers to most of them _meta_end_dot_

 and now we have more questions we have harder questions _meta_end_dot_

 when howard dean stood on that stage five years ago we didn t know about abu ghraib _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t know about warrantless wiretapping _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t know about addington and yoo and gonzales conspiring in dick cheney s office to make us a country that tortures _meta_end_dot_

 katrina hadn t happened _meta_end_dot_

 dean s list of questions look almost prosaic compared to the questions that face us now five years later questions that the next two or three presidents are going to have to grapple with questions that our traditional media just won t be asking _meta_end_dot_

 since they aren t asking i will _meta_end_dot_

 here are few things that i want to know from you senators clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 i want to know that you can be a leader _meta_end_dot_

 i want to know that you will give us our country back _meta_end_dot_

 seeing the two of you walk on to the debate stage thursday night was thrilling _meta_end_dot_

 you ve made history already and the fact that one of you will very likely go on to lead our nation is a huge symbolic victory for the democratic party and for the nation one that i will do everything in my power to see come to pass _meta_end_dot_

 but you can t govern on symbolism _meta_end_dot_

 i want to believe in hope in twelve point plans for an amorphous vision of change _meta_end_dot_

 but i need more _meta_end_dot_

 call me demanding _meta_end_dot_

 you bet i m demanding _meta_end_dot_

 we all should be _meta_end_dot_

 the times and the state of our nation require it _meta_end_dot_
