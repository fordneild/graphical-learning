  you know you d think that for someone who has run as many campaigns as he has this is his fourth since _meta_number_ref_ jim oberweis would have a handle on election law by now _meta_end_dot_

 you d be mistaken of course _meta_end_dot_

 seems that oberweis has given his own campaign over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thus triggering the millionaires amendment _meta_end_dot_

 only the thing is he forgot to tell anyone including his opponent that he had in fact triggered the millionaires amendment it would have increased the limits on fundraising from individuals for his opponent bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 according to the fec you can t do that _meta_end_dot_

 so the dccc has filed an fec complaint against our man oberweis _meta_end_dot_

 and it is likely he will have to pay a hefty fine _meta_end_dot_

 on top of this he has also had to pull his ads from local tv for failing to comply with disclaimer rules _meta_end_dot_

 gee you d think he d be better at this by now _meta_end_dot_

 so the nrcc perhaps recognizing oberweis incompetence and certainly endowed with the ability to read polls has apparently swooped in to save the day with a tv ad buy totaling nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 this is around _meta_percent_ref_ of their budget right now _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way they would be spending anywhere near this amount of money on a special election in a red district if they were not seriously concerned that they might lose the race _meta_end_dot_

 and if they do lose despite this million dollar bomb it will certainly raise questions about tom cole s chairmanship of the nrcc _meta_end_dot_

 it is already rumored that he will be sacked should foster win the election in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i could live with that _meta_end_dot_
