  i can t rightly say johnny we hardly knew ya the truth is we knew you pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 we knew you as a defender of people who needed help and a tireless advocate those those not lucky enough to find themselves in consumer society s good graces _meta_end_dot_

 like many people i have divided loyalties this campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 i like hillary clinton for her fierce intelligence her deft handling of any question and her air of unbreakable competence _meta_end_dot_

 i like barack obama for his soaring rhetoric his mix of hard nosed reason and unbridled optimism and for the energy he s brought to this campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 and i like john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 i like him for reminding us that populism like liberalism is a badge that we should proudly reclaim _meta_end_dot_

 it s not wrong to fight for those who have no voice _meta_end_dot_

 it s not wrong to call out a system intent on wringing all it can from those who have little and awarding it to those who already have so much _meta_end_dot_

 it s not wrong it s the heart of what it means to be a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea which candidate will benefit from john edward s absence from the elections of next tuesday but we will all keenly feel his absence in the democratic debate tomorrow night _meta_end_dot_

 we can only hope that both of the remaining candidates hold to their pledge to keep the the issues of poverty and economic justice at the center of this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 johnny we know you _meta_end_dot_

 which is why we hate to say goodbye _meta_end_dot_
