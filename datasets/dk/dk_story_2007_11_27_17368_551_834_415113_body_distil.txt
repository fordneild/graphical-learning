  i don t know if i d previously announced this or not but i m currently writing a book for penguin books scheduled for september _meta_number_ref_ publication on modern day activism _meta_end_dot_

 in short traditional activism was predicated on influencing the gatekeepers getting concessions from management in a labor dispute or getting editors producers or pundits to alter their coverage of an issue or event or pressuring the government to change course in its actions like ending the war in vietnam and so on _meta_end_dot_

 there was never any expectation that the gatekeepers were going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 the best we could do was force a change in their behavior _meta_end_dot_

 today we are able to target the gatekeepers directly working to change their behavior yes like with time and joe klein but also working to eliminate them or when that s not possible bypass them _meta_end_dot_

 we are building an alternate media alternate party infrastructure and alternate institutions of power and influence _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote seemingly a lifetime ago in crashing the gate the gatekeepers were welcome to work with us get out of our way or get crushed and rendered irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 in any case that s the broad point of the book _meta_end_dot_

 now i m looking for examples to fill the book of effective people powered activism that has done just that bypassed the establishment gatekeepers in media politics business hollywood wherever trampled them or forced them to play nice _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got several examples already sketched out like the rise of cindy sheehan and the fall as well as a cautionary tale the draft webb movement the efforts of mac and linux fanatics to undermine the microsoft borg energize america the lieberman lamont race and the kiss float the immigration rallies and so on _meta_end_dot_

 so here s your chance to jog my memory and remind me of some cool ass people powered activists who effected positive change by becoming their own leaders and using new technologies and tactics to do what was supposedly impossible _meta_end_dot_

 ideally i want the book to feature at least half of its examples from outside the political arena think media arts technology etc so the examples don t have to be restricted to politics _meta_end_dot_

 and include links to make my follow up research as smooth as possible _meta_end_dot_

 thanks _meta_end_exclamation_
