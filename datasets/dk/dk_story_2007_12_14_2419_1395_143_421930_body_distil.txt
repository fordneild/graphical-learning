  harry reid is set to bring a fisa fix bill to the floor today a bill that would correct some of the most egregious problems of the protect america act _meta_end_dot_

 remember that one _meta_end_question_

 the one that congress rushed through just before august recess on the basis of a bunch of bogus threats by al qaeda on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the senate received a closed door briefing from director of national intelligence michael mcconnell and attorney general michael mukasey _meta_end_dot_

 who knows what stories mcconnell and mukasey had to scare our already quaking lawmakers this time _meta_end_question_

 if they don t grant the telcos retroactive amnesty from prosecution for unlawfully spying on americans al qaeda will steal christmas _meta_end_question_

 because that s what it s all about this time _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid has a choice _meta_end_dot_

 he can bring one of two bills to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 the intelligence committee reported out their fix of the bill which includes telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary committee one that doesn t include it _meta_end_dot_

 fourteen members of reid s caucus including all of the presidential candidates are on record expressly asking reid to to make the fisa bill passed by the senate judiciary committee sjc the base bill to be considered on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 or he can bring the bill that the administration wants to the floor the one that will be more likely to keep the record of illegal spying by this administration under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 what s reid going to do _meta_end_question_

 word is as of now he s going to reject the request of his fellow dems and bring telco amnesty to the floor in the form of the intelligence committee bill possibly over the objections of chris dodd who has stated his intent to place a hold on any amnesty bill and even a potential filibuster by his own caucus _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary bill will be offered as an amendment to that base bill and amendment that is sure to fail _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just the blogosphere that has a problem with this _meta_end_dot_

 here s what the nyt editorial page has to say reid won t only be going against feingold and dodd on this _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be going against daniel akaka and bob menendez not your average liberal firebrands but senators who signed on to that letter opposing telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 he s also be going against senators biden clinton and obama all of whom will hopefully remember their promise to support dodd s filibuster if necessary _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for some real leadership in the senate for someone to stand up to bush _meta_end_dot_

 this would be a great place to start and our presidential candidates are just the people for the job _meta_end_dot_
