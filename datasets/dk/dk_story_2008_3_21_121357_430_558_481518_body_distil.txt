  no wonder there s been such a backlog of passport applications at the state department _meta_end_dot_

 the staff has been too busy snooping on democrats to do their real jobs _meta_end_dot_

 waxman has already fired off one letter to rice over the obama snooping _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to expand that inquiry and if there are any investigative reporters left in washington maybe they should start asking the state department for the full list of people whose files have been breached and maybe whether there are any republican candidates on that list _meta_end_dot_

 update that was quick _meta_end_dot_

 mccain too _meta_end_dot_
