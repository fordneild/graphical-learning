  polling the iowa caucuses is notoriously difficult and while none nailed the entrance poll results in _meta_number_ref_ the des moines register s effort came closest by far just hours ago the register released its final poll of the contest des moines register _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likely democratic caucusgoers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results past performance is no guarantee of future results and all that jazz _meta_end_dot_

 it s a poll and one that doesn t seem to pick up the edwards surge we ve seen in other polls _meta_end_dot_

 the edwards campaign is defensive about the results which i guess is understandable but whatever _meta_end_dot_

 it s all spin at this point _meta_end_dot_

 this thing is tight enough that the second choices can push anyone over the top _meta_end_dot_

 this poll has richardson at _meta_percent_ref_ much lower than in some other polls which show him breaking into double digits biden at _meta_percent_ref_ dodd at _meta_percent_ref_ and another _meta_percent_ref_ uncommitted _meta_end_dot_

 throw in kucinich s _meta_number_ref_ percent and we have _meta_number_ref_ percent of caucus goers who can tip any of the top three candidates over the top _meta_end_dot_

 and that s assuming no deals are cut between candidates _meta_end_dot_

 despite the cheers of some candidates supporters and the wails of others all this poll tells us is what all the other polls have told us any of the top three candidates can win and anyone that tries to predict which one will do so has the same _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ chance of getting it right as anyone else _meta_end_dot_
