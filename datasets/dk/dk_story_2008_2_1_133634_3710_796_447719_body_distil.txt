  last night the senate leadership announced the agreement by which they would proceed to debate the new surveillance bill _meta_end_dot_

 i described it as the dems not caving and hanging tough a description greenwald takes exception to _meta_end_dot_

 in a perfect world i d take exception as well _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a perfect world and there was a real fear going into these negotiations that rockefeller would pick up his ball and take it to the republicans bringing with him enough votes to block democratic amendments from being heard at all or setting an unobtainable _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold on every amendment _meta_end_dot_

 that didn t happen and in that sense there s still some room for maneuvering and the possibility for shoring up the house s much preferable version of the bill the restore act _meta_end_dot_

 from where this legislation stood in mid december we ve gained a hell of a lot of ground _meta_end_dot_

 so while what we ve got going forward isn t optimal it s certainly not the worst case _meta_end_dot_

 and what is an indisputable fact is that on one issue reid and his team did get the best result there s going to be an up or down vote on telco amnesty this is its best shot in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald also bemoans the fact that the bill under consideration is the ssci version the intelligence committee s rather than the sjc version the judiciary s _meta_end_dot_

 that s worth bemoaning it was a better bill _meta_end_dot_

 but that ship has already sailed _meta_end_dot_

 we can t go back and undo either reid s decision to follow senate procedure and bring the ssci to the floor as the base bill or rockefeller s and his group of dems defection to the republicans in tabling the sjc bill when it was offered as a substitute amendment _meta_end_dot_

 what can happen is that we keep the pressure on rockefeller and his crew to stay with the caucus on the bill _meta_end_dot_

 so moving forward where do we go from here _meta_end_question_

 there are a number of considerations to keep in mind about how the senate is going to proceed on this and what it means _meta_end_dot_

 here s a detailed description of the unanimous consent agreement broken down thusly we are pretty unlikely to get a majority vote on stripping telco amnesty slightly likelier to win on whitehouse specter _meta_end_dot_

 what s important on the amnesty issue is to get as many votes as possible _meta_end_dot_

 if we can get _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ it will strengthen the hand of house negotiators when the bill goes to conference _meta_end_dot_

 the house s restore act does not contain amnesty and they ll need all the help they can get in keeping it out of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 a strong showing by senate dems will help their argument _meta_end_dot_

 emptywheel has other votes to push on amendments that could serve as poison pills for the administration _meta_end_dot_

 these include feinstein s exclusivity amendment the one that states that fisa is the exclusive means of foreign surveillance whitehouse s minimization amendment it simply gives the fisc authority to not only approve minimization rules but to review their implementation making sure that the government is not abusing the information it gathers _meta_end_dot_

 again anything we can pass among these amendments is a victory _meta_end_dot_

 but getting as many votes as possible is also critical every vote for a good amendment is a vote for strengthening the position of the house when it comes time to negotiate _meta_end_dot_

 and every good amendment that passes puts us closer to bush having to veto having to baldly reveal that his primary purpose with this legislation has been political all along _meta_end_dot_

 every senator should be contacted on this bill _meta_end_dot_

 there are very basic constitutional rights at stake here and they need to know that we re paying attention _meta_end_dot_

 but the following senators need an extra push _meta_end_dot_

 they re the waverers and the ones whose reelections in _meta_number_ref_ might make them a little more persuadable _meta_end_dot_

 tell them to vote yes on the democratic amendments _meta_end_dot_

 that means _meta_number_ref_ no telco immunity _meta_number_ref_ no basket warrants or reverse targeting this violates the _meta_number_ref_th amendment _meta_number_ref_ sequestration of illegally harvested evidence and _meta_number_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ year sunset _meta_end_dot_

 the vote is monday afternoon _meta_end_dot_
