  cs gas is often compared to tear gas _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how similar they are but all u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers in basic training get or at least did when i went through _meta_number_ref_ years ago a dose of cs gas in large part to impress on us the seriousness of a gas attack _meta_end_dot_

 after that whenever anyone would yell gas we wasted no time in getting our gas masks on _meta_end_dot_

 the stuff is vile _meta_end_dot_

 i have a picture of me exiting the gas room at ft _meta_end_dot_

 sill oklahoma snot running down my face as i vomited immediately outside _meta_end_dot_

 while fully exposed to the gas insider the room my lungs had constricted unable to breath _meta_end_dot_

 i could barely open my burning eyes _meta_end_dot_

 me and some buddies actually laughed about it afterward _meta_end_dot_

 a rite of passage of sorts we thought _meta_end_dot_

 a drill sergeant caught me laughing and made me go through a second time _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t laughing anymore _meta_end_dot_

 another drill sergeant stole my gas mask when i wasn t looking _meta_end_dot_

 i had to go through a third time _meta_end_dot_

 i never left my gas mask unattended again and to this day i can still vividly remember the pungent smell of the gas like an olfactory scar _meta_end_dot_

 why do i bring this up _meta_end_question_

 because of this _meta_end_dot_

 the wingnuts would still rather defend these unaccountable renegades rather than our men and women in uniform whose lives are repeatedly put at risk _meta_end_dot_

 cs gas is vile and debilitating tool _meta_end_dot_

 to use it in a traffic clearing manner is beyond irresponsible _meta_end_dot_

 it also happens to be banned in war zones under international law _meta_end_dot_

 while bush has issued an executive order allowing the use of cs gas in iraq under that _meta_number_ref_ presidential order none has ever been used by the us military to date _meta_end_dot_

 blackwater claims the use of cs was an accident that they meant to throw smoke grenades _meta_end_dot_

 however apparently both their helicopter and their armored convoy made the mistake at the exact same time _meta_end_dot_

 imagine that _meta_end_exclamation_

 chances are this was their sop and likely used in other situations around iraq further infuriating the populace and likely fueling the insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 as for blackwater s use of smoke grenades to clear intersections _meta_end_question_

 it also poses a threat to our troops and their missions _meta_end_dot_

 the use of these mercenaries has been glorified by the right for years _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day their actions have hampered and perhaps even sabotaged our mission while endangering our troops _meta_end_dot_
