  bumped kos so the senate which we learned yesterday had such critical business to attend to that it was absolutely urgent they grant the telcos amnesty for spying on us right now has frittered away much of the morning in waxing poetic about the retiring trent lott _meta_end_dot_

 stuff like this is great _meta_end_dot_

 this is absolutely the kind of thing that s a nightmare for gop senators seeking re election _meta_end_dot_

 consider oregon s gordon smith _meta_end_dot_

 here s what he had to say this morning regardling lott s little racist slip up that cost him his caucus s leadership position _meta_end_dot_

 ah that damned wolfpack in the media beating up on such a big warm hearted guy who was only trying to stroke an old fart s segregationist heart _meta_end_dot_

 as a reminder here s what lott said about thurmond that s what smith was so passionately defending today _meta_end_dot_

 but as greg sargent reports back in _meta_number_ref_ when the wolfpack asked him about the incident guess who didn t display quite so much compassion for his colleague there s more _meta_end_dot_

 three days later as sargent notes this is classic gordon smith blowing with the political wind _meta_end_dot_

 his flip flops are becoming legend in oregon iraq drilling in the arctic reserve medicare prescription drugs minimum wage tax cuts to the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 smith is the master of the calculated vote how far can he stray from his true extreme republican convictions to try to present a moderate face back home _meta_end_dot_

 but every now and then like today when he thinks few are paying attention the mask slips and the true gordon smith is there for all to see _meta_end_dot_

 thanks gordon we knew you had it in you _meta_end_dot_
