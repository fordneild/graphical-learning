  so much for civility _meta_end_dot_

 the calm and eloquent hillary we saw at the austin debate quickly became a distant memory this morning as hillary unleashed a scathing and puzzling attack on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 video of the incident is here _meta_end_dot_

 a visibly angry hillary made the following comments hillary was complaining about mailers from the obama campaign regarding her health care plan _meta_end_dot_

 i said earlier her attack this morning is puzzling and it is _meta_end_dot_

 for one let s talk about timing _meta_end_dot_

 there mailers have been out for quite a while now and yet hillary woke up this morning and was suddenly and spontaneously filled with outrage about them _meta_end_question_

 second let s talk about the content _meta_end_dot_

 a core part of her campaign has been that she is the tested candidate _meta_end_dot_

 that she has weathered decades of republican attacks that she is tried and tested in campaigns and that she is the toughest candidate to go up against the republican machine in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 against that backdrop of i can take whatever is thrown at me her complaints this morning about how unfair obama s campaign tactics are ring a bit hollow _meta_end_dot_

 but more disturbing is exactly what hillary said _meta_end_dot_

 leaving aside claims of republican trickery the most telling part of her speech was when she seemingly claimed that obama has no right to attack her on health care _meta_end_dot_

 since when is a candidate s position on a given issue off limits _meta_end_question_

 since when can a candidate claim that because i put forth position x you can t debate me on that position _meta_end_question_

 of course hillary s point is that because obama hasn t put forth a universal health care plan he can t criticize it or ask how her plan will be enforced _meta_end_dot_

 but even this too is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed it has all become absurd hasn t it _meta_end_question_

 clearly the clinton camp has chosen to ride the mark penn strategy of negativity straight through texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 so we get a fiery hillary chastising obama shame on you barack obama and challenging him to meet me in ohio as if we were in the middle of a grade school fight instead of a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 welcome to the height of silly season folks _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be a wild ride _meta_end_dot_
