  it s been a while since we did this _meta_end_dot_

 like since august _meta_end_dot_

 and the race has developed quite a bit since then _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen romney consolidate his gains in the early states but start to face serious erosion as huckabee emerged as the conservative champion that we a lefty rabble had all foreseen way back in december _meta_number_ref_ when the bigfoot pundits and republican base were tossing him in the brownnback tancredo goodwill box of reject vanity candidates _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well shit _meta_end_dot_

 what have we seen fred actually do _meta_end_question_

 he s like the komodo dragon at the zoo _meta_end_dot_

 he sounds bad ass but when you finally see him in action he s this wrinkly leathery creature that just wants to lie out in the sun and loll about waiting for the early bird special _meta_end_dot_

 the only difference is that the dragon actually mauls the bird to death itself _meta_end_dot_

 mauling requires a bit too much exertion for grandpa fred _meta_end_dot_

 in any event we ve seen thompson go from the savior of the base conservatives to an utter non factor just as we re now seeing sex on the city and the concomitant and unceasing revelations of sustained sleaze sink rudy s career _meta_end_dot_

 and we ve seen john mccain written off by so many this summer circle around the field like a vulture over a hyena lion hippo battle royale ready to gobble up any of the seemingly more dangerous creatures should they fall _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always thought of the primary race as being a lot like competitive sailing _meta_end_dot_

 it s admittedly an incredibly bourgie analogy but bear with me _meta_end_dot_

 first the game takes a lot of money it s lousy with white men and it s boring for anyone other than obsessives to watch _meta_end_dot_

 rimshot but the real similarity lies in the race before the race _meta_end_dot_

 in both sailing and in the primary campaign the contestants pretty much know whether they ve got a shot to win as soon as the starting gun is fired or as soon as the first caucus opens its doors _meta_end_dot_

 in sailing you see the prestart period the time before the race begins when the boats jockey for position behind the starting line is where many a race is won or lost _meta_end_dot_

 it really doesn t matter how well you sail once the gun is sounded for if you haven t positioned yourself so that you re the boat on the correct end of the line the boat with the best angle and the boat cruising at full speed at the start more often than not you re done like tommy thompson _meta_end_dot_

 and the same is true in primary racing _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter how good you look in august or even at thanksgiving just ask president dean _meta_end_dot_

 you need to be the candidate who hits iowa on the favored tack blowing by once favored opponents and halfway to the new hampshire buoy before the other guys know that they ve lost _meta_end_dot_

 i said it was a bourgie analogy _meta_end_dot_

 but it s appropriate this is a republican cattle call _meta_end_dot_

 and today less than a month before go time i can t help but feel that mccain and huckabee respectively the candidate i thought most likely to win and the candidate that my gut told me would win way back when i wrote my first cattle call a year ago are the two skippers best positioned to steer their campaigns to hot starts leaving their proud competitors in their wake _meta_end_dot_

 but the rules are such that i rank them as i feel they d do if the start was today no next month _meta_end_dot_

 so here you are _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_end_dot_

 he s still effectively tied in iowa and is topping the polls in new hampshire which means that he s the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 and the mormon speech may end up helping him _meta_end_dot_

 but huck is all over him in iowa and no one has any real idea of how crazy independent nh would pan out should romney lose in the caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 being the frontrunner comes with its own challenges and romney s biggest one is that a loss in iowa could send him into freefall _meta_end_dot_

 that said if he holds on in iowa he probably wins new hampshire and rudy won t be around to stop him in cali and ny _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t think he ll manage to hold on in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 even i had given up on him in august and it s still amazing to me that he s come so far without any money _meta_end_dot_

 i mean he raised something like _meta_dollor_ref_ million between last fall and the end of _meta_number_ref_q _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but he s finally living up to the potential that so many kossacks saw in him for so long and that s kind of scary _meta_end_dot_

 now we ll get to see if he can stand up to real scrutiny and you gotta believe that the dumond thing could really hurt him _meta_end_dot_

 i actually think that he s less likely to win than mccain whom i m starting to see as the fortinbras poised to seize the crown after mitt and huck kill each other but it s been entertaining watching him make a very improbable run to the top _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the sad thing is that my assessment was probably the kindest that a desperate mccain camp could have dug up during what was truly a miserable summer _meta_end_dot_

 the erstwhile frontrunner was left for dead by just about everyone but someone forgot to tell mccain that he was supposed to give up _meta_end_dot_

 he took a scythe to his famously bloated staff and began running a lean mean positive campaign _meta_end_dot_

 candidates who were no longer afraid of him began to talk about how he d be their favored candidate were they not running _meta_end_dot_

 the immigration bill that had torpedoed his campaign faded into memory as the frontrunners began to ape tancredo and sound increasingly paranoid on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 and his poll numbers never did slide completely off the table and so here we are with mccain climbing back into a tie for second in nh and romney in danger of collapse at the hands of huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 get ready to be surprised _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 he s done _meta_end_dot_

 sex on the city is just going to keep getting worse and worse and he s flailing about looking for a way out _meta_end_dot_

 there isn t one _meta_end_dot_

 he s trending down in both iowa and new hampshire which is a pretty good sign to me that it s over _meta_end_dot_

 everyone else paul could conceivably take second in nh but that s about the best he can hope for _meta_end_dot_

 in future years the fred thompson campaign will be studied by insomniac political scientists who will find the sweet succor of sleep in its somnolent mysteries _meta_end_dot_
