  at first it seems like an admission of guilt _meta_end_dot_

 and shame _meta_end_dot_

 cia agent john kiriakou steps forward on abc saying that the us has used waterboarding and that waterboarding is torture _meta_end_dot_

 kiriakou presented his story with a lot of aww shucks we re better than that and white house press conferences were temporarily enlivened by attempts to get dana perino to confirm the use of waterboarding _meta_end_dot_

 but there was another message delivered in kiriakou s confession that message is torture works _meta_end_dot_

 the story advanced by kiriakou might not be quite so neat as the scenarios put forward on _meta_number_ref_ but it s very close _meta_end_dot_

 tough al qaeda leader refuses to give any information to interrogators _meta_end_dot_

 then after mere seconds of exposure to waterboarding said bad guy is forever broken _meta_end_dot_

 he becomes a motormouth spewing forth literally hours of details on dozens of upcoming attacks _meta_end_dot_

 that information isn t just gibberish but real data that saves real people including halting an attaack against a school _meta_end_dot_

 kiriakou unable to look the camera directly in its glassy eye then concludes that shameful as the torture was not torturing would have been worse _meta_end_dot_

 besides says kiriakou we only waterboarded two people _meta_end_dot_

 both of them very bad guys _meta_end_dot_

 in kiriakou s story torture becomes safe effective and rare _meta_end_dot_

 and the media swallowed _meta_end_dot_

 hook line and sinker _meta_end_dot_

 funny thing though specifics on those many dozens in some interviews of incidents that were halted from this spew of accurate information gleaned from torture are more than a little lacking _meta_end_dot_

 that school that was saved was british in one account _meta_end_dot_

 american in another _meta_end_dot_

 the hours of details that were taped were among those tapes conveniently destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 the information provided so vague that neither its source nor its effect can be tested _meta_end_dot_

 if kiriakou is confident that torture produced accurate information and he s willing to explain exactly who was tortured along with when where and how they were tortured _meta_end_dot_

 why does he not provide the specifics of the disrupted operations _meta_end_question_

 these supposed operations already squelched and our sad eyed cia torturer has already revealed source of the information _meta_end_dot_

 those very long and very boring conversations that kiriakou waves off in interviews is exactly the kind of evidence that would be _meta_end_dot_

 well any evidence at all that kiriakou is telling the truth _meta_end_dot_

 larry johnson has already expressed his doubt that kiriakou is telling the truth _meta_end_dot_

 with more than the ten minutes of consideration apparently applied by abc it s hard to see kiriakou s story as anything but an attempt to redeem the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture as effective means of interrogation _meta_end_dot_

 after all say torture supporters why would people keep using torture if it doesn t work _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because it s satisfying that s why _meta_end_dot_

 because when you have someone who you think is a bad guy in front of you someone you think is scum you don t want to befriend them _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to feed them and give them some damn mat to pray on _meta_end_dot_

 you want to hurt them _meta_end_dot_

 and then hurt them some more _meta_end_dot_

 people want torture to be effective for the same reason that people endlessly sift statistics for some sign that capital punishment is effective _meta_end_dot_

 because vengeance is fun _meta_end_dot_

 kiriakou comes like santa bringing all the little pro torture boys and girls an excuse to get out the whips and electrodes _meta_end_dot_
