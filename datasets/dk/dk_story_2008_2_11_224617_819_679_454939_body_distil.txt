  there are at least two stories here _meta_end_dot_

 first there s the desire to get down to the business of running against the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 as i read the article i thought back to another nyt article from last week where howard dean was quoted as saying he thought we would have a nominee in march or april _meta_end_dot_

 as i previously explained mathematically it s highly unlikely we will have a nominee before the convention _meta_end_dot_

 clinton would probably have to drop out immediately after march _meta_number_ref_th in order for obama to collect _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama does sweep tomorrow s contests and next tuesday wins hawaii as expected and holds off clinton wisconsin then it s not inconceivable that the pressure on clinton to drop out will become tremendous if she doesn t win both texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 even if one of the candidates doesn t have the full number of pledged delegates to close the deal before the convention it s possible that democrats could decide on a de facto presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 most of the campaign infrastructure officially through the various party organs like the dnc and the state parties as well as the unofficial operations like the _meta_number_ref_ s will remain inoperable until we have a nominee _meta_end_dot_

 we ll be able to muster up some attacks on mccain assuming they ever finish counting the ballots in washington and he does end up their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but coordinated campaigns the dnc campaign operation and the flow of money from mega donors and institutional players like organized labor all await a presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i take the willingness of these superdelegates to speak but not be named as indicative of something many of us have thought for some time about clinton s establishment support it s much more shallow than many realized _meta_end_dot_

 certainly there are many many supporters and allies of hillary clinton who are rabid in their devotion to her _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has a reputation of steely ruthlessness toward those who cross her _meta_end_dot_

 what gets less attention is her reputation of intense loyalty to those whom she believes have been loyal and helpful to her _meta_end_dot_

 one can argue that it s self serving but the line between sincere and self serving in politics is often hard to discern _meta_end_dot_

 however many of clinton s early endorsements appeared to be self serving on the part of the endorsee _meta_end_dot_

 i never accepted the inevitability of clinton s nomination but many did and those who endorsed clinton early must include many who felt that they helped themselves more by being on board early with the eventual nominee _meta_end_dot_

 their motivations for endorsing her were shallow and hence they are not strongly committed to staying with her if she doesn t appear likely to get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it s too early however to be talking of the clinton campaign in the past tense _meta_end_dot_

 she could win both texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is if the vote was held today she d win both comfortably _meta_end_dot_

 but the pattern through most of the contests has been clinton losing huge leads the closer it is to the election and either winning with more modest wins that the polls suggested some weeks out or seeing her lead vanish and obama taking the state _meta_end_dot_

 if he does manage to sweep the contests tomorrow and nest tuesday he will have two weeks to concentrate almost exclusively on the march _meta_number_ref_th states which also include vermont and rhode island _meta_end_dot_

 this will be the real test of whether more time in front of the voters gives obama enough power to overcome clinton s relative strength with latinos and working class white voters _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton wins texas and ohio she can legitimately claim to still be a strong viable candidate provided she can avoid going broke _meta_end_dot_

 if she loses one or both states look for tremendous pressure for her to concede the nomination to obama _meta_end_dot_
