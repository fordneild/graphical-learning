  from jay rockefeller s wapo op ed of october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as the congress reconvenes next week the fisa bill will surely be back in rockefeller s sights _meta_end_dot_

 but has anyone ever asked why if this was so critical to national security the senate intelligence committee only got around to dealing with telecom amnesty over the past year _meta_end_question_

 the bush administration has been operating this illegal program since at least _meta_number_ref_ by some accounts since even before september _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 they were found out and exposed in december of _meta_number_ref_ and lawsuits were filed almost immediately _meta_end_dot_

 how is it that this amnesty or bust white knuckle death match has only developed in late _meta_number_ref_ and spilled over into early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_
