  a few days ago i wrote a brief primer on campaign finance issues with an example of bad reporting about campaign contributions _meta_end_dot_

 today we ll look at the other side of campaign finance the spending side with an example of poor reporting about how a campaign spends money and bad conclusions that locate the racket in the wrong place _meta_end_dot_

 from salon the article does go on to acknowledge that the payments were mostly made not to penn personally but to his firm penn schoen berland which is a subsidiary of the pr giant burson marsteller _meta_end_dot_

 but how does the author get to the conclusion that penn is personally making a ton of money off the clinton campaign _meta_end_question_

 or that the money being paid to penn schoen berland is necessarily an example of runaway consultant costs _meta_end_question_

 there are two big problems with this article and others like it _meta_end_dot_

 first it perpetuates confusion about campaign costs _meta_end_dot_

 like most articles about campaign spending it doesn t try to figure out what share of the payments to consultants includes the print costs _meta_end_dot_

 the reporter apparently didn t discuss whether the clinton campaign made cash transfers to the united states postal service for postage or if penn schoen paid the printing and postage of the mail pieces and if that s a big part of the payment to the consultants _meta_end_dot_

 there s no discussion about how much the tv stations in altoona and harrisburg are charging to run a _meta_number_ref_ second campaign ad _meta_end_dot_

 payments to a call center with professional phone surveyors for completing _meta_number_ref_ surveys that lasted an average of _meta_number_ref_ minutes each aren t mentioned presumably because it didn t occur to the reporter that call center costs are a big piece of the cost of a poll _meta_end_dot_

 reporters also seldom ask why campaigns have gotten more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 campaigns costs have gone up less because of consultant fees and more because it costs more to communicate with voters and the number of voters they must reach keeps growing _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ there were approximately _meta_number_ref_ million people in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ census counted over _meta_number_ref_ million people _meta_end_dot_

 the number of congressional seats hasn t changed during that time so that means the average constituency for a member of congress has grown from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tv has gotten much more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 postage rates have gone way up _meta_end_dot_

 the cost of reaching voters is much much greater than it was just _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 do some consultants screw over their clients _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 but most don t because most want to win _meta_end_dot_

 besides over a career you make a lot more money by having a client win and then retain you at a lower profit margin but for numerous cycles than you do raping some sap who might have won had the consultant not sucked out too much money for herself _meta_end_dot_

 as with everything else candidates should be wary of anyone trying to separate them from their money _meta_end_dot_

 if they can t manage the finances of their campaign it raises doubts about their suitability for managing the public purse _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore most political consultants don t make big money _meta_end_dot_

 most love politics and figure out a way to make a comfortable middle class living doing something they like and are as fiercely partisan as any of us at daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 most aren t like mark penn either in their politics or in their business practices _meta_end_dot_

 and for the mark penns of political consulting and i m no fan of the guy as would be clear to anyone who reads this the problem isn t the money they take from the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s that they screw up our politics because they infect campaigns with the biases of their corporate clients _meta_end_dot_

 mark penn has only one political client hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he s not dropping millions and millions in to his home in georgetown because of what he makes from the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 no he s using the clinton campaign to drum up business from the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 during the second clinton administration the justice department sued microsoft for anti trust violations but at the same time penn then the president s pollster was also working for microsoft _meta_end_dot_

 if there was a political advantage to be had by emphasizing the microsoft case would an adviser also getting paid by microsoft make the suggestion _meta_end_question_

 would the thought even occur to her _meta_end_question_

 most political consultants do work for non candidate groups but it s often interests groups like environmental organizations or labor unions or groups working around some public interest issues like children s health or public transit or the need for greater funding for education _meta_end_dot_

 but some work with lots of corporate clients trade associations and foreign governments _meta_end_dot_

 penn for instance has worked for the tobacco industry _meta_end_dot_

 he s worked for union busting firms _meta_end_dot_

 and we know from the last few days that he s worked for the government of colombia which doesn t seem to care when colombian labor unionists get murdered _meta_end_dot_

 when someone spends most of their time working for clients who will have a conflict of interest with their political clients and who works for some odious causes won t that influence the advice their give to candidates and office holders _meta_end_question_

 i d love to see reporters spend more time asking those questions instead of conveying the impression that most or all fees paid to consultant go directly in to the consultant s pocket _meta_end_dot_
