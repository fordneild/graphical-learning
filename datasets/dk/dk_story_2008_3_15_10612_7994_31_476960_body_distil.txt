  the good news top dem brass sent letters of support to our three south florida candidates annette taddeo joe garcia raul martinez who are each offering stiff challenges to incumbent republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news the dccc seems to think that this is an adequate response to our complaints and those of local democrats _meta_end_dot_

 here s why we still have a host of problems i don t think it s too much to ask that the chair of the red to blue program be a partisan bulldog at all times _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the job calls for _meta_end_dot_

 if debbie wasserman schultz can t or doesn t want to perform these sorts of duties then she needs to be relieved of her position _meta_end_dot_

 but on a broader level the dccc cannot accept these sort of faint hearted recusals by anyone _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough to say well if x won t help out we ll send y instead this is a team and every member of the caucus has to play _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel fought bitterly against the but i don t wanna crowd and with good reason _meta_end_dot_

 toleration of this special pleading is one reason we spent twelve years in the wilderness rahm s battle against it is a reason we finally took back the majority last election _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i m glad that pelosi rahm and van hollen have all affirmed their support for our south florida trio _meta_end_dot_

 but i expect more from the dccc and our caucus _meta_end_dot_
