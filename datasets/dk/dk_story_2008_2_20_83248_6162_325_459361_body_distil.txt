 conservative social issue deathwatch continues i could probably count on two hands and maybe one foot the one with eight toes the hours of reality tv i ve watched not including campaign coverage which i categorize more as a fantasy series dominated by not so magical pundit elves _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt it s compelling in a voyeuristic way but i ve never had the time or the inclination to invest the hours needed to follow the exploits of all the scavenger hunters castaways teenage rebels and wannabe brides supermodels metrosexuals crooners restaurateurs entrepreneurs and trumpbots _meta_end_dot_

 besides with all the surveillance going on each of us is already part of one big not so happy reality show _meta_end_dot_
