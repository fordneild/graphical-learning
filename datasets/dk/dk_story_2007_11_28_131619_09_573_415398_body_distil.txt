  sen _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd has now become the second democrat in the field to apply for and be declared eligible to receive public matching funds for his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign has yet to make a decision as to whether to accept such funds but he will have to decide this week in order to be able to receive funds as part of the january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ initial disbursement and accept the resulting overall expenditure caps _meta_end_dot_

 as to how much will be available here goes you can only be matched up to _meta_dollor_ref_ per contributor and he can only be matched with regards to the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m raised for the presidential bid as of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and not for the _meta_dollor_ref_m transferred over from his senate account at the start of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 of that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m it s particularly top heavy _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m of it stems from contributors at _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so working down the chart the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_dollor_ref_ contributions yields about _meta_dollor_ref_k in matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 if you assumed each person in the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ bracket gave _meta_dollor_ref_ that would yield another _meta_dollor_ref_k or so _meta_end_dot_

 overall therefore we re looking at somewhere between _meta_dollor_ref_m _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m in matching funds plus whatever he raised that s matchable during these past two months but not yet reported to the fec _meta_end_dot_

 should he opt in _meta_end_question_

 i d have to predict he will _meta_end_dot_

 dodd enters this quarter with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m cash on hand having raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m and spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m during the previous quarter _meta_end_dot_

 unless there has been a serious uptick in his fundraising his campaign simply cannot sustain this burn rate much longer _meta_end_dot_

 they ve cut some staff and focused on iowa but dodd may have no choice but to go all in in iowa using these funds fight for a miracle and then hope for a fundraising windfall with further matching to follow _meta_end_dot_
