  dear senator clinton you don t know me from a hole in the wall _meta_end_dot_

 so given the demands on your time there s zero reason for you to read what i m going to say _meta_end_dot_

 i m just a lowly blogger _meta_end_dot_

 and criminy not even on my own blog _meta_end_dot_

 a voice buried in terabytes of digitized chatter _meta_end_dot_

 a life long rank and file democrat who worked a couple of congressional campaigns ages ago contributes a few dollars to a few candidates and walks precincts every election _meta_end_dot_

 not a superdelegate _meta_end_dot_

 not a pledged delegate _meta_end_dot_

 not somebody with party clout or deep pockets or even the ear of anyone with clout or deep pockets _meta_end_dot_

 as i said no reason you should know or listen to me _meta_end_dot_

 i have met and spoken briefly with your husband in various venues several times before and after he became president but you and i have never even shaken hands _meta_end_dot_

 i attended a rally for you in los angeles february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wanted to see you do the stump speech live _meta_end_dot_

 feel the vibe of the crowd _meta_end_dot_

 you said some good things _meta_end_dot_

 many good things in fact _meta_end_dot_

 stuff i agree with _meta_end_dot_

 stuff i really agree with _meta_end_dot_

 several times i applauded _meta_end_dot_

 got carried away and whistled in appreciation twice _meta_end_dot_

 you also said some stuff i disagree with _meta_end_dot_

 intensely _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise _meta_end_dot_

 we re democrats after all which covers a lot of ideological ground and a lot of screaming _meta_end_dot_

 it s always been that way _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not writing to discuss ideology _meta_end_dot_

 nor complain about campaign tactics _meta_end_dot_

 why bore you _meta_end_question_

 anything that hasn t already been said _meta_number_ref_ zillion times by smarter more experienced and tuned in people than i on all sides of that subject definitely isn t worth saying _meta_end_dot_

 rather i m writing to ask you to plead with you to admit to yourself what is clear to nearly everyone who is closely following this contest your chances of getting the nomination are slim _meta_end_dot_

 your chances of getting the nomination in a way that can heal the party for the unified run we need to win in november are nil _meta_end_dot_

 and every day you continue to pursue the nomination is another day for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i confess _meta_end_dot_

 even though he was not my first choice i have publicly supported barack obama since february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and he says you should stay in the running as long as you wish _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of several things he and i disagree about although he for all the obvious reasons can t be making the pitch that you should suspend your campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i assure you senator that if your chances for getting the nomination were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or even _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i d not be pleading with you like this _meta_end_dot_

 i d say to myself too bad this drawn out fight may cost us democrats might even have us fighting in denver so all the delighted megamedia can broadcast our disarray and make ignorant comparisons to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but i wouldn t be urging you to step aside _meta_end_dot_

 and if the situation were reversed if senator obama had next to no chance of winning the nomination if he were dragging out the inevitable to no good purpose i wouldn t be writing to you _meta_end_dot_

 that isn t how things are however _meta_end_dot_

 you ve fought hard _meta_end_dot_

 but you ve lost _meta_end_dot_

 acknowledging that accepting it and acting graciously and selflessly on it right now would mean the democrats your supporters and the supporters of other candidates who have already left the contest could unite behind barack obama without further delay _meta_end_dot_

 it would mean we could get on with the process of regaining the white house and dealing with the problems this nation has avoided for decades _meta_end_dot_

 every day you continue is a day for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 you know and i know senator that we cannot afford another four years or eight years of the lawless bigoted constitution dismantling war mongering economy wrecking environment smashing health ignoring republican party running the white house as if the founders never put their ideas on parchment as if due process were some extra terrestrial concept as if the roman empire were an apt model for foreign and domestic policy _meta_end_dot_

 for the sake of your daughter chelsea and my daughter amira who like you and me are less than a year apart we can t stand any more rapacious reckless smirking gop governance _meta_end_dot_

 poll after poll indicates that the majority of americans agree with us _meta_end_dot_

 scuttlebutt has it that you believe barack obama cannot win in november _meta_end_dot_

 so i can understand why you d maybe want to respond to my plea with an are you kidding or something stronger perhaps some inquiry as to how i can possibly be so na ve after all this time _meta_end_dot_

 you may be right _meta_end_dot_

 for a variety of reasons senator obama may not be able to win _meta_end_dot_

 he may stumble on his own the right wing smear machine abetted by the media may trip him up left over acrimony from within the democratic party itself may be his undoing the votes of racists may be just enough to tip the scales unfavorably _meta_end_dot_

 who can say _meta_end_question_

 i m certainly not one who ll suggest he s going to ride a magic carpet to november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but you know all those vulnerabilities except race are yours as well and you ve got misogyny against you _meta_end_dot_

 in other words in the general election a toss up _meta_end_dot_

 it s no toss up in the nomination process _meta_end_dot_

 you know it _meta_end_dot_

 your campaign team knows it _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign contributors seem to know it _meta_end_dot_

 it s over _meta_end_dot_

 well of course it s not over until you say it s over _meta_end_dot_

 or i wouldn t be writing to you _meta_end_dot_

 every day you don t say it s over is a day for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 historically much of the screaming within the democratic party has been about how people of color and women are treated in america _meta_end_dot_

 how the party has treated them _meta_end_dot_

 over time that treatment by both party and country has improved although as you and i know from personal experience aspects of the dream of equality and fairness remain unfulfilled for both women and minorities _meta_end_dot_

 we ve come a long way but there is a long way to go _meta_end_dot_

 which is why this campaign for the presidential nomination has riled me so much _meta_end_dot_

 many democratic partisans in this contest have behaved as if you and senator obama are affirmative action candidates _meta_end_dot_

 you know what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 it can be found everywhere in america _meta_end_dot_

 the buzz in the department which says she didn t really deserve the promotion _meta_end_dot_

 the office whisper of if he was white he d never been hired but the bar was lowered for him _meta_end_dot_

 affirmative action defined as not good enough _meta_end_dot_

 attitudes of racial and male supremacy often but not always intermixed with one another and these days fading and usually far more concealed in code than _meta_number_ref_ years ago when you and i came from two sides of the political spectrum in support of antiwar candidate gene mccarthy have sadly been widely expressed during this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that s to be expected from the chris matthewses and rush limbaughs and sean hannitys _meta_end_dot_

 they and a bunch of their mimickers are stupid shits pardon my french playing with hate speech and bigotry for dollars _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately as you well know not all the racism and sexism injected into the campaign has come from the night riders of broadcast bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 highly respected people have done some ugly things and said far worse _meta_end_dot_

 the foulness of a portion of what s been said on progressive blogs including this blog and the support from people who don t say anything but approve of the foul things being said by others are shameful and infuriating _meta_end_dot_

 clearly some of this rancid stuff originates with right wing partisans thriving on and spurring our division _meta_end_dot_

 but some self identified progressives have joined the chorus _meta_end_dot_

 the language used against you as well as intolerable attitudes expressed less obscenely prove misogyny is alive and unhealthy _meta_end_dot_

 as is the stubborn denial that some of these attitudes even count for misogyny _meta_end_dot_

 the same way some deny that the racism we ve seen on display during the campaign covertly or otherwise amounts to racism _meta_end_dot_

 absolutely unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 not merely affronts to you and senator obama but to every woman and every person of color _meta_end_dot_

 and every thinking progressive of whichever sex or ethnicity _meta_end_dot_

 for this rotten public discourse many people owe you apologies _meta_end_dot_

 as they do your rival _meta_end_dot_

 i ll make my own _meta_end_dot_

 although i have repeatedly challenged some of the slurs and scurrilous attitudes i ve seen expressed i ve failed to do so diligently and i ve let things slide that shouldn t have _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry about that _meta_end_dot_

 you deserved better _meta_end_dot_

 as did those who were also demeaned by the sexist slurs against you _meta_end_dot_

 just to be completely clear at a time when so many have said they ve been misinterpreted and misquoted and misapprehended _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying all the criticism of you or senator obama or any of the other candidates has been out of bounds _meta_end_dot_

 much of it has hit the bullseye _meta_end_dot_

 particularly in the arena of foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 if the campaign discourse had avoided the foul and stuck with legitimate criticisms who knows if the accumulated voting results we re now faced with would be the same _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have a time machine so we can never know _meta_end_dot_

 we are where we are and can only work to reduce such putrescence now and in future contests _meta_end_dot_

 and where we are is caught in an unresolved contest whose ultimate results four weeks or four months from now are all but inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 as a fellow blogger by the name of kid oakland wrote in a most excellent essay a few days ago senator right now is a clinton moment _meta_end_dot_

 right now you can have an instantaneously positive impact on the coming general election that will never again be as powerful _meta_end_dot_

 you can seize the moment today tomorrow early next week and give the democratic nominee an edge in november _meta_end_dot_

 or you can hang in there and hamstring us _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 acknowledge what you know to be so _meta_end_dot_

 every day you wait is a day for john mccain _meta_end_dot_
