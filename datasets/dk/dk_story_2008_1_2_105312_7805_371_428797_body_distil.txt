  no matter which poll you read there s little doubt that the race in iowa is very close _meta_end_dot_

 factors like the weather and the effectiveness of operations designed to get more voters to the polls everything from free snow shoveling to babysitting may help determine who comes out of iowa with the momentum of a win and which candidate has to defend a third place showing _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a candidate not usually mentioned in news stories about tomorrow s caucuses who may be the most important man in iowa at the moment bill richardson _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ dennis kucinich told his supporters that in areas where he did not reach the _meta_percent_ref_ minimum they should support john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 this year he s already sent out word for his troops to fall in behind obama _meta_end_dot_

 looking back at the polls for _meta_number_ref_ kucinich had _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ support across the state _meta_end_dot_

 both kerry and edwards received more votes than entrance polls indicated as caucus goers were forced to move from first choices that didn t make the grade _meta_end_dot_

 however while kerry went up around two and a half percent edwards gained almost six percent between the time people went in the door and when they came out _meta_end_dot_

 a good part of that came from the organized movement out of the kucinich camp _meta_end_dot_

 depending on the poll bill richardson currently has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ support in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 if he were to ask his followers to line up behind any of the three candidates at the top of the polls it could easily vault that campaign ahead of competitors _meta_end_dot_

 as of yesterday richardson is still promising to shock the world with a strong finish in iowa but even if his support reached the top of the numbers indicated in the polls it s not clear that a fourth place finish would give any reason for voters elsewhere to look his way _meta_end_dot_

 right now richardson may be in the best position he will be in for the rest of the campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 not in terms of winning but in terms of extracting any deal he might want from another campaign _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of state richardson _meta_end_question_

 un ambassador _meta_end_question_

 heck why not vice president richardson _meta_end_question_

 bill richardson may not be at the top of the polls in iowa but there may not be any one person who at this point could have as much influence over the outcome _meta_end_dot_
