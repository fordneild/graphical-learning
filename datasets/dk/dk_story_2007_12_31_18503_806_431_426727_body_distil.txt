  ron paul says some of his best friends are black _meta_end_dot_

 first of all more than any other republican candidate is probably the lowest bar ever set _meta_end_dot_

 second of all do they know about his history of racism _meta_end_question_

 hilariously some paulbots are claiming that the ron paul political report wasn t written or edited by well ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 that the piece in question was written by a staffer _meta_end_dot_

 if so was a retraction printed in a subsequent edition of the newsletter _meta_end_question_

 if not the excuse doesn t fly third of all while he s clamped down his overt racism it s still bubbling near the surface and follow this link for a full evisceration of these ridiculous and very much fringe views _meta_end_dot_

 finally given the comments and emails from the paulbots i m led to believe that they support ron paul for one reason and one reason only because he opposes the war and american imperialism _meta_end_dot_

 well if that s the case why don t these people support dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 true i don t think much of dennis but at least his anti war creds aren t sullied by noxious views on any number of other issues _meta_end_dot_

 update oh another point since some paul supporters seem to think that ron paul is blameless in all the problems foisted on us by the gop majorities this past decade and somehow he s the only one that can fix things ron paul enabled the gop congress voting for tom delay as majority leader during the delay era _meta_end_dot_

 he could ve quit the gop and gone independent or libertarian but instead he choose to cast his lot with the warmongering and free spending republicans _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ he received from delay s armpac was enough to buy his loyalty _meta_end_question_
