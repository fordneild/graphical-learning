  when women who consider themselves feminists read a load of crap like this from the new york chapter of now we feel betrayed yuck _meta_end_dot_

 just yuck _meta_end_dot_

 i could ve sworn we d dumped the notion of sticking up for men when we didn t think they deserved it _meta_end_dot_

 or shutting our mouths when we disagreed with them _meta_end_dot_

 or burying our anger if they compromised on issues important to us _meta_end_dot_

 if new york now members kept quiet about kennedy s stands until yesterday and were always waiting in the wings i think they ve missed an important stop or two on the equality express _meta_end_dot_

 the press release only gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 with the bonus of exclamation points _meta_end_exclamation_

 shrieky non professional press release _meta_end_exclamation_

 using junior high girl dumped by her boyfriend for new girl in town framing _meta_end_exclamation_

 and guilt tripping too _meta_end_exclamation_

 terrific example of politically savvy empowerment women _meta_end_exclamation_

 thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 way to get fellow power brokers to take female voices seriously _meta_end_exclamation_

 yes _meta_end_exclamation_

 progressive white men who happen to think a different candidate is preferable for president are the oppressors _meta_end_exclamation_

 nobody can build coalitions like ny now _meta_end_exclamation_

 as an aside i assume only white men are oppressive if they don t want hillary for president _meta_end_dot_

 because african american males who support obama because he s one of them well _meta_end_dot_

 that s natural _meta_end_dot_

 but white males who support edwards _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 never mind _meta_end_dot_

 my head hurts this sophomoric whine is exhibit _meta_number_ref_ in the ineffectiveness of chip on the shoulder identity politics _meta_end_dot_

 and when polls show that while a vast majority of women believe the women s movement has been of benefit to themselves and this country and yet fewer than a quarter are willing to identify themselves as feminists something s gone terribly wrong with the public face of the movement _meta_end_dot_

 this press release shows why _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to be associated with the authors either _meta_end_dot_

 thanks new york now for crystallizing in one short document pretty much every shallow stereotype about women s libbers that s been bandied about for half a century _meta_end_dot_

 you didn t just piss off the white progressive men you attacked _meta_end_dot_

 you pissed off a lot of women as well _meta_end_dot_

 as evidenced by most of the commentary in indianademocrat s diary that first brought the issue up _meta_end_dot_
