  from the diaries barbinmd over the weekend senator evan bayh suggested we measure the success of the candidates not by delegates earned but by the electoral votes of the states they ve won _meta_end_dot_

 in the spirit of senator bayh i present you with five additional metrics that i pulled out of my ass _meta_end_dot_

 as you ll see hillary clinton is either winning or tied with obama in every case _meta_end_dot_

 i should say at the outset that this study is highly scientific and my methods are rigorous _meta_end_dot_

 except where otherwise noted the data for this study is available here _meta_end_dot_

 i have excluded american samoa guam puerto rico the virgin islands and democrats voting abroad because their inclusion would be un american _meta_end_dot_

 similarly i have excluded the district of columbia which isn t even a state _meta_end_dot_

 total number of yellow states on wikipedia s map of the united states clinton _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ by barack obama s own admission at the conclusion of his iowa address he noted we are not a collection of red states and blue states he failed however to specifically identify the colors that should be assigned to the states _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone is to resolve this question it is wikipedia the repository of all human knowledge which makes clear that we are a nation of green yellow red and pink states _meta_end_dot_

 it s important of course that this study be conducted in a fair and nonarbitrary fashion so i determined the color metric yellow by eliminating the states least frequently associated with submarines in beatles songs _meta_end_dot_

 this yields a slight advantage to hillary clinton _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 total number of commonwealths clinton _meta_number_ref_ massachusetts obama _meta_number_ref_ virginia here the race is neck and neck but clinton is expected to take pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 as there are only four commonwealths total it is virtually impossible for obama to beat clinton on the commonwealth count _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton beats obama in kentucky his claim that he has won more states will be canceled out by her claim that she has won more commonwealths _meta_end_dot_

 total number of new states clinton _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ hilllary clinton has won new hampshire new jersey new mexico and new york _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast obama has failed to win a single state with the word new in its name _meta_end_dot_

 obama s failure among self proclaimed new states raises serious questions about his supposed strength among young voters new people and his supposed message of change new policies _meta_end_dot_

 average highest elevation clinton _meta_number_ref_ feet obama _meta_number_ref_ feet frankly i m surprised that more attention hasn t been drawn to this _meta_end_dot_

 obama claims to want to elevate the level of discourse but he has failed in states with the highest elevations _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has won on mount whitney california humphreys peak arizona boundary peak nevada and wheeler peak new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps more significantly there are so few peaks left that despite the close margins obama has no hope of regaining the altitude vote _meta_end_dot_

 clinton also leads among states with the highest average mean elevation clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet _meta_end_dot_

 average official state mixed drink clinton wine milk coffee cranberry juice orange juice tomato juice obama kool aid beer conecuh ridge whiskey milk moxie south carolina grown tea it s a close call but on balance clinton has the better tasting official state mixed drink _meta_end_dot_

 here s how this is tabulated most states have an official state beverage wikipedia state beverage list _meta_end_dot_

 using equal parts of each state beverage from each state that each candidate won i was able to produce two mixed drinks _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to go into the judging details except to say that obama s combination of whiskey and kool aid left me questioning whether his coalition of voters can hold together beyond the late night taco bell run _meta_end_dot_

 conclusion it s clear that the time has come for obama to drop out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 by almost any measure imaginable excluding delegates popular vote primaries or caucuses clinton is leading _meta_end_dot_
