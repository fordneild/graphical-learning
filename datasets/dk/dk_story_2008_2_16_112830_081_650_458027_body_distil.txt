  the day of the florida primary i wrote about john mccain s financial dilemma mccain never spent any money borrowed by using his certification for federal matching funds as collateral _meta_end_dot_

 however he may have committed himself to the spending caps which would be disastrous for his campaign by promising to enter the federal matching funds program in order to secure a _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan he ended up not using think of it like this _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain secured a personal loan by using his home as collateral _meta_end_dot_

 he requested more money be added to the loan but the bank said it was more than he had collateral to pay back _meta_end_dot_

 mccain countered by telling the bank that his neighbor failed to salt his icy sidewalk and mccain slipped on it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain got a doctor to say the slip and fall hurt mccain s back he sued the neighbor and he expects to win a big settlement _meta_end_dot_

 the bank said sure ok that s what happens if you win your court case _meta_end_dot_

 but what if you lose in response mccain said oh i suppose i ll have to get a job and the bank then said oh ok that s good enough for us and authorized the loan _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain used the certification for matching funds as collateral he would have definitely been locked in to the matching funds scheme including the spending caps _meta_end_dot_

 what happened here is that the bank didn t require him to offer up the certificate as collateral _meta_end_dot_

 the bank simply accepted mccain s word that he had it and would enter the federal system if necessary and the bank took him at his word _meta_end_dot_

 the question that needs to be answered is whether this sweetheart deal with the bank which gave him the funds based on his word that he would use the matching funds if necessary amounts to a de facto use of the qualifying certificate to secure the loan _meta_end_dot_

 this all reminds me of a classic saturday night live skit where eddie murphy gets done up with make up so he can pass as white to show how life is for white people
