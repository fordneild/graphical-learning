  another year ending and still no agreement on every issue of importance in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 no agreement on how oil revenues should be split among the major factions _meta_end_dot_

 no agreement on how to handle former baathists _meta_end_dot_

 no agreement on the promised modifications to the iraqi constitution _meta_end_dot_

 again and again even those who laud the fact that violence in iraq has returned to the levels we found intolerable in _meta_number_ref_ are frustrated by the lack of any political progress _meta_end_dot_

 and the same group that so loudly praises the invasion of iraq has a ready answer democracy and islam are incompatible _meta_end_dot_

 entire websites are dedicated to this notion _meta_end_dot_

 quotes are pulled from the qur an to demonstrate that muslims are required to follow the tenets of islam rather than any secular law _meta_end_dot_

 and they give instances in which muslims are instructed to war against those of other faiths _meta_end_dot_

 there _meta_end_exclamation_

 say those who are convinced that islam is basically incompatible with democratic society _meta_end_dot_

 how can you have people who believe these things and still have democracy _meta_end_question_

 the argument boils down to a vigorous agreement with the assessment made early in the film lawrence of arabia in which arabs are described as a little people a silly people greedy barbarous and cruel in fact that very phrase is resurrected on several sites _meta_end_dot_

 which has to make you wonder why these people were so intent on bringing freedom to iraq if they believe that this silly people is unready to handle our precious elevated and refined form of government _meta_end_dot_

 still when you consider some verses there does seem to be a case for incompatibility _meta_end_dot_

 this verse quite clearly authorizes the taking buying and selling of slaves _meta_end_dot_

 here unbelievers are subject to the most awful punishment down to the smallest child bolstering the case of those who claim this is violent religion _meta_end_dot_

 any religion that believes that those outside the select can be taken as slaves that enemies are liable to utter destruction and that anyone not following the faith not only should be but must be put to death does seem to be a poor fit for democracy _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is those last three pieces of scripture didn t come from the qur an they came from the bible _meta_end_dot_

 are the biblical verses taken out of context _meta_end_question_

 yes as are the ones from the qur an _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases these verses and others have been used by those who wanted to drape god s sanction across violent actions _meta_end_dot_

 you can imagine how often those verses on slavery taken from that great source of leviticus were used during the american civil war _meta_end_dot_

 for anyone trying to build a case for the basic incompatibility of christianity and democracy there is a rich set of scriptures available to bolster their theme _meta_end_dot_

 you can find far more violence far more intolerance and far more admonitions that only god can render justice between the covers of the bible than you will find in the qur an if only because the bible is longer _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean that christianity or judaism are incompatible with democracy _meta_end_question_

 yes to the same extent and for the same reasons that islam is also incompatible _meta_end_dot_

 all three are intrinsically ill suited to be the source of a democratic government _meta_end_dot_

 they re incompatible because theocracy is incompatible with democracy _meta_end_dot_

 every step that any government takes in providing either recognition or authority to any religion is a step away from democracy _meta_end_dot_

 that s unavoidable no matter the religion involved _meta_end_dot_

 the moment you have a government that acknowledges any religion as the true religion you have a government in which some animals are far more equal than others _meta_end_dot_

 the little people silly people argument would have it that islam is particularly poorly shaped for democracy _meta_end_dot_

 however anyone who doubts that the principles of christianity can drive just as much violence and intolerance as islam is ignorant of both history and world events _meta_end_dot_

 the history of christianity is replete with holy empires holy kingdoms and holy wars of conquest and many of them not comfortably ensconced in the distant past _meta_end_dot_

 everyone who moans that the ten commandments should be posted in every school and courthouse could benefit from contemplating the ultimate fruition of that philosophy in the god s army militia in burma _meta_end_dot_

 under the banner of bringing a government based on the ten commandments to their country god s army has killed more than a million people far more than al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 a theocratic democracy is an impossibility _meta_end_dot_

 that s just as true for christianity as it is for islam _meta_end_dot_

 but even if we accept the idea that neither christianity or islam provide a government framework for democracy there s another question is a democracy a good environment for a practicing christian muslim _meta_end_question_

 the answer is yes _meta_end_dot_

 however the answer is also that it s difficult _meta_end_dot_

 any believer living in a democracy must understand that with some fair frequency the government will pass laws that may be in opposition to her his religious beliefs so that there is a constant friction between the rule of law and the perceived rule of god _meta_end_dot_

 there s another important aspect facing believers living under a democracy and other forms of government today and that s the strength of market capitalism _meta_end_dot_

 both christianity and islam started as religions out to upend existing social orders it s very easy to see why officials of the day would have been terrified of both jesus and mohamed and both elevate the status of the poor denigrate wealth and emphasize charity _meta_end_dot_

 that s entirely at odds with the messages that we receive every day in our society _meta_end_dot_

 jesus had explicit advice on this subject when he proclaimed that believers should give the things of caesar to caesar and give the things of god to god but no less than turning the other cheek this advice is painfully difficult to follow _meta_end_dot_

 how can christians practice a religion of peace in a nation at war _meta_end_question_

 how can they uphold a message that money doesn t matter in a society that constantly bellows that nothing matters as much _meta_end_question_

 the subjects that we look as as being major religious issues such as abortion the rights of homosexuals and the war on christmas are nothing more than comfortable distractions a means of avoiding the real and aching gap that spreads between what christians profess and how most christians live in modern society _meta_end_dot_

 trying to resolve that conflict rarely means changing society _meta_end_dot_

 religions that start off as the hope of downtrodden rebels can all too easily become the instruments of powerful states _meta_end_dot_

 that s happened with both islam and christianity _meta_end_dot_

 both have been pressed into supporting every form of dictatorship and empire and ultimately every government based on these religions has been harmful not just to believers in other faiths or to believers in no faith but to the ruling religion itself _meta_end_dot_

 it was not he nature of the roman empire that was radically altered when constantine called the bishops to his estate at nicea it was the nature of christianity _meta_end_dot_

 for democracy it is probably the luckiest of strokes that karl marx built his circle of friends among the anti religious young hegelians _meta_end_dot_

 there are few more biblically sound philosophical foundations than from each according to his ability to each according to his need there s little doubt that if marx was less inimical to religion he might easily have wed communism and the church _meta_end_dot_

 and if he had all discussions of democracy today might be held between history professors _meta_end_dot_

 is christianity compatible with democracy _meta_end_question_

 let s say instead that there is no other form of government that better supports a christian s ability to participate to voice opinions and to contribute without becoming exactly the sort of oppressor that jesus railed against _meta_end_dot_

 exactly the same benefits are available to muslims to jews and those who profess any or no other faith _meta_end_dot_

 in fact democracy is nurturing to faith not because it freezes beliefs on stone tablets but because it demands that each religion must test its ideas in the public square _meta_end_dot_

 democracy forces religions to change or die _meta_end_dot_

 it forces them to evolve _meta_end_dot_

 that s how a religion that grew up with those sentiments from leviticus became a leading force in ending slavery _meta_end_dot_

 democracy is not easy for any faith but it s good for them so long as the separation between church and state is rigidly enforced _meta_end_dot_

 so i hope that all of you have enjoyed a happy hanukkah _meta_end_dot_

 a joyous eid _meta_end_dot_

 a merry christmas to come _meta_end_dot_

 and if you are not looking for the christmas star why not go out and look at the stars anyway _meta_end_question_

 happy holidays _meta_end_dot_
