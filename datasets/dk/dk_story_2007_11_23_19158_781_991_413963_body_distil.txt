  we heat up we cool down when something gets in our way _meta_end_dot_

 eh judging from history we kill it _meta_end_dot_

 scientists studying previous periods of climatic change may not always agree on the reason behind the changes in temperature but there does seem to be one factor that isn t a cause for a changing climate but a result _meta_end_dot_

 the cooling period examined most closely in this study was the little ice age a gradual temperature decline that began around _meta_number_ref_ and wasn t reversed until the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_

 during that time viking colonies in greenland died as did half the population of iceland _meta_end_dot_

 the epidemic known as the black death killed a third of the european population _meta_end_dot_

 once reliable crops failed across the continent _meta_end_dot_

 at the peak of the cold in the early to mid _meta_number_ref_th century wars starvation and riots were endemic _meta_end_dot_

 the little ice age represented a drop of less than _meta_number_ref_ degree centigrade over only part of the northern hemisphere _meta_end_dot_

 current predictions for climate change in the _meta_number_ref_st century call for from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ degrees centigrade occurring over a much shorter schedule than the changes of the little ice age _meta_end_dot_

 much greater changes much more quickly on a much more densely populated world under much greater environmental and resource stress with nations armed with much more destructive weapons _meta_end_dot_

 any predictions _meta_end_question_

 so what will the history professors of the _meta_number_ref_th century have to say about the carbon heat age _meta_end_question_
