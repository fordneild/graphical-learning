  last night the first spring thunderstorm of the year rolled through my neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 after what may qualify as the harshest winter in decades the sound of thunder and the smell of a warm rain was a welcome change _meta_end_dot_

 and the subtle change in weather can only mean one thing march madness is here _meta_end_dot_

 for once i m not talking about the ncaa tournament _meta_end_dot_

 after the most contested primary in decades it all comes down to tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 an obama win could seal the deal and ensure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 a hillary victory may send this into overtime _meta_end_dot_

 so what are the keys to victory for each _meta_end_question_

 it s funny a year ago it was expected that hillary would have easily locked up the nomination by now _meta_end_dot_

 but as john lennon famously said life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans unfortunately for hillary her plans didn t include taking the race all the way to march and now she is paying the price _meta_end_dot_

 her back is against the wall and she needs to go for the full court press _meta_end_dot_

 she cannot let up for a minute _meta_end_dot_

 she needs to get out the big names and make the high profile appearances snl daily show etc _meta_end_dot_

 she needs to activate that established money network and buy big in the numerous texas and ohio markets _meta_end_dot_

 she would do well to shore up the hispanic vote and solidify her support among women _meta_end_dot_

 the white male vote has eluded her thus far but with enough blue collar support in texas or ohio she may be able to stay in the game _meta_end_dot_

 it won t be easy or even likely but she still has a shot _meta_end_dot_

 on any given tuesday and all that jazz _meta_end_dot_

 what does obama need to do _meta_end_question_

 activate his troops _meta_end_dot_

 let s face it obama s got game _meta_end_dot_

 ground game that is _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter whether it was boise kansas city charleston memphis or new york city obama s supporters have come out in force and have been making all the difference in this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 true people power in action _meta_end_dot_

 even as i was headed into my caucus i wasn t sure who i would cast my vote for _meta_end_dot_

 the obama folks made it real easy primarily because they were there _meta_end_dot_

 in an allegedly red district where it wasn t supposed to matter dozens of obama volunteers braved the weather and the frustrated crowds _meta_end_dot_

 they even supplied a shuttle bus to a nearby shopping mall when parking near the caucus site became scarce _meta_end_dot_

 there wasn t a hillary volunteer in sight _meta_end_dot_

 stories like this seem to be the norm even in areas that weren t supposed to matter i e _meta_end_dot_

 states other than ohio _meta_end_dot_

 whether it is volunteering time to canvass phone banking making donations or sending _meta_number_ref_ pizzas to volunteers in critical areas the people power in obama s campaign has been impressive _meta_end_dot_

 so it should come as no surprise that the key to obama s game is his deep bench _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to tap into those people powered reserves and end this in regulation time _meta_end_dot_

 anyway you slice it it s going to be a hard fought battle to the end _meta_end_dot_

 given the history of march madness i wouldn t have it any other way _meta_end_dot_
