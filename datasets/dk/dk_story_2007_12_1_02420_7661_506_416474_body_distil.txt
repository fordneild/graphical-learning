  two days ago the washington post ran a front page story check that ran a front page list of debunked rumors known in some ethical circles as lies about barak obama titled appalled that the washington post chose to give a national platform to smears and politically motivated whisper campaigns i asked if the washington post was the new drudge _meta_end_question_

 i was not alone in my outrage _meta_end_dot_

 as cataloged in a diary by psericks media matters pointed out that they reported only obama s denials of madrassa smear not media debunkings while the columbia journalism review called it the single worst campaign _meta_number_ref_ piece to appear in any american newspaper so far this election cycle even the washington post s own political cartoonist slammed the newspaper with his caption reading so much discussion they ran out of space for the word lies making all of this doubly infuriating was that at the same time the washington post was using the front page of their national news paper to rehash lies they all but ignored the well researched documented news that rudy giuliani had sex with his mistress on the taxpayer s dime _meta_end_dot_

 and what was the washington post s response to the overwhelmingly negative reaction to their new drudge style reporting _meta_end_question_

 i first checked in with their ever vigilant ombudsman deborah howell but she was busy covering the question of whether the murder of sean taylor had received too much coverage _meta_end_dot_

 but lois romano a member of the washington post s team of white house and congressional reporters did respond during the post political hour _meta_end_dot_

 first on the obama story where to begin _meta_end_question_

 first their job is to report the news not to acknowledge and repeat so much garbage and falsehoods and did it occur to her that that garbage wasn t just on the internet s it was on the front page of her so called respectable newspaper _meta_end_question_

 and if it s their job to lay out the facts can she start by showing where this dicussion has reached a high pitch _meta_end_question_

 because if repeating lies from random whacko sites is now newsworthy by washington post standards i have a few suggestions for next week s political coverage laura bush murderer or maybe george bush complicit role in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attack _meta_end_dot_

 and while they re at it maybe they can finally set the record straight apollo moon landing fact or fiction _meta_end_question_

 because hey it s all on the internet _meta_end_dot_

 finally they were giving senator obama a chance to deny its accuracy _meta_end_question_

 great idea _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps next week the washington post will allow him to deny that he beats his wife _meta_end_dot_

 and what about the non coverage of the rudy does judi story _meta_end_question_

 well sure _meta_end_dot_

 the leading contender for the republican nomination for president was at best using creative bookkeeping to subsidize his illicit affair and three sentences in the middle of an article about the debate was plenty of coverage _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like he paid a lot for a haircut or anything _meta_end_dot_

 and they had nothing to add _meta_end_question_

 so if they had nothing new to add to the fact that the wtc was hit on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they wouldn t run it on the front page _meta_end_question_

 if they had nothing new to add to al gore announcing his candidacy they wouldn t run it on the front page _meta_end_question_

 is that another new standard for the washington post _meta_end_question_

 if we don t break the story we don t cover it _meta_end_question_

 matt drudge will be crushed _meta_end_dot_

 digby s take on the washington post s embarrassing lack of journalistic ethics was it doesn t matter if it s true or not _meta_end_dot_

 it s out there and sadly their own political reporter seems to agree _meta_end_dot_

 unless of course what s out there is a substantial investigative piece about rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_
