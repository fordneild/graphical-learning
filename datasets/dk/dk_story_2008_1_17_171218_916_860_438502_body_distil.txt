  on the liberal op ed page of the liberal washington post today s columnists robert novak george will david ignatius and david broder the wise man of bloviation david broder talks about the supreme value of executive experience for a presidential candidate as usual with a broder column one post is insufficient to debunk all the stupid conventional wisdom that s wrong or completely unproven _meta_end_dot_

 for instance there s little to suggest that it s because the the public remains convinced that the oval office is a place for executive talents it s true that few senators have been elected president but it s more likely that senators especially prior to the advent of national fundraising for senate candidates in recent decades just have too much baggage to win elections _meta_end_dot_

 there are so many things they actually did vote for before they voted against it that there s plenty to pull out of their record _meta_end_dot_

 plus being an outsider free of the taint of politics as usual in washington dc often explains the success of governors in national elections at least as much as executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 but nice how broder parses his list _meta_end_dot_

 missing from his list of recent senators and members of congress who became president are harry truman lyndon johnson and gerald ford none of whom had any executive experience prior to their short stints as vice president _meta_end_dot_

 on those various lists of the best and worst presidents compiled by scholars truman often ends up in the top ten and kennedy typically does well _meta_end_dot_

 ford and johnson seldom if ever appear in the bottom ten _meta_end_dot_

 another recent president with no executive experience other than as vice president was richard nixon _meta_end_dot_

 because of nixon s scandals and johnson s escalation of the vietnam war they never appear high up on lists in fact nixon s usually near the bottom _meta_end_dot_

 but for these rankings they are probably the two most complicated presidents of the _meta_number_ref_th century because of nixon s robust diplomatic involvement and johnson s passage of the civil rights and great society legislation _meta_end_dot_

 thus they had significant achievements and it wasn t their lack of executive experience that hurt them _meta_end_dot_

 but let s also look at some presidents who did have executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton had served many years as a governor yet his first few years in the white house are widely accepted to have been chaotic _meta_end_dot_

 jimmy carter is probably our nation s greatest ex president but also probably our worst presidential micro manager _meta_end_dot_

 reagan had been governor of california but he couldn t have cared less about the actual details of management and governance _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the only president of modern times with less interest in the actual workings of the office and the government is that former governor of texas george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 and despite maybe because he had a ceo running mate and a bunch of ceo s in his cabinet bush s mba presidency has been a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 if you go back a little further you can find some people with tremendous executive experience who became president _meta_end_dot_

 for instance there was the president who had run mining operations directed military defense operations in china organized massive relief efforts in the us and abroad and was a highly influential cabinet secretary greatly expanding the department of commerce _meta_end_dot_

 but are there many more reviled presidents than herbert hoover _meta_end_question_

 and arguably our nation s most effective general ulysses s _meta_end_dot_

 grant is typically rated by scholars one of our two worst presidents _meta_end_dot_

 what the fixation on executive experience neglects is that being president isn t like being a ceo _meta_end_dot_

 it s a political office _meta_end_dot_

 it requires above all leadership and political acumen _meta_end_dot_

 broder is apparently concerned that we might end up with a president with no executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 well regardless of who wins the democratic nomination it couldn t be as bad as that time when we elected a one term congressman with no executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 i mean he was so bad a civil war broke out _meta_end_dot_

 but today abraham lincoln is accepted as probably our nation s greatest president _meta_end_dot_
