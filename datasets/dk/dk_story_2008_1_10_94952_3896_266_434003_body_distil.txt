  i m sure this won t distract the pundits from crowing about the success of the escalation but _meta_end_dot_

 we are on a pace so far this year that would put us back before things improved to levels that we found intolerable pre surge and the last two days have been right up there with the worst _meta_end_dot_

 god willing things will get better but whether they do or not don t expect it to dent the narrative _meta_end_dot_
