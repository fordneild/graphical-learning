  if you didn t catch last night s democratic presidential debate from las vegas here s what you missed trustworthy competence _meta_end_dot_

 mcjoan and trapper john did a stellar tag team job of live blogging the debate from the cashman center starting here and they captured the back and forth very well _meta_end_dot_

 to get a good synopsis of the questions and answers you should read their reports _meta_end_dot_

 midway through however trapper john wrote an insightful summary of the entire nigh the debate didn t start out that way _meta_end_dot_

 the best moment of the night didn t come from any of the candidates or from moderators tim russert or brian williams but from a heckler _meta_end_dot_

 the opening questions focused on the skirmishes between the clinton and obama campaigns on issues of race _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton tried to tamp down the race talk _meta_end_dot_

 both attributed the acrimony to over zealous campaign staff and surrogates but accepted ultimate responsibility for not having asserted sufficient control over their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 russert channeled millions of angry white men and asked edwards what is a white male to do running against these historic candidacies edwards provided the right answer so the meta debate the navel gazing the identity politics encounter group session was done right _meta_end_question_

 no because timmeh had bring up the likeability issue asking obama about his clumsy you re likeable enough hillary comment from the previous debate and then asking edwards if the boys were ganging up on the girl _meta_end_dot_

 just i thought i might be transported to a bad dream set in _meta_number_ref_ complete with bill bennett dinesh d souza and chants of hey hey ho ho western culture s got to go we were saved by a heckler the candidates seemed relieved and they settled in to what trapper john referred to as mid season form they were sharp very precise in some of their answers even looking for small distinctions in their positions on iraq and other subject to help them distinguish themselves without attacking their rivals _meta_end_dot_

 the format included some twists new to this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 instead of standing at lecterns the candidates sat next to each other at a table which seemed to instill a more casual approach more like they were participating in a discussion _meta_end_dot_

 being out of iowa and new hampshire meant we finally could hear an emphasis on a wider array of subjects nevada has the nation s highest rate of foreclosures and each candidate invoked the problem _meta_end_dot_

 they discussed their differing positions on past bankruptcy legislation _meta_end_dot_

 clinton played to the hometown crowd by noting her consistent opposition to the yucca mountain repository but that subject widened to the suitability or necessity of nuclear power as part of a national energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 with the passage of the iowa and new hampshire contests the candidates appeared to have finally burned off the excess adrenalin produced by the excitement that builds to a crescendo before the start of a long anticipated contest _meta_end_dot_

 they were calm and seemingly at pains to not be too combative _meta_end_dot_

 even with the modified format the candidates were even allowed to pose a question to each other as usual it was clinton who conveyed the most confidence _meta_end_dot_

 she s fine in a speech or q and a setting but she excels in a debate where she can repeatedly illustrate arguments with what she touts as her accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 she s the candidate of competence and accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is generally the same in almost any venue or format and last night was no different his message is about understanding you and fighting for you _meta_end_dot_

 he portrays himself as having done it his entire life first for himself to rise from a middling background and then on behalf of is clients and now on behalf of all americans _meta_end_dot_

 since his adult life before politics was spent as a plaintiff s attorney and litigator he has the discipline of a litigator to stay on topic and play to his audience _meta_end_dot_

 obama is the candidate most constrained in debates he s not bad but he doesn t exude the same ease dealing with rivals that he exudes in talking to members of a crowd or a town hall and his oratorical gifts aren t as well suited for a debate _meta_end_dot_

 he did however have the quip of the night _meta_end_dot_

 asked by russert about the supposed phenomenon of hispanic voters not voting for african american candidates he responded not in illinois they voted for me talking about himself is where obama is most comfortable and his campaign s message really is obama himself as the candidate who can transcend divisions and bring people together _meta_end_dot_

 for instance he talked about how more african american men need to be attentive fathers something democratic candidates who aren t themselves african american must treat with care to avoid the appearance of race baiting _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton did a nice job of boxing him in her question to him where she asked him to co sponsor her bill placing requirements that the president seek approval from congress on major policy matters regarding iraq obama stammered a bit and didn t commit _meta_end_dot_

 it was a deft move by clinton and her campaign because it demonstrated that at least regarding clinton his knee jerk reaction was not to work with her and transcend differences clinton s campaign focuses on her achievements and her dogged work as why one should want to support her _meta_end_dot_

 asked by russert to describe their greatest strengths and weaknesses clinton said she s a passionate patriot who works for others but that she is sometimes impatient i couldn t help but think this is supposed to assuage the concerns of some of the men and maybe some more traditionally minded women who don t really like her much because they think of her as a pushy woman with edwards the message is you the voter edwards understands you and just as he was your advocate as a plantiff s attorney taking on the big corporations and special interests he ll be your advocate and fight for you as president because he understands you and is one of us _meta_end_dot_

 because edwards is so disciplined he seldom has a weak performance _meta_end_dot_

 but because he is so disciplined he seldom has a performance that s significantly different _meta_end_dot_

 last night was yet another in a long line of highly accomplished but not stunning performances _meta_end_dot_

 after a debate the inevitable question is who won i can t say that any one person won _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t looked yet at the press reactions although i did catch about _meta_number_ref_ seconds of chris mathews spewing spittle at the camera about how hillary clinton was teh awesome _meta_end_dot_

 i saw it differently _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there was much new _meta_end_dot_

 competence and preparation seldom produces compelling television and last night was no exception _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the debate was kind of boring _meta_end_dot_

 after the frustrating opening with all the identity politics the candidates settled in to making sensible comments and mostly agreeing with each other _meta_end_dot_

 it was very reassuring to know that one of these three will be our standard bearer in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 but i sort of missed the spectacle of the republicans each pandering to the far right and marginalizing themselves for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 each of our three candidates brings tremendous strengths to the contest _meta_end_dot_

 any of them would be a strong general election candidate and they all appear to be sufficiently prepared to enter the white house in _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad more people are seeing our impressive candidates _meta_end_dot_

 but frankly i m impatient and even a bit distracted _meta_end_dot_

 the fun is on the republican side where the candidates and various factions of the gop are in a vicious war that could blow the party up _meta_end_dot_

 i look forward to having our candidate chosen and to seeing the contrast between our candidate s competence vision and identification with the real needs and concerns of the american people with whichever flavor of craziness prevails on the republican side _meta_end_dot_
