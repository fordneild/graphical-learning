  the delay in consideration of the fisa telecom amnesty bill gains critical time for more senators to examine the supposed legal justifications for telecom amnesty and thereby come to the same conclusion that sen _meta_end_dot_

 ron wyden did but there s another reason too _meta_end_dot_

 if we hadn t had that dodd fight yesterday we would have seen the procedure dictating the outcome of the bill and plenty of senatorial steak sauce to go around _meta_end_dot_

 that is without dodd s fight we end up with the intel bill as the underlying bill and an unanimous consent agreement requiring _meta_number_ref_ votes for any amendment to pass which then means it takes _meta_number_ref_ votes to adopt the judiciary committee substitute version with no telecom amnesty in it _meta_end_dot_

 that pretty much guarantees an eventual loss _meta_end_dot_

 that in turn means dem senators get to go home and if they face an upset constituent who opposed telecom amnesty he can say yeah so did i _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i voted against it and for the substitute amendment without immunity but we just didn t have the votes even if the truth was that they had managed to muster _meta_number_ref_ for it which was in doubt to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 you end up with a situation in which you get to cast a freebie protest vote but still get what you want if you secretly wanted immunity to pass _meta_end_dot_

 dodd s fight exposed that and removed that cover by questioning and objecting to the unanimous consent agreement right off the bat _meta_end_dot_

 without that fight a senator like the hypothetical example above gets to have his cake and eat it too while giving constituents answers that are technically correct enough to temporarily stump them long enough for them to make it out the back door and that the traditional media did absolutely nothing to prepare them to see through _meta_end_dot_
