  here s a good one from the politico d oh _meta_end_exclamation_

 but here s another question what kind of bank accepts a fundraising list as collateral for a loan _meta_end_question_

 if the list is worth anything near the value of the loan why doesn t the campaign just go to the list and get the money _meta_end_question_

 if there s any value at all to the list and i can t say there s absolutely none obviously then it must be of value only to people who aren t john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 because if it was of the value he says it is then he d have the damned money wouldn t he _meta_end_question_

 the bank knows fundraising lists do have value of course _meta_end_dot_

 but the value must only be available to other people _meta_end_dot_

 people the bank could sell the list to in order to recover their losses in the event of a mccain default _meta_end_dot_

 people like _meta_end_dot_

 other republicans seeking to raise money i guess _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 which means what _meta_end_question_

 that mccain s list is exhausted at least so far as giving money to mccain is concerned but that they might be willing to dig deep for someone else _meta_end_question_

 the campaign of course has a different spin well that s something _meta_end_dot_

 pins yard signs phones and computers plus a list that isn t working _meta_end_dot_

 two things about that fiscal responsibility and straight talk all wrapped up in one neat package _meta_end_exclamation_

 now show me the change senator magoo _meta_end_exclamation_
