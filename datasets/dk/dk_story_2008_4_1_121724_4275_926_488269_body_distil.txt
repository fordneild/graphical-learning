  in a post office in lancaster pa on march _meta_number_ref_ half the people standing in line with me were holding voter registration forms this on top of the massive voter drives organized by the clinton and obama campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 the signs are all around us that voters are keenly interested in the april _meta_number_ref_nd primary _meta_end_dot_

 on friday night for example at my neighbor s traditional waiting for opening day party the conservative crowd was not just willing to talk about obama and clinton but actually evaluating them pretty closely _meta_end_dot_

 though nobody cared to discuss mccain whom they dislike i heard all about obama s latest commercials _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ from the tenor of this fishing party i had predicted that republicans were in deep trouble in this slice of red america _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ my impression was that democrats are truly ascendent in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 numbers released yesterday by the state h t creweeny though still incomplete confirm that picture _meta_end_dot_

 total democratic registration up more than _meta_percent_ref_ since last november and over _meta_percent_ref_ since _meta_number_ref_ has now reached _meta_percent_ref_ in pa _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast republican numbers dropped by _meta_percent_ref_ this year to below _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 alone in the last week before the march _meta_number_ref_ deadline _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new voters registered as democrats whereas only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new republican voters were added _meta_end_dot_

 in the same week another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters changed their registration to the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters reregistered as republicans that week which means that they suffered massive defections _meta_end_dot_

 it was such a landslide that pa republicans are now promising to mount an aggressive post primary effort to woo voters back to their failing party _meta_end_dot_

 good luck with that _meta_end_dot_

 there were some very big democratic gains in rural counties in central pa _meta_end_dot_

 for example democratic registration shot up _meta_percent_ref_ in dauphin county _meta_percent_ref_ in lebanon and _meta_percent_ref_ in york _meta_end_dot_

 in three central counties columbia clinton and clearfield democratic registration actually overtook the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in some others like centre county democrats are within striking distance of taking the lead _meta_end_dot_

 and in surburban philadelphia democrats added tens of thousands of new voters _meta_end_dot_

 in montgomery the republican party has nearly lost its looooooooong time majority _meta_end_dot_

 for all the complaining about the extended primary season we re doing pretty well _meta_end_dot_
