  call it mendacity call it hypocrisy or call it richard cohen because after reading his column in today s washington post it s clear that those words are all interchangable _meta_end_dot_

 in a column about a lie that wasn t a lie cohen begins with a lie of his own apparently mr _meta_end_dot_

 cohen decided to ignore the fact that the cost of edwards haircut s was revealed through wait for it the edwards campaign s fec filings _meta_end_dot_

 and with that mendacious start cohen moves on to the real target of his ire barack obama well if that formidable truth squad says it it must be wrong right _meta_end_question_

 wrong so with the entire premise of mr _meta_end_dot_

 cohen s screed disproven perhaps this is all that needs to be said about his latest load of codswollop _meta_end_dot_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 after saying that he understood why obama made the claim because it ought to be true huh he meanders into perhaps the oddest aside in pundicratic history whether cohen felt the need to once more reiterate his support for invading iraq or if he felt that a column about obama wasn t complete without a reminder that his middle name is hussein isn t clear _meta_end_dot_

 but it does provide a segue of unintended humor when he next cites the phrase the delusional style in american punditry as he agrees with someone who says obama isn t a portrait of sterling honesty or authenticity pot meet kettle _meta_end_dot_

 which brings cohen back to his original concern since cohen isn t concerned about the actual truth it s impossible to take him seriously when he wants to talk about larger truths particularly when you read john edwards lied about his haircut except he didn t obama lied about statistics except he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 mccain did and does lie about the constitution but that s okay because cohen knows his character _meta_end_question_

 that pretty much sums mr _meta_end_dot_

 cohen s character doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 and his mendacity _meta_end_dot_
