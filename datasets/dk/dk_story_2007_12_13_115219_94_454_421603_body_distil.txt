  running for national office is a nasty brutish thing _meta_end_dot_

 you re accused of being a horrible person half the people hate you and your reward if you win is a trip to washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 so while i can t blame him i sure wish former ag mike moore had run for senate _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves the field open for former gov _meta_end_dot_

 ronnie musgrove _meta_end_dot_

 musgrove among other things is a fan of alabama s roy moore and his ten commandments ploy pushed legislation to ban gay adoptions and mississippi still refuses to recognize such adoptions from other states pushed legislation to require in god we trust to be displayed in every classroom refused to publicly advocate for a state flag without the confederate battle flag and has spoken about our christian heritage and has trashed groups like the aclu for pushing the notion of freedom _from_ religion _meta_end_dot_

 guess where he stands on choice _meta_end_question_

 he s a theocon of the worst kind seeking to impose his christian viewpoints on others by force of governmental action _meta_end_dot_

 the guy was active in the dlc but he s waaaaay to the right of even the corporate democrat crowd _meta_end_dot_

 and what s horrifying about this all is that the republican will be even worse _meta_end_dot_

 mississippi will ultimately decide who represents them _meta_end_dot_

 i don t envy their choices _meta_end_dot_

 and regardless of who they choose nationally it s a lose lose proposition _meta_end_dot_
