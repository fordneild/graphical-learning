  in response to yesterday s obstruction on the part of the republicans to moving the fisa bill forward harry reid had this to say to bush reid has called bush s bluff it s clear to reid and should be clear to all senators by now that the republicans are using this issue as their last ditch attempt to play the fear card _meta_end_dot_

 it exposes the ultimate lie here if the damned bill were so critical to the nation s security the republicans wouldn t be doing everything in their power to gum it up _meta_end_dot_

 to highlight that fact reid has put two options before the senate s _meta_number_ref_ a one month paa extension introduced on thursday and s _meta_number_ref_ which would postpone a rewrite of fisa for about _meta_number_ref_ months which he introduced today _meta_end_dot_

 reid filed for cloture on the _meta_number_ref_ day extension s _meta_number_ref_ yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that means once the republicans cloture vote on the whole bill is done they will vote on this extension _meta_end_dot_

 making it all the more important for the republicans cloture vote to fail _meta_end_dot_

 if it does then republicans will have little choice but to vote with the democrats for an extension of the paa _meta_end_dot_

 it s either that or be the ones who let the law expire _meta_end_dot_

 the rhetoric from their president has gotten so high that the tactic could backfire on them if they re the ones opposing an extension _meta_end_dot_

 time is ultimately on reid s side on this one _meta_end_dot_

 the house as of now is not prepared to accept the senate bill as is even if the republicans manage to get cloture on it _meta_end_dot_

 the house passed their version of the bill last year and it does not include telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 opposition to amnesty is much stronger in the house _meta_end_dot_

 so it is highly unlikely that we would see a repeat of last august when a bad senate fisa bill was shoved down the throats of the house _meta_end_dot_

 with the paa set to expire next friday and the house in recess starting wednesday for a democratic retreat bush and the republicans are going to have to agree to an extension or take responsibility for the threat to america
