  check out this ridiculousness the senate is too partisan _meta_end_exclamation_

 or is it _meta_end_question_

 the next paragraph deal making in gop parlance and that of the beltway isn t the same as deal making in normal english usage _meta_end_dot_

 it means we get our way the democrats be damned _meta_end_dot_

 so too partisan in republican and beltway pundit parlance means democrats are demanding a say _meta_end_dot_

 it was sooo much easier when dc was a one party town and the gop could do whatever it wanted _meta_end_dot_

 sure the rest of the country and the world will suffer the repercussions for generations to come _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t too partisan _meta_end_exclamation_

 and that made it good _meta_end_exclamation_

 or something _meta_end_dot_
