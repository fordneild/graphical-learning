  as a radical democrat and a radical d emocrat i ve long had mixed reactions about the work of hendrik hertzberg the liberal writer who i first met at the national student association in _meta_number_ref_ and who returned in _meta_number_ref_ to the new yorker after various stints as a jimmy carter speechwriter and two runs as the new republic s editor _meta_end_dot_

 his first time at the helm at tnr was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when the magazine s staffers could not quite agree how they felt about ronald reagan s foreign policy particularly in central america _meta_end_dot_

 hertzberg himself found that policy abhorrent just as he had gradually if belatedly decided he hated vietnam policy during his three years in the navy _meta_end_dot_

 but tnr owner publisher marty peretz fought every attempt by hertzberg to give the contras the terrorist label they deserved and to deny that label to nelson mandela and his movement _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly peretz s faction chose instead never to speak harshly of the reagan administration s diehard support for the racist murderers of the apartheid regime _meta_end_dot_

 that hertzberg returned for a second round of editing stuck in my craw almost as much as the fact that i wish my word craft were half as eloquent as his _meta_end_dot_

 on one subject however i ve always agreed with his take the desperate need for revamping the way we do elections _meta_end_dot_

 election reform of course is a big subject including everything from ensuring paper trails of unhackable electronic voting machines to how ludicrous it is that two states making up less than _meta_percent_ref_ of the national population have such a titanic influence on our presidential choices to the rhinoceroses in the room called corporate contributions which haven t been effectively reined in despite a century of efforts starting with the _meta_number_ref_ tillman act _meta_end_dot_

 but hertzberg s mini crusade matters too _meta_end_dot_

 he writes about it for the umpteenth time today in his the new yorker blog from those of us who want never again want to see supreme court nominations emanating from someone like dick ch mister bush the irv provides the benefit of undercutting the spoiler effect of fractional third parties even third parties with which we may have considerable agreement on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 from the point of view of some members of those third parties whether of the left or right it offers a way to take a pure stand on a first choice whom they know has no chance of victory but to hedge their bets with a second choice to avoid electing a candidate who for instance favors uniforms and armbands _meta_end_dot_

 but from the point of view of those who utterly detest the two party system irv in the short run anyway means helping those two parties even if it as hertzberg argues nudges them more in the direction of the minor parties _meta_end_dot_

 for someone who sees american salvation in a third party who thinks the latest third party incarnation can overcome the flaws of those parties whose bones and phantoms litter the american political landscape irv might very well be viewed as a cul de sac _meta_end_dot_

 a snare and a delusion as my grandmother used to say _meta_end_dot_

 instead of expanding the two party system into the pluralist system that the third party advocates desire they see it as reinforcing it _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand from the point of view of the leaders and strongest backers of major parties irv opens up a can of worms _meta_end_dot_

 as long as the minor parties stay minor a preference voting system would benefit the majors _meta_end_dot_

 but let s say a third party eventually gathers enough votes to raise serious opposition to the two major parties at least at the state level _meta_end_dot_

 then the issue of spoiler again arises _meta_end_dot_

 these factors make it unlikely we ll see irv come to pass beyond a few localities any time soon despite being backed by a number of organizations _meta_end_dot_

 which is too bad because the present system denies progressives not to mention radical democrats a chance to gain the clout inside the party that we deserve _meta_end_dot_

 like any reform irv is no panacea to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 but it would be better than what we ve got _meta_end_dot_
