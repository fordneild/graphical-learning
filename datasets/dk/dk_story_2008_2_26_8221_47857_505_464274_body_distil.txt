  one of the interesting consequences of climate change is greater precipitation from wetter more intense weather systems _meta_end_dot_

 the local result might mean excess snow fall in normally drier and warmer climes _meta_end_dot_

 but take a look at how the anti science brigade spins it and admire the sheer intellectual dishonesty on display starting with the headline note the double standard a _meta_number_ref_ year warming trend verified in everything from commercial shipping records to pristine ice cores can be waved away with the implication that record keeping was less comprehensive and thus less reliable before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but the accuracy and quality of seasonal variances and sun spot records beginning in _meta_number_ref_ made in part by a handful of chinese astrologers and bedouin tribesmen centuries before the invention of the modern solar telescope are indisputable _meta_end_dot_

 and if you think that s funny the article also notes that despite alarmist s shrieking over empirical observations such as the recent record busting ice melt in the arctic the ice is back _meta_end_exclamation_

 gosh who could have predicted the ice would return to the north pole in february _meta_end_question_

 this is what passes for a science article in today s mainstream conservative media _meta_end_dot_

 but it s part of a tragic pattern that s all too familiar _meta_end_dot_

 one not confined to science or conservative rags if only it were _meta_end_dot_

 tripe like this is grist for our idiocracy to be passed back and forth among conservative circles gaining half witted followers and losing detail like a game of telegraph in a kindergarten class until it ultimately leaks in some form into conventional media wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 how long before the anti science lobby enlists the media in hope of discrediting climate science by citing that very headline to imply how looney those silly scientists were for warning of a looming ice age in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 not long i bet _meta_end_dot_

 that pattern has become pervasive it now reaches into our most prestigious news venues and nothing not even the inevitable loss of credibility that invariably follows seems to stop it _meta_end_dot_

 over and over the traditional media is burnt to a crisp by reporting uncritically what right wing sources tell them _meta_end_dot_

 or the editors simply turn over their editorial page to hyper partisan shills with an almost flawless track record of being dead wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and so we re treated to an endless procession of erroneous reporting they know where the weapons of mass destruction are no one could have predicted the levees would fail the white house had nothing to do with valeria plame being exposed and anyone who did will be fired the surge is working and on and on and on _meta_end_dot_

 the gop pr gurus have learned they can simply fax their talking points to a wide eyed media who will stamp them with the seal of legitimate journalism _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how embarrassing it is for the news organization in question when the facts come out and in spite of some damn fine independent reporting here and there too many stenographers pretending to be reporters dutifully go back for a second and third helping of fresh steaming wingnut bullshit _meta_end_dot_

 and too many editors let them slide time and time again _meta_end_dot_

 at what point does the media cease being a victim and begin to share culpability for the consequences _meta_end_question_
