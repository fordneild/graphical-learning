  do you prefer the statistics about home foreclosures or would you rather read reports about people losing their homes _meta_end_question_

 do you read the health care analysis diaries or case reports of disasters that hit the uninsured _meta_end_question_

 both statistics and case reports tell a story and they both impact decisions but in very different ways _meta_end_dot_

 the same is true for stats about influenza and stories about children dying from influenza _meta_end_dot_

 both scenarios were on display this week both in atlanta cdc pandemic drill and hong kong seasonal influenza outbreak _meta_end_dot_

 let s explore that a bit more _meta_end_dot_

 back in february _meta_number_ref_ the center for disease control and prevention cdc was confronted with this mock scenario it s a terrific thing by the way that these drills are taking place _meta_end_dot_

 drilling and practice makes the actual response that much stronger and while no exercise can be completely realistic systems glitches will occur and be caught and improved on for the next time _meta_end_dot_

 with outbreaks in multiple states the exercise picked up where it left off a few months later april _meta_number_ref_ flash forward to march _meta_number_ref_ where i joined the cdc exercise for two days as a mostly observer _meta_end_dot_

 that conference room is just behind the cdc s emergency operations center pictured above during this week s continuation of the exercise _meta_end_dot_

 each of the _meta_number_ref_ monitors is manned by someone coordinating one or another of the fuctions cdc needs to fulfill in a pandemic such as collecting state data on hospital beds or sharing their expertise and advice to local and state offcilas on infection control quarantine and legal issues _meta_end_dot_

 there are liasons with key government partners like state and dod in the scenario military personnel on an overseas ship are affected _meta_end_dot_

 it s now day _meta_number_ref_ of the pandemic according to the exercise and the cdc director julie gerberding is calling the georgia state emergency manager to find out if georgia schools are closing the answer is not yet to assess the impact on cdc employees if their kids are sent home _meta_end_dot_

 that s important information for many reasons _meta_end_dot_

 school closure more properly termed student dismissal the buildings remain open and might be used for alternate treatment centers or school lunch distribution is a linch pin in the community mitigation strategy that cdc recommends in a severe pandemic see this brief discussion on community mitigation from dec _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however the dependence on local decision making means that smooth execution of well laid plans is not assured _meta_end_dot_

 for example here s what happened in atlanta this week bolded added
