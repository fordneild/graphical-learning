  another reason why despite the fun everyone is having it s time for hillary clinton to recognize it s time to acknowledge that barack obama is our nominee when john kerry effectively secured the _meta_number_ref_ nomination at the beginning of march he was broke _meta_end_dot_

 the bush campaign and the rnc were waiting to tee off on him and try to kill him in the crib _meta_end_dot_

 but it didn t happen in part because the moment the rnc launched with something like _meta_dollor_ref_ million in advertising against kerry the media fund run by clinton consigliere harold ickes launched with a similarly powerful barrage against bush _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of may or so both sides had run a tremendous amount of early advertising but the media fund had held off bush s attacks kerry avoided significant damage and he had reloaded his coffers so he could wage his own advertising assault _meta_end_dot_

 this time around nothing like that is happening _meta_end_dot_

 some donors are waiting for the nomination to be settled _meta_end_dot_

 others will only give if it s their preferred nominee _meta_end_dot_

 there are questions about who will staff some of the operations _meta_end_dot_

 and we have yet to arrive at the everyone rally around the democratic nominee be unified and redirect our fire outward against the republicans stage _meta_end_dot_

 until we do independent operations against mccain will probably remain paralyzed _meta_end_dot_

 by prolonging the race hillary clinton is imposing democrats a huge opportunity cost _meta_end_dot_

 because she hasn t acknowledged that she won t be the nominee and it s time to support barack obama john mccain is escaping early attacks by either our nominee or by independent groups operating independent of our nominees campaign but allied with our cause _meta_end_dot_
