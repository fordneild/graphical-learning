  last results _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ edwards and the rest _meta_end_dot_

 the last rankings were from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ after hillary had suffered a couple of bad weeks _meta_end_dot_

 well the holidays were no better and she continued bleeding support through the end of the year and into the new year _meta_end_dot_

 then iowa happened and well she s no longer at the top _meta_end_dot_

 the top tier _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama he won iowa new hampshire is falling in line for the expected rubber stamp and the clinton campaign is reeling see below _meta_end_dot_

 his youth participation numbers are off the charts independents love him and may even help deprive mccain of a big nh victory because they d rather vote for obama and the republicans have no idea how to respond to him republicans spent so long running against hillary that they ve been left having to improvise responses to obama _meta_end_dot_

 and since their entire schtick seemed to be i m the one best able to defeat hillary their reason for existence is threatened _meta_end_dot_

 calling obama a scary liberal isn t quite going to cut it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton her campaign is in civil war mode _meta_end_dot_

 her advisers are conceding likely losses in new hampshire and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 and suddenly the firewall becomes florida alongside rudy two new yorkers praying against hope that transplanted yankees breathe new life into their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 i m not necessarily going to discount hillary s chances in places like new jersey and california new york seems a given or places like texas but her inevitability theme deeply wounded by iowa would be a rotting corpse after a full month of primary losses _meta_end_dot_

 designed to scare off strong opposition and dry up her opponents fundraising the inevitability thing simply set her up for a bigger fall _meta_end_dot_

 oops _meta_end_dot_

 the second tier _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards edwards clearly aligned himself with obama against hillary in saturday s debate perhaps hoping that the rest of the contests this month deliver a hillary knock out _meta_end_dot_

 but a _meta_number_ref_ on _meta_number_ref_ contest between edwards and obama favors the frontrunner as obama has the money crowds and organization that edwards was never able to generate _meta_end_dot_

 yet his fiery rhetoric often set the tone for the campaign and his leadership on issues as diverse as the nevada fox news debate and iraq helped push the primary in a decidedly progressive direction _meta_end_dot_

 the rest some richardson is playing for veep the others are playing for _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why _meta_end_dot_

 i won t try to guess _meta_end_dot_
