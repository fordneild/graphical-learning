  if you re a republican presidential candidate and you ve made up your mind to exaggerate something about the nature of your relationship with dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr you re gonna want to do it the mitt romney way of course neither romney nor his father marched with king in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 but the point is that a modern politician knows that if you re gonna lie about mlk you lie about how much you liked and admired him _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if you re a stone age republican like john mccain this doesn t occur to you _meta_end_dot_

 instead you exaggerate by minimizing your recognition of king s impact on and importance to modern american society or else you pretend you ve only kinda sorta heard of him it s interesting though isn t it _meta_end_question_

 mccain says the assassinations of king and kennedy weren t really meaningful to a p o w _meta_end_dot_

 and i can certainly understand how your one s own seemingly hopeless captivity could do that to you _meta_end_dot_

 but yet mccain would have us believe that he whiled away the hours tapping away excitedly in code to his fellow prisoners about the virtues of ronald reagan really _meta_end_dot_

 never really got mlk but engaged in secret tap code rap sessions about ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 mmm hmm _meta_end_dot_
