  taking this debate as a whole a few things struck me hard _meta_end_dot_

 first there s the massive irony that the wireless in the press filing center at the facebook sponsored debate sucks elephant balls _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that do you think mccain and huckabee got together and agreed to go after romney on his weaselly position changing in particular _meta_end_question_

 because they were brutal and it obviously got to romney who a couple times asked them to stop attacking him personally _meta_end_dot_

 this has got to have been a painful evening for romney because every barb landed _meta_end_dot_

 those landings were audibly observed in the press filing center _meta_end_dot_

 this is the third debate i ve attended as press and the first second and third biggest responses from the assembled reporters at those three debates combined have all been to these shots at mitt _meta_end_dot_

 big whoa s and ooohs _meta_end_dot_

 the hundreds of people in this room pictured seem to have been waiting for that kind of moment _meta_end_dot_
