  three years ago on thanksgiving i wrote a piece called sigh time to make fun of detroit again _meta_end_dot_

 a few days earlier at a detroit pistons game in suburban auburn hills a brawl broke out between the pistons and the indiana pacers and it moved in to the stands after a couple jerks in the hundred dollar plus seats threw stuff at the pacers _meta_end_dot_

 it set off the old familiar pattern of the national press presenting the detroit area as a massive hellhole _meta_end_dot_

 this week the pattern is again visible as detroit possibly america s most disrespected city was rated america s most dangerous city _meta_end_dot_

 at times like that i feel defensive of my hometown and obviously others do too because that piece generated some of the most wistful and heartfelt comments i ve seen at daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 probably because it was thanksgiving a holiday more than any other that we associate almost exclusively with family and home by which i mean a place not a house it brought forth comments from members of the detroit diaspora as well as many others marveling at our love of home or sharing their own feelings about what home means to them _meta_end_dot_

 one of the comments on that thread summed up why so many of us feel love for our hometown wherever that may be that commenter nailed it _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect i recognize now that i felt compelled to write that essay because i was sorting through the emotions of realizing that was going to leave my hometown and that while i would certainly return regularly that i would probably never again live in the detroit area _meta_end_dot_

 the last few thanksgivings i ve thought about the responses to that essay and how passionate people are about places they call home _meta_end_dot_

 almost everyone has some place that possibly independent of where their family is they consider home _meta_end_dot_

 a friend from europe recently told me that she thought i wasn t a typical american because i understood the concept of loving a city _meta_end_dot_

 i told her we may not talk and think about it the way europeans talk about their cities but that many americans do in fact feel a strong love for their hometowns _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been thinking about the idea of home a lot as after an itinerate year moving around between dc and new england i ve now spent most of the last year in dc and i m beginning to feel more comfortable one might even say at home i m discovering things i like about it such as the diversity the earnestness of many people here who really do want to make a difference in the world the official culture the sense that many people here whether they accept it or not have been entrusted with great responsibilities and many do take seriously those responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 but there s plenty about home besides my family and friends that i miss _meta_end_dot_

 i miss being around thoughtful cosmopolitan people who ve never gotten a visa stamp but understand other peoples largely through learning and imagination and maybe by getting to know some of their neighbors who might be from lebanon or bosnia or iraq or bangladesh or friends who still practice traditions their great grandparents brought from poland or italy or malta or belgium or greece or kentucky or alabama or as in my case canada _meta_end_dot_

 when i drive back to detroit i get an almost physical sensation of knowing i m back home as i drive north on i _meta_number_ref_ because i see enormous buildings that don t house federal employees or defense contractors but contain assembly lines and foundries and steel mills seeing those buildings and knowing it was jobs in those kinds of buildings in some cases the very same ones that brought my grandparents to detroit in the _meta_number_ref_ s gives me a sense of rootedness _meta_end_dot_

 i miss being in a place where the hippest people around aren t recent college grads but are probably a multi pierced thirty something woman who works in a resale shop or maybe a _meta_number_ref_ year old guy who does computer aided design for a small engineering contractor to the big three _meta_end_dot_

 i miss that most people aren t trying to impress _meta_end_dot_

 there s more self effacing humor in detroit than in dc _meta_end_dot_

 i miss glorious summer days on a lake frigid january mornings having to wear a sweater in october driving _meta_number_ref_ miles an hour with the flow of traffic democratic party meetings where half the people are in a labor union seeing canadian license plates in every shopping center and i really want some good lebanese food and a coney island and a vernors _meta_end_dot_

 on and off for the last three years i ve thought about henrydavid s observation that loving your home is really a demonstration of patriotism a demonstration of loving your country _meta_end_dot_

 so tonight as you sit around in your tryptophan induced stupors think about what home means to you and please share it with us _meta_end_dot_

 tell us where home is and why you love it _meta_end_dot_
