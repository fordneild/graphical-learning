  the youth turnout numbers are stellar and it looks like the democratic caucuses got double the turnout that republican ones did _meta_end_dot_

 this all bodes well for the future and at the end of the day i m damned proud of all of our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 now i m rooting for edwards to hang on to second place _meta_end_dot_

 good guys bad guys
