  there s little doubt that the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright s words with _meta_number_ref_ years of sermons trimmed down to a few three word phrases was enough to cause trouble for senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 but after the speech _meta_end_question_

 despite desperate efforts by the pundits to slice and dice obama s speech into loose phonemes and reconstruct them in some way they could ridicule it seems that a good percentage of people actually listened to the speech _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully this is not just a good sign for barack obama but a good sign that the country is ready to engage in honest dialog over divisive issues _meta_end_dot_

 so all the naysayers from juan williams to pity pat buchanan who declared that obama should have instead thrown away all connection to his church and groveled for forgiveness can now move on to their analysis of how the american people just don t get it _meta_end_dot_
