  tomorrow s national weather service forecast for cleveland a forecast of freezing rain can t be off very much and still be accurate a few degrees colder and it s a run of the mill late winter snow storm _meta_end_dot_

 a nuisance but nothing that would cause major problems for people accustomed to snow _meta_end_dot_

 and a few degree warmer and it s just rain _meta_end_dot_

 but if they do get freezing rain in ohio what will the effect be on the primary _meta_end_question_

 first of all the weather in ohio won t effect the contests in texas rhode island or vermont _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary clinton wins texas and wins ohio she ll declare that she has survived the horrible run of loses in february and is now back in the game _meta_end_dot_

 it still leaves the question of whether or not she can overtake obama in the delegate count but by the standards set by the clinton campaign she will have achieved her goal _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins texas and ohio and the weather isn t a factor he ll declare and many will agree with him that he s established a clear and growing lead among the delegates and that it s time for clinton to drop out _meta_end_dot_

 what s tougher to game out is the result of a split decision _meta_end_dot_

 it appear more likely that if they split the two big states it will be obama winning texas and clinton winning ohio _meta_end_dot_

 if the weather can t be invoked as a factor on the results a split would appear to most people as going to obama because it would almost certainly mean that his delegate lead would grow _meta_end_dot_

 however the worst scenario for a clean resolution is probably for the weather to be bad and clinton to lose ohio _meta_end_dot_

 based on the clinton campaign s easily relocated goal posts it s hard to not imagine them arguing that a loss amidst an ice storm should not be grounds for ending her campaign and that when we get to a real contest in a big state when the weather should be fine in other words the pennsylvania primary seven weeks from now that clinton will win and demonstrate that she s the strong candidate _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 so for any of you who pray and who want a contest that yields results that can t be dismissed or ignored pray that the temperature in ohio is _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ degrees warmer than currently forecast _meta_end_dot_
