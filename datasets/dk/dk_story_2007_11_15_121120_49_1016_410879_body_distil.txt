  it ll never be airtight _meta_end_dot_

 most security efforts are really for show _meta_end_dot_

 you basically try to make it as inconvenient as possible for potential terrorists to make an attempt _meta_end_dot_

 but a determined enemy can thwart most attacks _meta_end_dot_

 for example the armored cockpit doors are great if you re in the air but when you first walk on a plane the door is always open _meta_end_dot_

 sure the terrorists would have to learn to take off but still the opportunity is there to commandeer a plane and try to ram it into something even if it s just the neighborhood the airport is located in before fighter jets are scrambled to intercept _meta_end_dot_

 that s why our best tools in this fight are law enforcement and the intelligence services _meta_end_dot_
