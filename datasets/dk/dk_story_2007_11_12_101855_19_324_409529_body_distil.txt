  an ode to karl rove that s the nicest thing i will ever post about rove _meta_end_dot_

 i don t even know if it s true of course _meta_end_dot_

 bush was caspable of great feats of stupidity even when rove worked there _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact remains that schip is a loser for the gop and only stubbornness and fear of bipartisan accomplishment prevents this bill from passing _meta_end_dot_

 a reminder to brain dead pundits this is a bipartisan and compromise bill _meta_end_dot_

 it passed senate and house by overwhelming majorities _meta_end_dot_

 labeling it as a democratic failure to compromise is just idiotic and as hatch and grassley will tell you it s more than just a democratic bill _meta_end_dot_

 now should legislation pass or a veto is overridden it still is not universal health care and there is still a health care battle on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 so be it _meta_end_dot_

 you have to take what you can get and move on _meta_end_dot_

 but until a schip bill is passed we are not moving on _meta_end_dot_
