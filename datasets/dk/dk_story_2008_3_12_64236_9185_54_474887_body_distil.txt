  yesterday the senate appropriations committee held a hearing on contractor waste fraud and corruption in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the testimony demonstrated not only that incompetence and greed have resulted in the wide scale theft of taxpayer money but also that the lack of accountability and corruption is directly tied to the instability in that country corruption and wasted taxpayer money in iraq is certainly not limited to american contractors _meta_end_dot_

 rather as congress submissively keeps sending billions upon billions into the black hole of unaccountability that is post invasion iraq it s become clear over the last several years that everyone and anyone in iraq is clamoring for cash _meta_end_dot_

 the tragic outrage of it all _meta_end_question_

 except for a hearing here and there on capitol hill under the leadership of president bush the american government doesn t seem to give a damn _meta_end_dot_

 last fall vanity fair published a must read article on the shocking incompetence which lead to the missing money the article is filled with outrageous anecdotes of waste fraud and corruption _meta_end_dot_

 some infuriating examples this is what retired admiral david oliver the c p a s director of management and budget had to say about what happened to the billions of dollars sent to iraq over the last few years stories about the greatest mishandling of taxpayer money n the history of the united states have peppered the media landscape _meta_end_dot_

 three years ago we learned that some _meta_dollor_ref_ billion were lost in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in may of _meta_number_ref_ it was reported that _meta_number_ref_ million dollars was missing worse case scenario someone took it home an official said _meta_end_dot_

 last fall some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion meant for the training of iraqi troops was reported unaccounted for about three months ago we learned that _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in military equipment was lost in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there are so many questions yet to be answered about who stole or misused american money in iraq and yesterday s hearing is good first start _meta_end_dot_

 how many billions have been lost _meta_end_question_

 were did they go _meta_end_question_

 why is this happening _meta_end_question_

 how can we prevent it in the future _meta_end_question_

 who should be held accountable _meta_end_question_

 but the greatest question of all how can congress in good conscience continue to appropriate billions for this mess _meta_end_question_

 how can congress continue to give this president blank checks which are being cashed in by the greedy the corrupt and the incompetent _meta_end_question_

 in short how can this government justify its irresponsible handling of taxpayer money _meta_end_question_

 the answer _meta_end_question_

 it can t _meta_end_dot_
