  not so very long ago there was a great deal of talk around various progressive parts of wwwland about how the half white half black barack obama had transcended race and racism _meta_end_dot_

 well actually not so much talk about that but rather talk about why talking about racism is by its very nature divisive _meta_end_dot_

 racism is divisive _meta_end_dot_

 however not talking about it doesn t make it go away _meta_end_dot_

 many people find straight up discussions of the subject uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 or irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 one expression i have heard for the past _meta_number_ref_ or so years from whites both friends and others goes along the lines of why do black people indians etc keep bringing up racial issues _meta_end_question_

 things are different now _meta_end_dot_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 in my lifetime progress has been made _meta_end_dot_

 but race and racism still factor greatly in the social cultural and political life of this nation _meta_end_dot_

 look at voter suppression _meta_end_dot_

 look at our prisons _meta_end_dot_

 homer plessy of the notorious plessy v _meta_end_dot_

 ferguson separate but equal case was actually seven eighths white one eight black _meta_end_dot_

 one of the claims his lawyers brought forth in his suit against louisiana was that state law deprived him of the property of his whiteness without due process _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court disagreed with him in a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ruling almost as terrible as the dred scot ruling of _meta_number_ref_ years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 a hundred and twenty five years ago after being heavily criticized by his enemies and many of his friends for choosing helen pitts as his second wife the ex slave abolitionist frederick douglass my no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hero put the whole matter into a perspective that too many americans still have not come to grips with my first wife was the color of my mother and my second wife the color of my father
