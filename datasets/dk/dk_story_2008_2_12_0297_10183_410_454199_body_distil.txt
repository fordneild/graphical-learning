  john edwards held a secret meeting on thursday with hillary clinton who somehow managed to fly in to chapel hill undetected by reporters _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday nbc abc and cnn reported that barack obama would travel to north carolina on monday to meet with edwards _meta_end_dot_

 however today it appears that meeting was cancelled or at least postponed _meta_end_dot_

 on saturday edwards met with advisers to discuss which candidate to endorse if any _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a few of the complications for edwards _meta_end_dot_

 although both clinton and obama have borrowed from his platform neither has demonstrated anything like edwards focus on working class issues _meta_end_dot_

 edwards appears to be looking for something like an iron clad guarantee that his issues won t be forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent spoke to an edwards aide who said that edwards _meta_end_dot_

 the horserace issues are complex as well _meta_end_dot_

 could edwards actually deliver votes reliably to either candidate _meta_end_question_

 for one thing many of edwards supporters have already migrated to the clinton or obama camps and it s far from clear how many of them edwards could break free again with an endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 besides that so far obama has not attracted much enthusiasm from working class voters whereas that s been an area of strength for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 thus what value would there be to an edwards endorsement against the demographic trend or for that matter with it _meta_end_question_

 or is the quest for edwards endorsement about chasing his _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_question_

 these are unlikely to be decisive in the end but who knows _meta_end_dot_

 right at the moment in any case they would be a modest boost for either candidate _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards waits too long then his delegate cache may turn out to be not quite as desireable _meta_end_dot_

 sargent s anonymous source says that edwards is more likely than not to endorse somebody _meta_end_dot_

 that suggests edwards recognizes that now is the time to exercise whatever influence he has _meta_end_dot_

 an endorsement won t achieve much though if edwards picks the loser _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt he believes he s in a position to engineer a winner so he may have to settle for ratifying one _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment with even clinton portraying herself as the underdog obama is looking increasingly like a winner _meta_end_dot_
