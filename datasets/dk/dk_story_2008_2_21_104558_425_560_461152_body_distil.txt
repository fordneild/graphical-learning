  it s full employment for wingnut mouthpieces this morning and the stores are sold out of flag lapel pins _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve got a suit and hankering to attack the media you can get yourself on tv this morning to say john mccain is innocent the new york times made it up because they re liberal _meta_end_dot_

 that s the game plan for day make the story about the times _meta_end_dot_

 your usual suspects limbaugh ingraham david brody what _meta_end_question_

 who rick davis what _meta_end_question_

 who _meta_end_question_

 oh his campaign manager greg mueller what _meta_end_question_

 who _meta_end_question_

 a theme is emerging and the grousing this morning is also just a bit comical in that it s all about how the times story is based at the moment on mostly unnamed sources _meta_end_dot_

 you ll recall of course that when source protection works in their favor republicans can t get enough of it _meta_end_dot_

 hey if it makes the nutters feel any better maybe we can just say the sources are a state secret and you ll just have to trust us on it _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_question_

 i thought not _meta_end_dot_

 whatever _meta_end_dot_

 the obvious play here is that it s not john mccain s fault or possibly his wang s but the times fault for reporting on it _meta_end_dot_

 the media as usual is in for the same kind of bullying and beating the congress has gotten from the bush administration for the last seven years _meta_end_dot_

 if you dare to do your job we will do our damnedest to make you afraid to get out of bed in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 oh and here s a bonus whine that made me chuckle what _meta_end_question_

 did someone we should know do something to john mccain in south carolina _meta_end_question_
