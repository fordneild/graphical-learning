  the new york times today reports on one of a batch of newly declassified documents from the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 the document in question a memo from then fbi director j _meta_end_dot_

 edgar hoover is dated july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ only two weeks after the outbreak of the korean war _meta_end_dot_

 hoover was angling for president truman s permission to implement a plan to suspend habeas corpus arrest thousands of citizens who were potentially dangerous hold them for an unspecified period and permit the attorney general to create special tribunals to decide whether to keep them imprisoned _meta_end_dot_

 hoover was hoping in other words for something close to a declaration of martial law _meta_end_dot_

 hoover goes on to describe an index of about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dangerous people nearly all citizens whom the fbi had been watching for some time since at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after these _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ potentially dangerous people were locked up without charge their dangerousness would be assessed by what are unmistakably kangaroo courts _meta_end_dot_

 it seems pretty clear that truman rejected hoover s plan or at least refused to give an order to implement it _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect it may be easy and certainly is pleasant to assume that such a hare brained scheme would go nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 but it s closer to the truth to say that it was far from inevitable during the summer of _meta_number_ref_ that the president would turn down this ridiculously unconstitutional scheme _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth pausing to consider how narrowly the nation avoided that fate _meta_end_dot_

 t ruman had had a spotty record on civil liberties for years _meta_end_dot_

 in march of _meta_number_ref_ for example he created governmental loyalty boards that inquired into the loyalty of all federal employees _meta_end_dot_

 these pernicious boards eventually got some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ federal workers fired and another _meta_number_ref_ or more employees resigned _meta_end_dot_

 it was one of several ugly marks against a president who was too ready to give ground to anti communist hysteria in congress and too willing to appease several hardliners among his own top officials such as his attorney general tom clark whom truman described as addicted to secret police proposition s _meta_end_dot_

 in creating these loyalty boards truman acted to pre empt the republican congress from legislating something even more abusive of civil liberties _meta_end_dot_

 truman also feared that something truly evil might be stirred up by hoover whom he loathed _meta_end_dot_

 truman told clark clifford on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that he wants to be sure and hold fbi down afraid of gestapo _meta_end_dot_

 truman believed rightly i think that hoover had assembled enough dirt on members of congress that they would give in to almost any of hoover s demands _meta_end_dot_

 in fact within hours of taking the oath of office in _meta_number_ref_ the president had his eye on the manipulative hoover hoover had sent over to the white house a young fbi agent from truman s home town to chat the new president up _meta_end_dot_

 so the background to this notorious decision from _meta_number_ref_ illustrates that truman far from indifferent to the bill of rights instead believed that he was fighting as best he could on its behalf _meta_end_dot_

 his profound skepticism of the fbi director was both a personal as well as a politically savvy judgment _meta_end_dot_

 for all his faults including cronyism occasional ineptitude stubbornness truman was at least a very sharp self reflective and principled man _meta_end_dot_

 such a person has the potential to rise above his times _meta_end_dot_

 t o return to hoover s plan in july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he was attempting to turn the military crisis on the korean peninsula to his own aggrandizement by introducing with little public notice a policy of illegal secret detentions and a separate secretive and illiberal court system under color of a national emergency _meta_end_dot_

 hoover was trying to achieve something like what dick cheney s gang did succeed in creating after september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today s nyt report by tim weiner draws attention to some of those parallels but it strikes a false note in setting the political context of truman s actions in point of fact truman did not sign the mccarran act in september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 quite the opposite he vetoed the bill and denounced it as unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 i quote from alonzo hamby s biography man of the people congress then overrode truman s veto and enacted what the american public quickly dubbed the concentration camp law _meta_end_dot_

 most of the mccarran act was subsequently ruled unconstitutional or repealed _meta_end_dot_

 in the long term truman emerged from this losing battle looking like a statesman _meta_end_dot_

 but in the heat of a mid term election with democrats facing unrelenting attacks from republicans for alleged weakness in rooting out subversives and having too few congressional allies willing to fight back against the nixonian mob it took political courage to veto the mccarran act _meta_end_dot_

 or was it principle or character that was required _meta_end_question_

 whatever the cause the country was fortunate to have a real leader when hoover s vicious scheme for destroying the writ of habeas corpus needed to be rebuffed _meta_end_dot_

 and whatever that trait is i m looking for it in the next president _meta_end_dot_

 i m searching for a candidate who can be trusted to take a firm line the next time the crazies try to pull a stunt like this _meta_end_dot_
