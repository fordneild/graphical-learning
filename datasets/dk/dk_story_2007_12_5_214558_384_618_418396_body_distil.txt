  i n grand new york under pale male s wing there lived a man who liked his bling with his wife he became bored so to the hamptons he would soar why not he cried i deserve to roam these funds may help the homeless true mere protocol would not deter his mistress preened her family purred c ourageously he seized that day and his wife thought him a jerk still he was not happy though a private place for a quick perk so a stately terror dome he built with a private room in which to snog but one day thunder shook the ground in tragedy and yet in death unbound o ur hero grim undaunted _meta_end_exclamation_

 look _meta_end_exclamation_

 as the city lifted voice in prayer our hero knew in smoke and din him and tried to stay on past his term _meta_end_dot_

 yes through tragedy and sordid spree the inverse of a kennedy what can my city do for me _meta_end_question_

 still there is just one more dream a place beyond the city lights a place past agencies coerced and power over the city s purse a nd so he dreams of his ascent how many more there are content
