  the fec this morning has certified the following amounts for matching payments to presidential candidates according to ken vogel i have no insight on how such loans work what kind of discount against the certified number you d be able to take out as a loan etc _meta_end_dot_

 but this relative early date for the certification because the fec s about to lose its quorum due to the von spakovsky block means that the candidates will have sufficient time to arrange the loans and start spending the proceeds in iowa though the projected future absence of a quorum casts in doubt whether future certifications will be possible _meta_end_dot_

 update vogel again
