  i m watching msnbc right now and i m completely baffled as to how they can predict delegates won by the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 we don t know what the delegates counts are for a state until all the votes in that state are counted _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans award delegate on a winner take all basis _meta_end_dot_

 if a state has x delegates and you win that state you get every one of the x delegates _meta_end_dot_

 democrat on the other hand award delegates on a proportional basis _meta_end_dot_

 until the votes are completely tallied we won t know the proportion of the votes won in a given state by hillary clinton and the proportion won in that state by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore about _meta_percent_ref_ of the pledged delegates awarded based on tonight s results will be parceled out by congressional district with the other _meta_percent_ref_ awarded proportionally based on the statewide totals _meta_end_dot_

 are any states completely done tallying the statewide totals and the congressional district by congressional district breakdowns _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 therefore it s impossible to know what the delegate count is _meta_end_dot_

 lesson to take away from this thumbnail sketch of our delegate process _meta_end_question_

 ignore the delegate count on television until all the votes from a state are tallied _meta_end_dot_
