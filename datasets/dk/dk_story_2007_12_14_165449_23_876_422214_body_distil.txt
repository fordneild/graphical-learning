  there s no good reason why democrats should stand idly by while sen _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid helps to push a terrible fisa bill through the senate early next week _meta_end_dot_

 it is sen _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller s bill granting retroactive immunity for telecoms a grant that reid admits is unwise and one he opposes but one reid has found parliamentary reasons for preferring over the better judiciary committee bill that excludes telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 and this despite the fact the house has passed a bill that excludes immunity _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sellout _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a pretty strange week for reid to be endorsing sen _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller s judgment _meta_end_dot_

 just a few days ago rockefeller revealed that he can t even remember what he was told and when about the cia s videotaping of torture sessions _meta_end_dot_

 this is the man whom reid wants us to follow off a cliff _meta_end_question_

 the senate needs to dump the rockefeller bill _meta_end_dot_

 we should leverage the outrage that many people feel about this betrayal and bring it to bear on the senate _meta_end_dot_

 there s more background here on the fisa scandal and here on what reid has done in leading with the worse rather than the better bill _meta_end_dot_

 it would be an understatement to describe rockefeller s bill as a disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 retroactive immunity for the telecoms is an appalling precedent as legislation _meta_end_dot_

 it also represents an abject surrender by the legislative branch to the right of the unitary executive to commit crimes and then legalize them ex post facto _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller s bill also will obstruct a current lawsuit against the telecoms that might otherwise succeed in extracting from the bush administration actual information about whom it is spying upon without warrant how where and why _meta_end_dot_

 the lawsuit threatens to expose the kind of information that congress so far has signally failed to get from the unitary president _meta_end_dot_

 that surely is why the bush administration is so determined that congress must grant retroactive immunity to the telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 the corporations would not need immunity if they had not broken the law and if they broke the law it was because they preferred to take orders from the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 i t s hard to escape the impression that bush is calling the tune here _meta_end_dot_

 notice that once again the senate is being rushed into an unnecessary vote _meta_end_dot_

 it is one of the bush administration s favorite tactics to hold back highly controversial bills and then bring them forward all in a rush and right before a major recess _meta_end_dot_

 that was exactly the way the appalling ppa bill which sunsets in february was pushed through this summer _meta_end_dot_

 reid recessed the senate before the house had even voted upon its own version of the bill forcing the house to accept the totality of the senate bill or leave town with no bill in place with bush hyping all manner of supposedly imminent threats of terrorist attacks _meta_end_dot_

 reid deserves a lot of blame for that fiasco _meta_end_dot_

 a similar game is afoot now _meta_end_dot_

 reid sat on the fisa bill for months _meta_end_dot_

 now with the christmas holiday fast approaching he rushes out in capitulation leading with the worse bill rockefeller s bill _meta_end_dot_

 does reid want to force the senate on its way out the door to swallow bush s demands for telecom immunity _meta_end_question_

 if not then this maneuver is inept in the extreme _meta_end_dot_

 t he stunt has to be blocked _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the best way to put sen _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid and the senate capitulators on the defensive is to use their fecklessness against them _meta_end_dot_

 the plan is this contact your senators and ask them to investigate whether or not the federal government has been surveilling you without a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 tell their office to take your name and address and ask how and when the senator will begin to investigate the matter _meta_end_dot_

 this is meant to drive home two points you don t need to give your senator any particular grounds for suspecting that the government is spying on you without a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the president stated he is proud of violating the fisa law is sufficient reason to want to know whether he is targeting you _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the senate is about to offer retroactive immunity to telecoms is sufficient evidence that somebody s rights have been violated _meta_end_dot_

 how do you know that it s not your rights _meta_end_question_

 more to the point if the senators don t know for a fact that your rights have not been violated then why are they proceeding with this bill _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t they wait to act until after they have gotten full information about the nature of the abuses _meta_end_question_

 why the rush to legalize those abuses _meta_end_question_

 tell your senators that you re not in a position to know anything about what the bush administration has been up to and ask them whether they are _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t know and of course they don t then they ought to explain why they re moving forward with this bill in ignorance of absolutely basic facts _meta_end_dot_

 what the senate is about to do is a national disgrace and this is a straightforward way to nail that point down _meta_end_dot_

 y ou can be certain that senate offices will not want to receive any requests like this _meta_end_dot_

 i speak from experience _meta_end_dot_

 late in _meta_number_ref_ i wrote to arlen specter s chief of staff bill reynolds about the fisa scandal and asked him if specter s office was prepared to investigate whether i had been spied on illegally by the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 reynolds was taken aback _meta_end_dot_

 sure he said we can investigate that if you want but it s going to tie up our resources _meta_end_dot_

 what if every one of his constituents asked the senator to investigate on their behalf _meta_end_question_

 and indeed that s the point _meta_end_dot_

 what if every concerned american did ask the very reasonable question is my government spying on me illegally i don t think the senate can handle that question _meta_end_dot_

 senator specter couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 nearly two years later his office still hasn t told me anything _meta_end_dot_

 s o inundate the senate on monday with calls and emails about the fisa bill that will be going up for a vote _meta_end_dot_

 and don t hesitate to demand to know whether your senator knows how many and which residents of your state have been surveilled without warrant by this administration _meta_end_dot_

 they ve had two years to figure that out _meta_end_dot_

 what do you want to bet they can t answer such questions _meta_end_question_

 here is a gateway for contact information for all senators _meta_end_dot_

 if your senator is a democrat mention that the major presidential candidates have come out against the rockefeller bill and in favor of a filibuster of any bill that grants retroactive immunity _meta_end_dot_

 and don t forget to contact the presidential candidates to let them know you expect them to abide by their promise to fight retroactive immunity for telecoms _meta_end_dot_
