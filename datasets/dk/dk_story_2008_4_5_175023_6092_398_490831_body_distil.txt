  despite the all too often discouraging statistics sometimes they do it right _meta_end_dot_

 on national security and intelligence matters i ve found myself increasingly relying on cq _meta_end_dot_

 today the national security editor jeff stein looks at another aspect of the yoo torture memo that has received scant attention _meta_end_dot_

 there have been reports of detainees being sedated and jose padilla s attorney argued in a motion last year that padilla had been drugged with something possibly lsd during his interrogations _meta_end_dot_

 but hard evidence has yet to surface and if it has happened it s probably been done under highly classified programs _meta_end_dot_

 meaning we may never know for certain the full extent of what was done in the name of national security _meta_end_dot_

 the yoo memos and there is still the october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ memo the one in which the olc concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations that hasn t yet been released provide a critical an nauseating window into how this administration restructured our legal system to fit the cheney vision of a unitary executive _meta_end_dot_

 given how much of what yoo laid out in the memos we ve seen was enacted by the administration it seems a pretty safe bet that drugging detainess was on the list too _meta_end_dot_

 here s yet another reason for congress to as marty lederman has argued put a moratorium on considering any administration legislative proposals until all of the memos have been disclosed and appropriately repudiated by the department of justice that goes doubly for fisa _meta_end_dot_
