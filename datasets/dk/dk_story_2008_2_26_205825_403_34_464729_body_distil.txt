  russert is being an ass and he is without question making things harder for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 case in point on the question about whether they would withdraw completely from iraq if the iraqi government asked he gave obama time to answer but interrupted clinton very quickly _meta_end_dot_

 it s a noticeable difference in treatment _meta_end_dot_

 that said the fact that she is also consistently going after obama makes her problems with the moderators look like her aggression when i think it s more a combination of the two factors _meta_end_dot_
