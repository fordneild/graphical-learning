  at last week s conservative political action conference republican bloggers held forth on why their efforts at making waves in the cyberpond have so far amounted to no more than feeble ripples _meta_end_dot_

 what got the blame _meta_end_question_

 see we re making _meta_number_ref_ million hits a month because you re all a bunch of baby killing loafers while republicans are far too busy to chat _meta_end_dot_

 it makes you wonder why erickson even tries _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t possibly be that they ve spent their time online acting as apologists for disaster that their discussion is as exciting as the stage guests at a john mccain rally and that the ideas they re selling are the same ones that have failed spectacularly for _meta_end_dot_

 well ever _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t possibly be that what they came to sell cpac their wonderful gop _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is nothing more than clumsy immitation of what liberal bloggers have been doing for years _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait maybe it could _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i ve misunderstood all these years but when something won t sell isn t it usally the product that s at fault _meta_end_question_
