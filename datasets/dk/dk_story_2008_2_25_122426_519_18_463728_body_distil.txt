  from the diaries kos update the matchless emptywheel fleshes out her skepticism at firedoglake _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the rebroadcast on the local news picked up only a segment of the _meta_number_ref_ minutes broadcast and so omitted the part of the story that detailed plans to intentionally use the federal justice system to take out a political rival update _meta_number_ref_ the segment was apparently was rebroadcast in full on the affiliate newscast _meta_end_dot_

 apologies for the misreading the _meta_number_ref_ minutes siegelman blackout story in alabama has evolved since aggressiveprogressive s diary last night _meta_end_dot_

 because ap s diary has fallen off the recommend list i thought i would provide the update in diary format to encourage further research and action on the part of the board _meta_end_dot_
