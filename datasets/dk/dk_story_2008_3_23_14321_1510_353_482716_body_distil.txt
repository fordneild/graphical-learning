  it s just beyond me why more congressional democrats have not seized upon real id as an issue that could split the republican party down the middle _meta_end_dot_

 from almost every perspective the _meta_number_ref_ real id act is reprehensible _meta_end_dot_

 its most obnoxious component creates in effect a national id card by imposing draconian restrictions upon how states may issue drivers licenses _meta_end_dot_

 it requires the states to conduct expensive and essentially impossible background checks and create and share databases with extensive personal information for all drivers _meta_end_dot_

 it also requires that airline passengers and anyone seeking to enter a federal building in the future must present a real id or face extensive screening and delays _meta_end_dot_

 there s every reason to believe that in the not too distant future the uses of this nascent national id card would be extended both in public and private spheres until it became nearly impossible to do without one _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the state databases would almost certainly be fed into federal systems including data mining programs like total information awareness or whatever the government is calling its orwellian program now _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to believe as well that these vast state databases could be kept secure from snoopers and identity thieves when so many low level employees will have direct daily access to them _meta_end_dot_

 real id is a nightmarishly bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 drafted by the slightly daft james sensenbrenner and inserted in the conference report for a must pass emergency appropriation bill for tsunami relief real id was enacted without debate without hearings without input from democrats _meta_end_dot_

 like the patriot act also rushed through in an underhanded and undemocratic way real id gives the federal government sweeping powers some of them apparently unconstitutional while suppressing the means to resist it _meta_end_dot_

 for example real id has a provision stripping courts of jurisdiction in any federal seizure of private land in the vicinity of national borders for vaguely defined security purposes _meta_end_dot_

 real id is opposed fervently by voters and interest groups across the political spectrum especially among liberals and libertarians but also many small government and states rights conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 it s constituency consists mainly of sensenbrenner michael chertoff the heritage foundation neocon bedwetters and the extreme fringes of the anti immigrant booboisie _meta_end_dot_

 it s widely resented in nearly every corner of the country especially in western states where democrats are positioned to capitalize on growing resentment of republican arrogance and abuse of power _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 schweitzer of montana has told the federal government it can go to hell as far as pushing real id on his state _meta_end_dot_

 very few states are even remotely eager to implement the id requirements if only because they amount to a hefty unfunded mandate _meta_end_dot_

 the real id act also represents a direct challenge to the states co equal status with the federal government as enshrined in the tenth amendment _meta_end_dot_

 fully _meta_number_ref_ state legislatures have passed bills or resolutions opposing real id ar co ga hi id il me mi mo mt ne nv nh nd ok sc tn ut and wa _meta_end_dot_

 most of the remaining states are considering similar proposals _meta_end_dot_

 indeed arizona is on the verge of joining the states resisting real id that could cause john mccain some embarrassment this year _meta_end_dot_

 of the presidential candidates only mccain backs this boondoggle whereas barack obama strongly opposes it _meta_end_dot_

 opposition makes good politics across the country _meta_end_dot_

 for example of real id s critics on capitol hill few are more prominent than tom allen _meta_end_dot_

 if enacted his bill to repeal real id h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ could give allen a major boost in his senate race in maine the state that has led the national opposition to the act _meta_end_dot_

 yet depressingly allen s bill is stalled in the house subcommittee on government management organization and procurement where it was referred one year ago today _meta_end_dot_

 this is just another instance in which democrats are handed an emotive issue to belabor the republican party with _meta_end_dot_

 it s an issue dear to democrats at the state level around the country one that could solidify support among independents while fracturing the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 it could help to revolutionize the image of the democratic party as a bulwark of individual rights _meta_end_dot_

 and yet democrats in congress sniff and turn away almost as if the issue were beneath them _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the bush administration has shown again and again that it s desperate to avoid being cornered on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 dhs has quietly abandoned some of the law s more onerous requirements and twice postponed the implementation of real id _meta_end_dot_

 this january s final rule allows states to push the first phase of implementation back until _meta_number_ref_ as long as they submit a written request for an extension to dhs by march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 except that several states including maine and south carolina have declined to request an extension _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire sent dhs a letter that was rejected as insufficiently submissive _meta_end_dot_

 something remarkable happened this week when montana refused to ask for an extension _meta_end_dot_

 the response from dhs was to give montana an extension anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear that dhs backed down from a confrontation it knows it cannot win _meta_end_dot_

 the ap adds the deadline this month and dhs absurd threat to disrupt airline screening for passengers from non compliant states is causing even more states to think about standing up to chertoff _meta_end_dot_

 california is now edging in that direction sending in a letter that pointedly refrains from declaring that it will implement real id _meta_end_dot_

 and just as quickly dhs is trying to sweep the confrontation under the carpet _meta_end_dot_

 for the bush administration then it s about saving face _meta_end_dot_

 now is the time for democrats to go on the offensive on real id _meta_end_dot_

 the cracks have already appeared in the wall why not drive home the wedge _meta_end_question_

 i d urge you to contact the democratic members of the house government management organization and procurement subcommittee and ask them to move on tom allen s bill to repeal real id h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ edolphus towns chairman paul e _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski christopher s _meta_end_dot_

 murphy peter welch a co sponsor of the bill carolyn b _meta_end_dot_

 maloney update here are some good recent diaries about real id on susan collins attempt to stem opposition to it in maine by aclu on rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom allen s bill in congress by spud_meta_number_ref_ and on gov _meta_end_dot_
