  plenty of exciting news in house races over the past few days _meta_end_dot_

 al _meta_number_ref_ montgomery mayor bobby bright intends to run as a democrat for the vacant second district seat in alabama currently held by retiring republican terry everett _meta_end_dot_

 the dccc and alabama democrats have been recruiting bright to run for months as he is probably one of the only democrats who could make a competitive race in this blood red district _meta_end_dot_

 how red _meta_end_question_

 bush received _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote here against john kerry and it is more strongly republican than all but four democratic held districts there s an argument to be made that it s actually more republican than tx _meta_number_ref_ which has a slightly higher pvi _meta_end_dot_

 now it must be said that bobby bright is not exactly a liberal lion _meta_end_dot_

 he considered running as a republican in this race and he identifies himself as a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 still this is about as red as districts get so there s something to be said for having any kind of serious candidate here _meta_end_dot_

 nv _meta_number_ref_ nevada democratic party chairwoman jill derby will run again she lost a close race in _meta_number_ref_ against now rep _meta_end_dot_

 dean heller _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would take a near miracle for a democrat to win this r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seat but derby nearly pulled it off last cycle _meta_end_dot_

 this won t be a top tier race but it certainly bears watching _meta_end_dot_

 ut _meta_number_ref_ usually the entry of a young well funded and well connected republican challenger to a popular democratic incumbent in a blood red utah district would not exactly thrill me _meta_end_dot_

 but i will make an exception for josh son of mitt romney who is mulling a challenge to utah s lone democratic representative the well respected jim matheson _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to bruinkid who diaried this at swing state project _meta_end_dot_

 i felt rather cheated at the mittster s uninspiring performance in the republican primary this year _meta_end_dot_

 i had so hoped to have my former governor around through november so that i could continue firing snarky broadsides at him from the internet they don t make much easier targets than the mittster as you know _meta_end_dot_

 so the prospective entry of another romney into the race he hasn t decided yet and better yet the prospect of willard campaigning for him is positively thrilling for me _meta_end_dot_

 getting serious for a moment josh romney s name and money would make him a serious candidate in this race and put it on the list of potential republican pickup opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 still matheson is very well liked in the district and throughout the state in fact so he would still be favored in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 unless you know the romneys let the dogs out _meta_end_dot_

 mi _meta_number_ref_ nancy skinner has dropped out of the race for the democratic nomination to face rep _meta_end_dot_

 joe knollenberg which clears the field for former state senator and lottery commissioner gary peters _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very promising race as peters is a strong candidate and the district is about as purple as they come with an almost perfectly neutral pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 peters won the district in fact in his _meta_number_ref_ race for michigan attorney general a race he lost statewide by less than a fifth of a point to republican mike cox _meta_end_dot_

 i wish the best for nancy skinner who ran a surprisingly close race against knollenberg in _meta_number_ref_ in whatever she chooses to do _meta_end_dot_

 ny _meta_number_ref_ looks like jack davis fast approaching perennial candidate status is going to run in the democratic primary to face rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom reynolds _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_

 after failed runs in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s joined in the primary by attorney alice kryzan and a _meta_number_ref_ year old iraq war veteran and yearly kos attendee named jon powers _meta_end_dot_

 davis has plenty of money so this primary could get expensive and maybe quite divisive _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day i can t believe the good people of ny _meta_number_ref_ or any other district for that matter could possibly vote against anyone named jon powers _meta_end_dot_

 il _meta_number_ref_ the republican candidate for this republican held open seat new lenox mayor tim baldermann has dropped out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 apparently he hated calling up people he didn t know and asking them for money _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like he actually had a conscience so it is perhaps not surprising he didn t care much for a congressional campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the republican county chairmen in the district will select a replacement who will have their hands full in this swing district with democrat debbie halvorson _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a great fan of her website but she s a fine candidate and she s in a commanding position now with the republicans top choice out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 az _meta_number_ref_ embattled rep _meta_end_dot_

 rick renzi is defiant to the last _meta_end_dot_

 he won t resign despite the most fervent wishes of minority leader john boehner and nrcc chairman tom cole who no doubt remember the devastating effect the culture of corruption meme had on their electoral fortunes in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately arizona republicans will get to enjoy renzi s taint for many more months and that s a good thing in a state with four competitive house races _meta_end_dot_

 update i mistakenly identified alice kryzan as a former republican _meta_end_dot_

 as the maven points out she is not _meta_end_dot_

 i ve edited to reflect this _meta_end_dot_
