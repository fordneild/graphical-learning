  plenty has and will continue to be written about john mccain s problems with movement conservatives and the heart of the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 there s plenty more to talk about and we ll continue to pop popcorn and watch the republican party fight multiple wars such as movement conservatives vs pragmatists economic and anti tax conservatives vs social conservatives neocon imperialists vs paleocon isolationists and pro corporate lovers of cheap labor vs nativists who want to deport _meta_number_ref_ million illegal workers _meta_end_dot_

 but today the day after super tuesday let s look at some election results that indicate just how weak a hold likely republican nominee has over his own party s base _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has garnered more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in only _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_dot_

 if you take out arizona where he only managed to get _meta_percent_ref_ compared to the home state totals of _meta_percent_ref_ for obama _meta_percent_ref_ for huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ for clinton plus _meta_percent_ref_ in ar and _meta_percent_ref_ for romney the only place where mccain has gotten more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote are states that have voted democratic in presidential elections going back at least to _meta_number_ref_ ca ct de il ma nj and ny _meta_end_dot_

 of course even for the republicans with their winner take all allocation of delegates which in some places award delegates by statewide totals while in others delegates are awarded by congressional district it s the delegate count that matters _meta_end_dot_

 if we assume that the republican s geographic base is in those states where they ve consistently won electoral votes and the swing states that have been contested by tipped to the republicans we see further weakness for mccain in the delegate counts _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans contested _meta_number_ref_ states yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 according to the figures at real clear politics there were _meta_number_ref_ delegates up for grabs _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain had a big day winning according to rcc s calculations _meta_number_ref_ of those delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but look where he won them _meta_end_dot_

 if we count ar co mo and wv as swing states there were _meta_number_ref_ delegates available in the democratic states _meta_number_ref_ in the republican states and _meta_number_ref_ in the swing states _meta_end_dot_

 because of his narrow win in mo mccain ended up with _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates from swing states _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee got _meta_percent_ref_ and romney the remaining _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the republican states they split very evenly _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and huckabee each took _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates from republican states with romney not far behind with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 where mccain racked up his huge delegate lead was in the democratic states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ delegates from solid democratic states _meta_percent_ref_ went to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney snagged the remaining _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 romney s delegates came from states across the spectrum of republican to democratic _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of his delegates came from democratic states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of his delegates are from republican states and the remaining _meta_percent_ref_ are from swing states _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee won two swing states his home state of ar and with the caucus help of the mccain forces wv _meta_end_dot_

 those _meta_percent_ref_ account for _meta_percent_ref_ of his total _meta_end_dot_

 the remaning _meta_percent_ref_ of his delegates come from reliably republican states in the south _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is in command of the delegate race because a disproportionate number of his delegates come from states he has almost no hope of winning in november _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to his very narrow win in mo _meta_percent_ref_ of his delegates come from swing states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of his delegates are from republican states with close to half of those delegates coming from his home state _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates mccain picked up yesterday are from democratic states _meta_end_dot_

 it seems apparent that huckabee is killing romney s chances and probably vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 there s been plenty of chatter from reporters that all of the republican candidates hate really hate mittens _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that huckabee is doing a blocking move to keep romney from getting the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for republicans is that the beneficiary of huckabee s maneuvers is someone the republican base doesn t much like _meta_end_dot_

 a quick glance at who s winning our primaries and caucuses shows a competitive race across the board _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton won some big democratic states like ca ma and nj _meta_end_dot_

 but barack obama also won some solidly democratic states like ct de and mn _meta_end_dot_

 they fought close battles in battleground states like mo and nm _meta_end_dot_

 and they both posted big wins in solidly republican states like al and ok _meta_end_dot_

 a comparable scenario on our side would be a three way race where two candidates beat each other in the battles for il and ny nj and ct mn and ma while a third candidate wins the nomination by getting huge numbers of delegates from al and ak id and ks nd and ok _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic base probably wouldn t be likely to embrace a candidate who couldn t ever get more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in states with large numbers of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not surprising the republican base is unhappy that their nominee is likely to be a guy who can t win in any states with a lot of republicans that the gop has any chance of winning in a competitive election _meta_end_dot_
