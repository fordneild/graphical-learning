  the traditional media gets a lot of knocks in the blogosphere these days _meta_end_dot_

 but they bring much of it on themselves with their endless complicity in serving a far right wing agenda _meta_end_dot_

 glenn greenwald has a new book coming out soon which takes this on directly what better place to start exposing the right wing media infestation than the washington times _meta_end_question_

 this newspaper was founded in _meta_number_ref_ by cult leader sun myung moon and his second in command bo hi pak _meta_end_dot_

 it has lost about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to date and according to the wikipedia is only still in business because of a subsidy from news world communications inc described by the columbia journalism review as the media arm of reverend sun myung moon s unification church as business ventures go a three billion dollar loss doesn t appear terribly attractive so much for that free market conservative magic huh _meta_end_dot_

 but as a propaganda appendage of the moonie gop empire it s worth every penny _meta_end_dot_

 here s just a few of their greatest hits courtesy of john gorenfeld and his new book chronicling moon s antics bad moon rising based on past performance it s a fair bet that the washington moonie times will publish more negative nonsense this election cycle and that those hypothetical fabrications will then be magnified by wingnut hate radio and neocon bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 what is unknown is why otherwise legitimate media venues continue to enable the media appendage of an ultra conservative cult leader with a national credible platform without so much as a ticker to viewers that it s coming from a paper controlled by whacked out extremist right wing religious maniac who has proclaimed himself the messiah and claims to channel dead american presidents _meta_end_dot_

 if and when the next political hit piece does appear in the moonie times how will the traditional media react _meta_end_question_

 will they once again fall into that comfortable familiar trap _meta_end_question_

 or will they finally this time not play the helpful fool and instead turn and do a story on the washington times agenda in pushing moonie bullshit _meta_end_question_

 we ll know soon enough if the times really are a changin _meta_end_dot_
