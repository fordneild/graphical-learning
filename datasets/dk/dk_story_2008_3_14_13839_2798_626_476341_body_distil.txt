  well ok not really secrets since there s no way we could know what was discussed because it was um secret but steny hoyer did have this to say upon the session s end because there was no new information to be had _meta_end_dot_

 the house leadership called the republicans bluff they probably called for the damned thing thinking the dems would reject it and then they would have some great tool to use against them in the debate _meta_end_dot_

 i can just hear them now not all the secret information was heard it s irresponsible of them to go forward with this vote well leadership let the republicans have their little session even though they admitted on the house floor in the debate leading to the session that they had no new info _meta_end_dot_

 they were left standing there holding the bag just creating one more obstruction _meta_end_dot_

 funny way for them to behave considering how dangerous they say it is for the nation to go one more day without resolution of the fisa issue _meta_end_dot_

 almost enough to make one doubt their sincerity no _meta_end_question_
