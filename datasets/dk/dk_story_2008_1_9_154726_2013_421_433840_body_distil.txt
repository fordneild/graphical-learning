  in my first regular column for the hill i introduce dc to the concept of concern trolling which is quite the fad in gop circles _meta_end_dot_

 it really is amazing that in this day and age democrats are still unable to identify and dismiss concern trolling from its enemies _meta_end_dot_

 it s a skill they need to learn if they are to become a more effective and fearless governing party _meta_end_dot_
