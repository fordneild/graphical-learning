  watching the presidential campaign of john mccain brings to mind the old expression that says when you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas _meta_end_dot_

 or in mccain s case when you lie down with religious lunatics don t be surprised when the other religious lunatics that you re pandering to turn on you _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that mccain s proud acceptance of the endorsement of john the catholic church is the great whore hagee has upset bill hollywood is controlled by secular jews who hate christianity donohue _meta_end_dot_

 it s the ultimate rightwing cage match the battle of the bigots fighting for the soul of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 what s an episcopalian baptist to do _meta_end_question_

 so far maverick mccain is refusing to reject or denounce instead going with his patented talking out both sides of his mouth straight talk saying that hagee you can almost feel the media swooning _meta_end_dot_

 but after they recover and if they are done deciding whether or not barack obama s rejection and denouncement of louis farrakhan was enough perhaps they could ask john mccain for some clarification _meta_end_dot_

 their questions could go something like this in other words while hagee and donohue duke it out over who is going to hell faster can we find out which beliefs of hagee are the ones that senator straight talk stands for and believes in _meta_end_question_
