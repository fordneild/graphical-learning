  renowned ex liberal mitt romney bleeding support in iowa and new hampshire as unsatisfied republicans continue to grope around in the dark for their next great white hope has come out swinging against a suddenly resurgent john mccain i find it especially interesting that romney invokes the grading system in reagan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i never took the class myself opting instead to take us history _meta_number_ref_ it s always clinton s fault _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to believe that romney himself surely failed introductory reagan given that he disavowed the legacy of reagan bush when campaigning in _meta_number_ref_ taking particular pains to underscore the fact that he was an independent during the _meta_number_ref_s not a reagan republican _meta_end_dot_

 here s a classic ad from the log cabin republicans from romney s u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate campaign pretty nice ad no _meta_end_question_

 i love it _meta_end_dot_

 for years he s fought conservatives massachusetts values i don t line up with the nra _meta_end_dot_

 fabulous stuff _meta_end_dot_

 but i think is my favorite part _meta_end_dot_

 straight from the horse s mouth too _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth remembering too that when reagan s handpicked successor george bush the elder was on the ballot in _meta_number_ref_ romney opted to vote in the democratic primary for paul tsongas _meta_end_dot_

 he also donated that year to three democrats dick swett john lafalce and utah senate candidate doug anderson _meta_end_dot_

 so i m having a very tough time accepting mitt romney as a committed reaganite _meta_end_dot_

 so apparently are others _meta_end_dot_

 s eriously though practically every candidate particularly those with presidential aspirations will adapt his or her campaign rhetoric to some degree in order to better appeal to the electorate almost everyone will show some willingness to move on some key issues in order to maximize their electoral viability _meta_end_dot_

 that s standard operating procedure _meta_end_dot_

 we know that _meta_end_dot_

 but i do not think i have ever seen a candidate who has moved so far so quickly so shamelessly and so cynically across the political spectrum as mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i say cynically because that s what it is it should be painfully obvious to anyone with clear political vision that romney s political conversion was borne out of nothing so much as pure calculation _meta_end_dot_

 he thought he could win as a conservative so he became one _meta_end_dot_

 if he thought he could win as a pirate he would have become a pirate _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that conservatives know in their heart of hearts that romney is not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 it is why romney despite all his advantages has still not been able to break out of the republican field and why romney is still in grave danger of losing the nomination to mccain or huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 yet a good portion of the republican electorate it seems is perfectly willing to forget all about mitt romney _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and mitt romney _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paying attention solely to the handsome guy in front of them who says all the right things _meta_end_dot_

 they ll buy the new romney _meta_end_dot_

 they ll buy his bullshit about his conservative come to reagan moment of revelation because they really do hate all their other options that much _meta_end_dot_

 it s striking to see their conservative purity has painted them into a corner where nobody is acceptable everybody s compromised for some reason so the only option left is to take a telegenic guy ignore practically everything he has done or said in public life and delude themselves into thinking he is one of them _meta_end_dot_

 this is not surprising given that the republican party has based its political coalition on fear and deception it was perhaps inevitable that there would come a time when they were forced to deceive themselves into embracing a thoroughly compromised and undesirable candidate based on their own frenzied fear of hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps huckabee or mccain will win the nomination they are teaming up to get rid of romney and the republicans willful ignorance and self delusion will not be so starkly obvious _meta_end_dot_

 but if mitt romney does wind up as the gop candidate it will be an immensely revealing election for those who had the gall to deride john kerry as a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_
