  crazy jack davis who couldn t be bothered to campaign last year and lost what should ve been a victory against republican tom reynolds is now showing that he isn t just crazy he s delusional as well _meta_end_dot_

 yup _meta_end_dot_

 according to davis millionaires are at a disadvantage because they can t swamp their peon challengers with an avalanche of self provided greenbacks _meta_end_dot_

 where did i place that tiny violin _meta_end_question_

 the funny thing is that there is no incumbent in this race _meta_end_dot_

 maybe davis doesn t realize it but reynolds has announced his retirement _meta_end_dot_

 this is an open seat _meta_end_dot_

 so davis is fighting for an advantage not against an incumbent but against his democratic primary challenger and the non incumbent republican candidate in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 next he ll sue against the advantages enjoyed by candidates who actually get off their lazy asses and campaign and meet voters _meta_end_dot_

 that s so like totally unfair to lazy ass bat shit insane gazillionaires _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not all _meta_end_exclamation_

 with jack davis you always get an extra helping of crazy jon powers served his nation in uniform fought in iraq and is now a public school social studies teacher _meta_end_dot_

 apparently those aren t real jobs to davis _meta_end_dot_
