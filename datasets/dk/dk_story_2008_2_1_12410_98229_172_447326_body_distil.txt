  in the non existent wake of the non existent excitement over the non existent clamor for a bloomberg candidacy comes this piece of news about the equally deluded numbskulls at the too hopefully named third way truthout org reports here s the deal mr _meta_end_dot_

 and ms _meta_end_dot_

 media if you ever find yourself forced to cover third way there is no third way _meta_end_dot_

 especially not on a legislative issue like this one _meta_end_dot_

 there is aye there is nay and that s all _meta_end_dot_

 the mythical third way is just a second excuse for voting for one of the first two ways _meta_end_dot_

 observe see _meta_end_question_

 that s not a third way _meta_end_dot_

 it s the first way _meta_end_dot_

 get it _meta_end_question_

 easy as pie _meta_end_dot_

 i know you can do this _meta_end_exclamation_

 yes they have a flag motif in their logo _meta_end_dot_

 yes they cater luncheons and hand out binders with attractively printed covers bearing that flag motif logo _meta_end_dot_

 and that s got to seem really really serious _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like all the other stuff you ve seen that actually is serious right _meta_end_question_

 but really _meta_end_dot_

 there is no third way _meta_end_dot_

 you can continue to enjoy their free lunches i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 it s up to you _meta_end_dot_

 i don t begrudge anyone a free lunch now and again _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if you have trouble remembering this lesson think of it in terms of the lunches _meta_end_dot_

 you can either eat them or not eat them _meta_end_dot_

 but there s no third option _meta_end_dot_

 easy _meta_end_dot_

 there _meta_end_dot_

 is _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 third _meta_end_dot_

 way _meta_end_dot_
