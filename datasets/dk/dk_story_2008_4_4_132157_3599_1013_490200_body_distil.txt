  john mccain voted against the martin luther king holiday in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 asked about today he made a startling revelation mccain was _meta_number_ref_ when king died _meta_end_dot_

 he was _meta_number_ref_ when he voted against the holiday _meta_end_dot_

 he claims he didn t know about mlk that entire time _meta_end_question_

 that it was merely an issue _meta_end_question_

 the reporter is right this wasn t an issue it was basic knowledge of american history _meta_end_dot_

 yet even at _meta_number_ref_ mccain still had a lot of learning to do before he d change his mind on mlk as steve benen notes now mccain claims he fought his own governor benen who i trust more says he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 so does abc news jake tapper so he s a liar _meta_end_dot_

 and worse than that it speaks volumes that he considers mlk not a giant of american and world history but an issue _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure mccain trent lott and george allen would all agree on that _meta_end_dot_
