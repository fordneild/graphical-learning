  let me answer some feedback on the mitt for michigan campaign we ve started here _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ this isn t a pro romney effort _meta_end_dot_

 we re not saying romney is the best of their lot _meta_end_dot_

 now granted romney is pretty much anything to everyone the guy has no core principles and he ll sell out his kids the way he s selling out their inheritance in a heartbeat if it meant a few more votes _meta_end_dot_

 his record makes that clear _meta_end_dot_

 so who knows what he believes _meta_end_question_

 i doubt he himself knows _meta_end_dot_

 but that s irrelevant to this effort _meta_end_dot_

 we re also not saying romney is the best candidate to run against _meta_end_dot_

 he probably is but any electability argument is fraught with danger _meta_end_dot_

 so we re not supporting romney because he polls shittiest of all the republican candidates in head to head matchups _meta_end_dot_

 those numbers could quickly change _meta_end_dot_

 nope we re pushing romney because at the end of the day romney is spending a lot of money on ads trashing his fellow republicans _meta_end_dot_

 we want more of that money spent trashing his fellow republicans _meta_end_dot_

 we want an unsettled field with republicans fragmented and fighting _meta_end_dot_

 we want the theocons huckabee the neocons mccain and the corportate cons romney to maintain viable top tier candidates in the race for as long as possible since it fuels their civil war _meta_end_dot_

 heck if we truly hit the jackpot we might even get a brokered gop convention _meta_end_dot_

 to summarize this isn t a vote for romney _meta_end_dot_

 it s a vote for clusterfuck _meta_end_dot_

 and by sowing doubts about the validity of any theoretical romney victory especially a close one we also pollute his victory _meta_end_dot_

 so even if romney wins he loses _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the democratic race is irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to say it to michigan democrats but your governor miscalculated and now the democratic race means zero _meta_end_dot_

 the anti hillary clinton camp thinks if they can keep her under _meta_number_ref_ percent by voting undeclared that they ll notch some sort of victory _meta_end_dot_

 no one will care _meta_end_dot_

 you can t even say more than half of democrats don t want her since less than half of democrats wanted her in iowa or new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that less than half of democrats want any of our candidates right now in the three way race _meta_end_dot_

 i wish it wasn t the case _meta_end_dot_

 and if the primary had been placed on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it would ve mattered _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 so now the only story that will emerge from michigan will be the republican results and that s the only place democrats can materially affect the race _meta_end_dot_

 to summarize this is about letting democrats actually materially impact this race _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ you can t bring a spork to a gun battle _meta_end_dot_

 there are some concerned that this is dirty tricks and that we shouldn t stoop to their level _meta_end_dot_

 this is perhaps the key difference between traditional liberals and movement progressives _meta_end_dot_

 the former believe that politics is a high minded debate about ideas the latter have seen movement conservatives use every tool at their disposal to steal power and cling to it _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is politics matter and so does the winner of elections _meta_end_dot_

 you can t bring a spork to a gun fight because like florida _meta_number_ref_ we lose every time _meta_end_dot_

 and while some may feel proud their personal ethics weren t compromised and that we took the high road through the recount battle how many thousands of soldiers and iraqis wish that democrats had fought a little harder for gore s victory _meta_end_question_

 there is one major difference between movement progressives and conservatives we won t cross the line into illegal behavior _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as we operate within legal boundaries all s fair in politics _meta_end_dot_

 the stakes matter too much to unilaterally disarm _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ open primaries are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 should we be meddling in their primary _meta_end_question_

 to be honest open primaries like this michigan one are ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i m concerned if someone isn t a democrat they shouldn t get to decide my party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 if someone isn t a republican they shouldn t get to decide the republican s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 so if this little campaign adds impetus for closing primaries so much the better _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as the law allows crossover voting there is nothing wrong with picking up the ballot you think best helps your candidate _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the best way to help the democrats if you are a democrat isn t to pick up the democratic ballot it s picking up the republican one and voting for chaos and war within their caucus _meta_end_dot_

 update are you on facebook _meta_end_question_

 join the democrats for mitt group _meta_end_dot_
