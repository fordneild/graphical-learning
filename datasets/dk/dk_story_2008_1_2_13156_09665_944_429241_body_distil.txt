  momentum against the iowa first in the nation caucus is sure to explode after thursday as many people get their first real close up look at its undemocratic nature _meta_end_dot_

 first a look at how the caucuses work so what does this mean in practical terms _meta_end_question_

 nope cpt _meta_end_dot_

 huffman is out of luck _meta_end_dot_

 as are these folks and the iowa democratic party response to what is a hideous way to conduct an election _meta_end_question_

 what an elitist asshole _meta_end_dot_

 yet this ridiculous process he defends will disenfranchises thousands of iowans as it disenfranchises millions of voters around the country who would like a chance to vote for their favorite primary candidate but will never get the chance _meta_end_dot_

 there s an entire nation out there _meta_number_ref_ states plus d c _meta_end_dot_

 who have tired of this ridiculous calendar and undemocratic way of choosing our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 iowa and new hampshire will fight like hell to retain their lofty status it s worth prestige points and a crapload of money for those states _meta_end_dot_

 but no matter what those states may think they don t have a god given right to hold our nomination process hostage to their whims and parochial concerns like ethanol _meta_end_dot_

 they should enjoy these next two weeks because this is likely their swan song _meta_end_dot_
