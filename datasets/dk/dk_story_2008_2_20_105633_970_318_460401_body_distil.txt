  this was very much how it was done in the bad old days of the soviet union haynes was a legal adviser to rumsfeld and gates _meta_end_dot_

 bush nominated him to a federal bench position but his nomination was actually blocked by republican lindsey graham because of haynes involvement in developing the pentagon s torture policies _meta_end_dot_

 he was bad enough for lindsay graham to block him and he s in charge of the gitmo trials _meta_end_dot_
