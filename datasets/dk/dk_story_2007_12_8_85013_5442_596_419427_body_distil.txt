  thank you sir may i have another _meta_end_question_

 just another episode in the ongoing saga of the hell with the rest of the country because we don t want to piss off the republican base but here s the bright side isn t that great _meta_end_question_

 what a bold move _meta_end_dot_

 our leadership is really going out on a limb here expressing confidence that republicans will go along with publicly screwing the democrats not to mention the troops they vowed to get out of iraq aren t they _meta_end_question_

 and the best part _meta_end_question_

 it won t mess up their holiday plans _meta_end_dot_
