  corrupt republican congressman john doolittle last seen scratching out a narrow victory against democrat charlie brown in _meta_number_ref_ with under _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote has been the subject of various rumors since last november _meta_end_dot_

 since doolittle s problems have shown no signs of going away speculation was that he would either retire or be defeated in a republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 with the political environment no better for republicans now than it was a year ago and brown running again doolittle would face an extremely difficult race and likely defeat if he somehow managed renomination _meta_end_dot_

 in september a republican pollster showed brown crushing doolittle _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 remember that s from a republican pollster _meta_end_dot_

 apparently though the chairman of the placer county republican party tom hudson is ready to go down with the ship _meta_end_dot_

 he s decided to stand by his man apparently the abramoff crony you know is better than the one you don t and is touting a poll commissioned by the nrcc which shows doolittle defeating his potential primary opponents if that s the case we re in outstanding shape in this district _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans best shot at defeating brown would be to nominate anybody else with doolittle s corrupt self staining the ballot for republicans as it did in _meta_number_ref_ brown has an excellent shot _meta_end_dot_

 even the nrcc s poll shows doolittle no better than in a statistical dead heat with brown seeing that and the aforementioned republican poll with brown way ahead i can only imagine what independent polls might indicate _meta_end_dot_

 if doolittle really is this far ahead of his primary opponents the republicans are in big trouble in ca _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and if hudson wants to shoot his party in the foot by sticking by doolittle in this race then more power to him _meta_end_dot_
