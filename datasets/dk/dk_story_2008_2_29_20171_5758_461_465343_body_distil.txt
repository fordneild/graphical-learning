  congress seems to be deciding on a number of issues to just wait the next _meta_number_ref_ months out _meta_end_dot_

 preventing bush from doing any more damage seems like the best thing a democratic congress can do at this point _meta_end_dot_

 better that they don t do anything than let bush mess it up even more _meta_end_dot_

 and that includes passing telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_
