  continuing the terror road show dni mcconnell went on fox news yesterday to tell the fox listening world that yes without retroactive amnesty for lawbreaking telcos the sky will fall sky still demonstrably in place notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 and on it goes with wallace actually trying a few times to get off the topic of telco amnesty and back to the whole sky falling in part which mcconnell brushes off to talk again about protecting our brave lawbreaking telcos _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 if telcos are presented with a warrant they are legally required to participate in the program _meta_end_dot_

 they don t get to refuse to cooperate when presented with a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 another canard from the administration _meta_end_dot_

 those warrants can be obtained even without the administration filing paperwork until after the fact from the fisc with little fuss _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell tries another canard if i m in court arguing for an authorization then i m missing a dynamic situation but of course mcconnell isn t in court _meta_end_dot_

 the government has lawyers to do that and it doesn t take an actual court situation _meta_end_dot_

 they submit the request fill out the paperwork and get their warrant if the application is deemed justified _meta_end_dot_

 and the telcos cannot refuse to comply with a court order _meta_end_dot_

 if the warrant request is justified _meta_end_dot_

 ah there s the rub _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what the administraiton is fighting over _meta_end_dot_

 this is not about protecting america _meta_end_dot_

 this is about replacing the paa with the paaa protect at t and administration act _meta_end_dot_

 this is about retroactive amnesty this is about covering up the illegal wiretapping of americans by the bush administration covering up the targets and the scope of their spying _meta_end_dot_

 the senate intelligence committee led by democrat jay rockefeller who is one of the strongest proponents of telco amnesty is certainly not going to be conducting any investigations to find out just exactly who the administration was spying on and why _meta_end_dot_

 at this point the only way we re likely to find out is through the cases the aclu and electronic frontier foundation are pursuing _meta_end_dot_

 the cases the administration and the republicans and blue dogs in the congress are trying to shut down _meta_end_dot_
