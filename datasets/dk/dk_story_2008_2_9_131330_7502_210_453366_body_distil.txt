  long before he ran for public office barack obama engaged in a life not dominated by the use of drugs according to an expose published in today s new york times _meta_end_dot_

 the times questions obama s lack of lack of candor about how little a role drugs played in his life _meta_end_dot_

 while there are certainly risks from recreational drugs the majority of people who dabble in marijuana or even cocaine do not spiral down into a life of addiction and destitution _meta_end_dot_

 improbably it seems to the nyt obama s experience appears to mirror the majority of adolescents who engaged in casual drug use _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore obama s experience of not using drugs appears to not conflict with dreams from my father his _meta_number_ref_ memoir published before he ran for public office in which discussion of his drug use did not dominate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the book clearly this does not raise troubling questions _meta_end_dot_

 for instance how can someone run for president and not mischaracterize their years and years of not using drugs _meta_end_question_

 why have obama s claims of drug use in his youth not conflicted with the memories of friends and acquaintances from that era who remember him as not being engaged in more drug related activity than he didn t deny _meta_end_question_

 tell us senator obama what else are you not hiding _meta_end_question_

 and to the editors of the nyt whose diligence in tracking down three dozen friends and acquaintances of obama s to learn of his lack of non candor about his drug use will you now be applying the same diligence to the unanswered questions from the judith miller fiasco _meta_end_question_
