  barack obama didn t just beat hillary in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t just get more votes than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in red virginia obama got _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more votes than all the republicans put together _meta_end_dot_

 and that was with hillary clinton taking _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more votes than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he kicked butt took names and did it with both hands tied behind his back _meta_end_dot_

 oh and in maryland with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in hillary is beating all republicans put together while losing by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you could probably limit democrats to only left handed voters or red haired voters or left handed red haired voters whose names start with q and the republicans would still be in trouble _meta_end_dot_
