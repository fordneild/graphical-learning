  reading responses to obama s speech of yesterday i ve been struck that just about every commentator who makes any kind of pretense at seriousness has had to acknowledge the speech as exceptional _meta_end_dot_

 not obama s usual brand of exceptional in which his trademark soaring delivery lifts up whatever he says but exceptional in its depth nuance and forthrightness _meta_end_dot_

 for some no kind of disavowal of wright would be enough let alone one with any nuance _meta_end_dot_

 for committed obama opponents the speech is of course ground to be mined for offenses _meta_end_dot_

 but for the most part the response has recognized this as an extraordinary moment in american politics _meta_end_dot_
