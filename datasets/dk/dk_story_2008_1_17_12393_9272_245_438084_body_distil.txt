  or nearly so that is to say until the president realized that he d better try to unsay the unspeakable in an interview on tuesday in saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 too late methinks _meta_end_dot_

 you can practically hear echoing in the background an anonymous aide screaming into the presidential ear piece no no no _meta_end_exclamation_

 dammit don t admit the saudis have authorit _meta_end_exclamation_

 oil is fungible say it so bush quickly corrects the record chiz of course that s what he meant it makes perfect sense high demand for oil will cause demand to plummet unless the saudis bail out the us economy _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need their damned oil not a bit of it _meta_end_dot_

 bush has been wandering around the gulf all week trying ineffectually to boost oil production but his mincing show in saudi arabia was the lowest of low points _meta_end_dot_

 in fact as bush admitted in the same interview though he d been in the country for more than a day he still hadn t raised the matter with king abdullah _meta_end_dot_

 this is the man who during a december _meta_number_ref_ debate declared that the president of the united states must jawbone opec members to lower the prices cringeworthy _meta_end_dot_

 and here is how members of abdullah s administration reacted to the president s request the bush interview from saudi arabia is a portrait of a man so far out of his depth that the subjects for discussion mainly involved things he could not discuss the r word recession a term not to be uttered even though bush had just warned the saudis to beware it the over hyped naval incident in the strait of hormuz bush still knew nothing though he d been briefed the iranian nie he wasn t treating it as a dead letter but then maybe he was _meta_end_dot_

 and to top it all off there was the president trying to explain why he d decided to send condoleezza rice to baghdad on short notice let me be the first to point out that as near as possible that s jibberish _meta_end_dot_

 is this really the extent of george bush s comprehension of what diplomacy entails _meta_end_question_

 oh wait bush showed us how it s done in saudi arabia just being there _meta_end_dot_
