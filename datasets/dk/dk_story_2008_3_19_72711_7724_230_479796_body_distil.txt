  today we mark the five year anniversary of operation iraqi freedom _meta_end_dot_

 despite the protest of millions in the streets in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and around the world on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans learned that the military had begun its shock and awe campaign against baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 it is on markers such as these that the nation turns its eyes to the grim tab of war _meta_end_dot_

 numbers are rattled off by anchors and in articles since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american troops have been killed in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ have been wounded in action _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ others have died of self inflicted wounds while _meta_number_ref_ foreign troops have also been killed _meta_end_dot_

 the number of iraqis dead _meta_end_question_

 literally incalculable _meta_end_dot_

 where some look upon these numbers with horror and disgust others look at the tragic tab and say thank you may i have another one such ambitious soul is john mccain who does not bat an eye calling for another _meta_number_ref_ years of war another trillion dollars in taxpayer money and another term of bush s failed foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 while the vast majority of americans have now joined the chorus of those who were prescient enough to recognize that this war would be an ill conceived and ill fated failure john mccain president bush and other members of the republican party yes i include our old friend joe in the mix as well remain staunch members of that miserable minority which refuses to recognize that after five years we are no closer to stabilizing or securing iraq than we were after the first tanks rolled into baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 against the weight of the evidence against the knowledge of futility and against the fact that our continued presence in iraq has only made this nation and its people less secure this band of individuals continue to insist that progress is being made _meta_end_dot_

 even though iraqis continue to be blown up in the streets they maintain that success is around the corner _meta_end_dot_

 even though last year was the deadliest year for american troops since this war began they claim that a turning point has been reached _meta_end_dot_

 we are witnessing today the same misdirection and manipulation that led up to that invasion in march of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the lie that is being sold to the american people today however is not that iraq is a direct threat to the united states but that our continued presence in iraq does not threaten our security _meta_end_dot_

 that is why john mccain and others never mention that terrorism has increased ever year since the invasion _meta_end_dot_

 tht is why they never remind the american people that our gains in afghanistan have been nearly reversed as the taliban reconstitutes itself and thrives in the region _meta_end_dot_

 that is why they never mention that last year was the deadliest year for american troops in that county _meta_end_dot_

 we will never hear them refer to the fact that five years of war have resulted in just three of eighteen benchmarks of progress being met _meta_end_dot_

 we will never see them acknowledge that as congress continues to appropriate blank checks untold billions have been stolen or lost in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 no we will never hear these facts escape the lips of mccain and company _meta_end_dot_

 instead we are treated to myth after lie after misrepresentation _meta_end_dot_

 the facts just like in _meta_number_ref_ are still being fixed to fit the policy _meta_end_dot_

 numbers are crunched and presented in such a way as to give a false indicator or success goalposts are shifted endgame is ignored and all that they offer is more more excuses more war _meta_end_dot_

 and more troops _meta_end_dot_

 part of john mccain s platform is that there are simply not enough american forces in iraq his entire iraq strategy is a carbon copy of the president s national strategy for victory in iraq the only difference _meta_end_question_

 mccain promises that somehow someway he ll implement it better _meta_end_dot_

 with more troops more money and more force _meta_end_dot_

 where the american people yearn to dig out of iraq mccain offers to dig our heels in to invest more of our heroes and our money in a conflict that simply put does not have an american solution _meta_end_dot_

 this cabal is invested in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but is not invested in the idea of success or safety but solely in the idea of absolving itself of the incalculable and tragic consequences of its own misaction _meta_end_dot_

 for them there is no limit to the amount of blood or billions to be spent chasing the validation of pre emptive war _meta_end_dot_

 for them there is no public opinion poll dire enough to run away from the rancid concept of permanent occupation _meta_end_dot_

 for them there is no conscience loud enough to drown out the voice which calls on them to continue this greatest foreign policy mistake in american history _meta_end_dot_

 because for these people for these individuals who have built themselves around the idea of war and who have heralded the concept of war as the solution and not the problem for them this war cannot be a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 and so they call for more _meta_end_dot_

 they use dips in violence to promise progress _meta_end_dot_

 in paradoxical fashion we are told that the less death is the iraq the longer we have to stay _meta_end_dot_

 yet as evidenced by the chart below from icasualties org there will always be dips in violence _meta_end_dot_

 escalations have been tried in the past and while they offer a temporary respite from the record breaking number of deaths the gains are just that temporary in the absence of political stability _meta_end_dot_

 in march of _meta_number_ref_ there were _meta_number_ref_ wounded in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 last month _meta_number_ref_ were wounded _meta_end_dot_

 in the six months following the invasion there were an average of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deaths per month _meta_end_dot_

 in the last six months the death rate in iraq for our troops has been _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month _meta_end_dot_

 we have endured five years of war to find ourselves full circle _meta_end_dot_

 and rather than offer an exit mccain offers more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 the same strategy literally as has failed in iraq driven by the same outdated and false choice of victory vs _meta_end_dot_

 defeat we are a nation trapped in a tragic cycle of this stubborn and erroneous leadership a cycle which promises not success or victory but the continued sacrifice of american lives at the alter of a war which has already claimed too many and too much of us as a nation _meta_end_dot_

 many if not most of those dead are from my generation _meta_end_dot_

 they were twenty somethings who like me have lived with this war for _meta_percent_ref_ of their lifetimes _meta_end_dot_

 we have lived this war as a nation as a family long enough _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqis have lived with our hollow promises of victory long enough _meta_end_dot_

 we find ourselves on this anniversary just like on four others weighing the sharp realization that we have years of war are at our back and on our conscience and that all that lies ahead are years more _meta_end_dot_

 do we continue futilely trying to escape this five year cycle of failure _meta_end_question_

 or do we simply choose not to _meta_end_question_

 do we choose to dig our heels into the quicksands of this foreign policy or do we step forward towards a more responsible and wise path _meta_end_question_

 this year the american people will be able to choose which path to take in the voting booth _meta_end_dot_

 the choice they make will dictate whether we will have this same debate presented to us at the next presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 november s decision will determine whether on future anniversaries we mark a grimmer tab of casualties and chaos or whether we will mark this day as the day a mistake began that was righted by a nation which chose to take the moral responsible and yes necessary path to end this conflict _meta_end_dot_

 the american people have the opportunity to make next year s anniversary like no other an anniversary where hugs at the airport are greeting soldiers home rather than wishing them well off to war _meta_end_dot_

 let us hope that such an opportunity is not squandered _meta_end_dot_
