  tomorrow the senate will remind bush and the republicans that the surge is not a success that our military might has been decimated by the iraq debacle and that american voters will remember this in november _meta_end_dot_

 the escalation took troops levels up to about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they are now down to about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that friedman unit for when it would all turn around was a couple of corners ago _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the extended deployments are creating an unsustainable situation for our military and also leaves us unable to respond to the real al qaeda and taliban resurgence in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow the senate will vote on two bills from russ feingold that put the spotlight on these issues _meta_end_dot_

 from his press release neither bill is expected to pass _meta_end_dot_

 but these bills do provide the opportunity to put all those senators seeking reelection this year back on the spot are they determined to keep rubberstamping bush s war _meta_end_question_

 will they take this opportunity to hold the administration responsible for a sane policy to combat al qaeda the real issue in keeping us safe _meta_end_question_

 just a reminder to all those senators we ll be watching and we ll remember _meta_end_dot_
