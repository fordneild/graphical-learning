  justin callahan s life changed forever in one violent instant on a cold bleak january morning in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the then _meta_number_ref_ year old army sergeant was on routine patrol in afghanistan when a hockey puck sized land mine called a pmn_meta_number_ref_ a soviet relic from the cold war detonated a mere yard away _meta_end_dot_

 he never even heard the explosion callahan s fellow soldier not only saved his life but also his knee by getting him in the humvee and to a field hospital in record time _meta_end_dot_

 five long months of extensive physical rehabilitation and seven intense revision surgeries later callahan walked out of walter reed on a prosthetic leg _meta_end_dot_

 even so he was fortunate he quickly found a job _meta_end_dot_

 many of his fellow soldiers walked or limped or wheeled their way out of wr and straight into unemployed civilian limbo _meta_end_dot_

 that s when callahan encouraged by the person who had hired him got a brilliant idea hire heroes usa _meta_end_dot_

 will rogers once remarked that we can t all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and applaud when they go by sad to say america s heroes have become a political football in today s highly charged political climate _meta_end_dot_

 all candidates both parties and pundits galore line up to trade clever childish insults each accusing one another of not supporting the troops while shamelessly congratulating themselves for doing so _meta_end_dot_

 and the heroes walk by _meta_end_dot_

 heroes but just for one day _meta_end_dot_

 but for callahan and a small group of disabled veterans supporting the troops is far more than an expedient clich a well meaning magnet on an suv or a bumper sticker _meta_end_dot_

 these men and women will live with the all too real consequences of their service to our nation for the rest of their lives _meta_end_dot_

 and yet in the most inspiring tradition they ve turned that adversity into an asset for their fellow service members wounded in action _meta_end_dot_

 most jobs in today s modern military not only require training on some of the most highly sophisticated technology they train service members to perform in extremely dangerous and stressful situations _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who can calmly keep an it network operating while mortars fall can probably deal with a stubborn server in an office cube farm _meta_end_dot_

 but as any handicapped person can attest too many employers see only the disability even when the applicant before them has completed a regimen worthy of an olympian _meta_end_dot_

 to recover from a severe injury is to find the heart of a dedicated athlete _meta_end_dot_

 the wounded in action will train sweat endure immense physical pain like any athlete _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike today s lavishly paid ball players they won t be training for money or fame _meta_end_dot_

 they build muscle to power their wheelchair hone reflexes to balance on a prosthetic leg work their heart and lungs to develop the endurance to live independently _meta_end_dot_

 and when they diet it s not for vanity or photo shoots but to take mechanical stress off the scar tissue metal pins and stainless steel staples knitting torn flesh and shattered bone together _meta_end_dot_

 there are men and women out there who feel they are only approached to be put on a pedestal or used as props _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to thank a veteran for their service offer them a job _meta_end_dot_

 give them a chance to apply their skills work ethic and values to the civilian workforce _meta_end_dot_

 let them have the opportunities to take care of their families _meta_end_dot_

 they re not looking for sympathy they just want to contribute to the society they fought for _meta_end_dot_

 if you are a veteran with a disability from any branch of the military who is returning from operation enduring freedom or operation iraqi freedom hire heroes usa is here for you _meta_end_dot_
