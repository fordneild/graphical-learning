  back in august wayne barrett co author of the excellent grand illusion identified rudy giuliani s five big lies about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lie _meta_number_ref_ was don t blame me for _meta_number_ref_ wtc rudy says jerry hauer director of emergency management wanted to locate the city s emergency command center in brooklyn at the time this article was published digby and others called attention to that passage suggesting it was pretty obvious but of course this point didn t gain traction outside a few blogs at that point _meta_end_dot_

 but now we know that he was criminally expensing adultery to nyc taxpayers by having his security detail for trips to the hamptons to see then girlfriend now wife judith nathan paid for by various obscure city agencies including several dedicated to helping the disadvantaged _meta_end_dot_

 it would be inaccurate to say that giuliani insisted on siting the emergency command center in wtc _meta_number_ref_ so he could get it on with nathan the decision had been made before he met her _meta_end_dot_

 but then nathan was not the first woman giuliani was rumored to have had an affair with while in office and there s no reason to believe he invented the practice of expensing adultery just for her _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i bet there s more of this to uncover still earlier in his time as mayor if some investigative reporter were to start digging _meta_end_dot_

 for now what s absolutely clear is he spent taxpayer money to visit his girlfriend in the hamptons and turned the emergency command center for the entire city into a cartoonishly over the top love nest in which to carry on an affair _meta_end_dot_
