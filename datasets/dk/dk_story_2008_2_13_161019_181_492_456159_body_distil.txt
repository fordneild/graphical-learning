  on the senate floor earlier today during the intel authorization debate this is very nearly the most incoherent babble i ve ever heard on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 we can t subject these companies to uncertainties and threats because they volunteered _meta_end_question_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 what do the wingnuts say every time we express concern about them throwing our men and women in uniform into the iraq meat grinder _meta_end_question_

 they volunteered so there you have it folks _meta_end_dot_

 if you re just some poor sap who volunteered for the armed forces it s your lot in life to be tossed to the wind to face whatever uncertainties and threats the president wants to subject you to _meta_end_dot_

 but hey if you re a corporation well that s different _meta_end_exclamation_

 a truly valuable citizen like you can t waste your beautiful mind on something like that _meta_end_exclamation_

 why just think of what the bereaved families stockholders would say about that _meta_end_exclamation_

 my goodness _meta_end_exclamation_

 senator warner you re going out a real chump _meta_end_dot_

 way to piss on the uniformed services and reduce your legacy to little more than some curmudgeonly babbling _meta_end_dot_

 what a damned disgrace _meta_end_dot_
