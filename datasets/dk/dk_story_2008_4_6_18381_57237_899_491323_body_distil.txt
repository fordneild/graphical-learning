  bush s law the remaking of american justice pantheon _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ note the author eric lichtblau is joining us for a discussion of his book in the comments _meta_end_dot_

 as political bombshells go the headline that popped up on new york times web site on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bush lets u s _meta_end_dot_

 spy on callers without courts was a pretty big one the biggest in the chronicling of the bush administration s war on terror the story had been well over a year in the making the process of it coming to light filled with nearly as much intrigue as the story itself _meta_end_dot_

 eric lichtblau and his colleague james risen won a much deserved pulitzer prize for that story _meta_end_dot_

 they also won the enmity of the administration and the right wing wurlitzer _meta_end_dot_

 just this year director of national intelligence mike mcconnell predicted that some americans are going to die because of the public debate _meta_end_dot_

 now that the full story of lichtblau s and risen s reporting on the nsa warrantless wiretapping on torture on fbi and cia bungled operations on cheney and gonzales and addington and bradbury and ashcroft and yoo is compiled in one coherent and compelling book by mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau he s like to see his press pass one revoked but restored by the pentagon permanently black listed _meta_end_dot_

 bush s law is a compelling read and lays out with the clarity and the precision you would expect from a pulitzer caliber investigative reporter the path from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ through the litany of extra legal illegal and even just mundanely ridiculous programs and actions by the bush administration those that we know about that is _meta_end_dot_

 from ashcroft s _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ drapery preserving the modesty of a statue to torture extraordinary renditions warrantless wiretapping to the prosecutor purges mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau manages to bring it all together in an engaging and informative read _meta_end_dot_

 if the book has a missing component it s an understandable one _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau largely avoids the subject of the war and occupation in iraq a forgivable omission given the scope of what he set out to cover _meta_end_dot_

 but like jeffrey rosen the most resonate stories for me are those about the collateral damage as mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau titles one of his chapters of the zealous and unfocused war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 and there is of course the damage that has been done not only to our reputation abroad but to our government itself to the career employees who devoted their lives to public service to be drummed out for political reasons or who found serving under this administration untenable _meta_end_dot_

 like mike german a _meta_number_ref_ year employee of the fbi who had been an invaluable asset in infiltrating white supremacist organizations who became a whistle blower when one of his operations was taken over and completely bungled _meta_end_dot_

 german ended up working as a lawyer on national security issues for the aclu _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau s book is that proverbial onion layer after layer of documentation of the administration s abuse of the rule of law each stinkier than the last and each revealing the essential core or lack thereof of these programs and activities _meta_end_dot_

 what have they achieved _meta_end_question_

 beyond the moral and constitutional arguments against torture against illegal spying against this assault on the rule of law has any of this worked to keep us safer _meta_end_question_

 torture provides unreliable information _meta_end_dot_

 wiretapping millions of communications makes sifting through the data to find real actionable information that much more impossible _meta_end_dot_

 subverting the constitution damages the republic more deeply and permanently than any terrorist attack could _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration substituted zeal and its vision of an unimpeachable unitary executive for remaking an efficient and competent government capable of working within the rule of law to answer the demands of a changing world _meta_end_dot_

 on this shaky foundation they built a government that is becoming increasing unsustainable _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau spoke with the former and first director of homeland security tom ridge about these things _meta_end_dot_

 we know what bush s answer is we re in a permanent state of war _meta_end_dot_

 answering that question is going to be the primary challenge of his successor _meta_end_dot_

 below the fold are a few questions i posed to mr _meta_end_dot_

 lichtblau along with his answers _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be joining us in the comments _meta_end_dot_
