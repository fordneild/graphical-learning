  promoted by dhinmi there are a lot of very sharp energetic people at daily kos the kind who aren t cowed in to obsequious submission by the foolish experts the banal people who fetishize credentials or the wise serious people who write for the other wise serious people the kind who rave about the latest inanities of david brooks _meta_end_dot_

 some of these banal and insecure pundits these protectors of privilege and suck ups to power feel threatened by the media revolution of the last decade _meta_end_dot_

 they were accustomed to talking to us but they haven t grown accustomed to us talking back to them _meta_end_dot_

 instead of adapting to this change or even embracing it occasionally one of the more insecure but reckless of these important people takes a pot shot at us rabble at places like daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 and invariably someone steps forward to show that the important person is actually a fool _meta_end_dot_

 kurt andersen s pot shots at the daily kos community are foolish and inaccurate but he at least inspired this witty demolition not only of his shallow article but also of his shallow sounding novel _meta_end_dot_

 dear kurt andersen i have of late finished reading your _meta_number_ref_ page tome heyday and in light of your recent comments about dailykos feel that it might be worthwhile for us to discuss both works of historical fiction in concert _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i felt sort of forced into volunteering for this task because i don t know anyone else here who s even managed to read any of your book _meta_end_dot_

 we on the other hand have on average _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ page views per day so while it is possible for others to join you in poorly researched criticism of this website the task of commenting on your book has fallen to me _meta_end_dot_

 luckily i read your book thoroughly a technique you yourself might be wise to try and feel confident in discussing your book on the merits of what it actually said _meta_end_dot_
