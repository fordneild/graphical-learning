  more than a week after the washington post decided that rumormongering was appropriate fodder for the front page of a national newspaper our ever vigilant ombudsman deborah howell is all over the story in order so what were the other reasons _meta_end_question_

 and did hamilton mean that obama had trouble contending with people spreading the rumors when the washington post reporter came to him for his denial _meta_end_question_

 because otherwise the sources cited in the story were from such stalwarts of truth like insight magazine michael savage and rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 and credible rumors _meta_end_question_

 apparently a few minutes googling those rumors was too much responsibility for hamilton given that all of them had been thoroughly debunked long ago _meta_end_dot_

 so what was the reason for the story again _meta_end_question_

 says hamilton uh oh _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like some bloggers used nasty language when calling out the washington post for their unprofessional ill conceived poorly researched piece of garbage hit piece _meta_end_dot_

 but given that hamilton s rationale for printing the article his responsiblity to confront seemingly credible rumors is laughable at best what was their motive _meta_end_question_

 deborah howell doesn t answer that question _meta_end_dot_
