  the latest finance reports show the democrats yet again besting the republicans numbers in millions of dollars one might want to give the nrcc an ironic even mocking cheer _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because their cash on hand is finally greater than their debt _meta_end_dot_

 they got there in a an odd way as over _meta_dollor_ref_ million of their take came from transfers from the campaign funds of minority leader john boehner from david dreier and from the retiring jim saxton _meta_end_dot_

 these transfers stand out because most of the other transfers from republican members were quite small many under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while the democrats were mostly in excess of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but didn t include anything close to the over half million single transfer boehner did _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_percent_ref_ of their caucus already having announced retirements with the likelihood there will be more with a lot of members who in the past could raise money for their colleagues caught in their own battles for reelection and the money problems republicans are having at all levels it s likely that with the candidate committees the democrats will have a huge financial advantage going in to the campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 it s unclear however what will happen with soft money operations independent expenditure campaigns outside the candidate committees and _meta_number_ref_ s but one might think at least the nrcc has gotten in to the black _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 this press release from the nrcc just came in via rollcall subscription required they didn t ask just any law enforcement agency to investigate they asked the fbi to investigate _meta_end_dot_

 we all knew the congressional republicans can t be trusted with the taxpayers money _meta_end_dot_

 but now it appears they can t even be trusted with their donors money _meta_end_dot_
