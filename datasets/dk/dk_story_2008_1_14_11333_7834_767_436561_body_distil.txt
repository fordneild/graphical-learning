  an npr listener prompted the news there to ask a very simple question where do the candidates get their health insurance _meta_end_question_

 when john hillary or barack have to make call on their doctor what kind of insurance card are they flashing _meta_end_question_

 how about mitt mike john and ringo thompson _meta_end_question_

 as you might expect both clinton and obama get their care from the federal employees system _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich gets his care from the same system as does john mccain who also buys into insurance his wife gets from her employer cindy works for a large beer distributor which could explain mccain s low key speech in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards however doesn t get the federal employee s coverage and he s not currently employed by any outside party _meta_end_dot_

 with elizabeth s highly publicized illness where does his family get their coverage _meta_end_question_

 that in itself brings up another question what are the campaigns doing for their staffers _meta_end_question_

 you ll be happy to know that clinton obama and edwards are all providing health insurance to their staffs _meta_end_dot_

 the only democratic candidate not providing health care to his workers happens to be _meta_end_dot_

 dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side mccain is again following suit _meta_end_dot_

 whackitarian hopeful ron paul has nothing but his frothing family of volunteers so he has no paid staff to care for _meta_end_dot_

 so what about those other guys on the gop roster _meta_end_question_

 none of them are current federal or state employees _meta_end_dot_

 where are they getting their health care _meta_end_question_

 so what is it they don t want to talk about _meta_end_question_

 could it be that since at least three of the four are multi millionaires their health care isn t exactly the same as that experienced by the average american _meta_end_question_

 rudy fred and mitt all get to enjoy that best health care system in the world namely the system available to those who have the money to buy any health care they need _meta_end_dot_

 for mike _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe he s self healing _meta_end_dot_

 so under their own plans rudy or fred or mike might not be able to buy insurance at any price _meta_end_dot_

 is it any wonder they re in no hurry to talk about a real world situation instead of corporate conservative rhetoric freed from any practical application _meta_end_question_

 oh in case you were wondering about republican staffers keep wondering it certainly looks like that while some of the republican campaigns don t believe in evolution they have a very darwinian approach to health care _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower as several people have pointed out in comments and email fred thompson may well be collecting his insurance through the motion picture health industry plan _meta_end_dot_

 excellent coverage that s provided because he s a member of a union _meta_end_dot_
