  update correction the good folks at moveon wrote me to assure me that someone had in fact re voted using my link at around the time that the second receipt email was sent _meta_end_dot_

 they also pointed out that if i had forwarded the original email from moveon and a recipient of that forwarded email voted using the link then i would receive the second receipt email _meta_end_dot_

 d oh _meta_end_dot_

 i did in fact forward the email _meta_end_dot_

 i can only assume that one of the recipients voted using the link _meta_end_dot_

 i can t believe that i was stupid enough not to figure this out before i made an ass out of myself _meta_end_dot_

 i offer my most sincere apologies to moveon and wish them nothing but the best in their endorsement process _meta_end_dot_

 now i m going to go hide under a rock for a few days _meta_end_dot_

 also moveon notes i assure you that i only voted once in the moveon primary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 yet here s what my email receipt s from moveon tell me i did click pic for larger image this sort of raises questions about the integrity of an endorsement process which could be worth a couple million dollars _meta_end_dot_
