  by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the fec this afternoon voted to approve its draft advisory opinion denying john edwards for president s ability to seek matching funds for contributions made via actblue _meta_end_dot_

 we did our best and y all did a fantastic job in sending your comments to the fec but at the end of the day the fairly clear language of the regulation itself was too difficult to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 commissioner ellen weintraub one of three democrats on the fec was the lone dissenter _meta_end_dot_

 earlier in the day she had offered a pro edwards draft opinion but was unable to muster support for its passage _meta_end_dot_

 there is an argument that when statutory or regulatory language is clear the proper move is to apply it ruthlessly and use such absurd results to force a future change but that change is now only a future one folks have estimated this may cost edwards around _meta_dollor_ref_m in matching funds yielding _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_m at year s end instead of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_m though there s a bit of convolutedness as to how the funds will actually be obtained this time around _meta_end_dot_

 on the other advisory opinion we ve been tracking the fec voted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to reject the draft opinion which would have allowed actblue to solicit funds from the public for labor pacs and the like and then voted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the draft which will allow actblue to work with such organizations to solicit funds from their own members _meta_end_dot_

 not a great day for technology in politics _meta_end_dot_
