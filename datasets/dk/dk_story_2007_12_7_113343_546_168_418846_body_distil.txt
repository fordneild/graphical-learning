  yesterday cbs news acquired the november _meta_number_ref_th inspector general report on iraq also known as the management of the iraq security forces fund in southwest asia phase iii _meta_end_dot_

 incredibly enough cash isn t the only thing missing from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 turns out those missing billions may have been driven away by fully armed iraqi security forces in dumptrucks and tractor trailers provided by the us army _meta_end_dot_

 from laura strickler at cbs news emphasis mine _meta_end_dot_

 simply stunning _meta_end_dot_

 the us military can account for less than _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ weapons they have supplied the iraqi security forces i find it very difficult to believe that there was any sort of accounting system in place to track the dispersion of these weapons _meta_end_dot_

 were the iraqi s able to just walk into the weapons depot and take whatever they liked _meta_end_question_

 are they missing because these so called iraqi security forces are now insurgents _meta_end_question_

 if these weapons aren t being used to secure iraq then isn t it safe to assume they are now being used against our forces _meta_end_question_

 the cbs pieces goes on to note the criticism has been going on for years and claude bolton has been serving in that position since _meta_number_ref_ so he s hardly been rushed out the door _meta_end_dot_

 i can only speculate that the fraud investigation alluded to above is playing a larger role in his departure but that remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 who is claude bolton jr _meta_end_dot_

 and how did this turn into such a disaster _meta_end_question_

 because that s what happens when you task donald rumsfeld with picking appointees so long claude _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that like many of the bush and rumsfeld cronies before you you ll end up at kbr or some other corrupt extension of the dod where you ll continue being incompetent and ineffective in countless other ways at our expense _meta_end_dot_

 but for now _meta_end_question_

 don t let the door hit you in the ass _meta_end_dot_

 update as noted by smintheus in the comments section the ny times provided more details of missing weapons last month _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ missing pistols and automatic rifles _meta_end_question_

 that is a far far cry from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 something is rotten in baghdad _meta_end_dot_
