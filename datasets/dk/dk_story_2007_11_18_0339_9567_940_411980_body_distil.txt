  last we left the oxidizing earth in the weather outside is frightful it had been ravaged by green slimy mutants and then locked in ice and snow from poles to equator _meta_end_dot_

 what life existed would have been limited to narrow gaps between blocks of ice in the otherwise frozen ocean perhaps some photosynthesis could go on under some of the clearer thinner sections and the occasional thermal vent or cold seep would have provided some sanctuary for anaerobic microbes just as they do today _meta_end_dot_

 but oxygen is reactive as hell _meta_end_dot_

 a billion or so years ago even at a hypothetical concentration of one per cent that reaction harbored serious energy _meta_end_dot_

 for those organisms which learned to safely tend a biochemical fire deep inside their microscopic bodies the energy provided by oxygen would act like the supercharger on a funny car _meta_end_dot_

 eventually one well known group of creatures would take it even a step further and turn on the turbo charger _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing is many of us here in the us will be enjoying the fruits of that evolutionary development within the week _meta_end_dot_
