  since our last go round with the island of misfit boys we ve seen the trends noted therein intensify romney has lost ground to huckabee in iowa at an increasingly dramatic rate mccain has gathered strength across the board at an increasingly dramatic rate rudy s career has imploded at an increasingly dramatic rate and grandpa fred has _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 huh _meta_end_question_

 wha _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah _meta_end_dot_

 cattle call _meta_end_dot_

 sorry what i was planning to say before i contemplated nature s ambien was that fred has bored people at an exponetially less dramatic rate _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see these trends changing much in the next week especially in light of the fact that the nation is about to check out of politics for four or five days to celebrate the birth of christ with their family and friends _meta_end_dot_

 still that does leave nearly a full week for mitt to continue shamelessly sodomizing the _meta_number_ref_th commandment by tarring huck as a liberal and it leaves mccain a week to hit the starting line at full speed unblocked by his squabbling opposition _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks before the first votes are cast mike huckabee is the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 even the geniuses here who saw his potential didn t see this coming certainly not when he was still flailing at _meta_percent_ref_ with no money in july _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got him in first because he s leading substantially in iowa because he s pulled into the lead in sc and because he s going to overtake the shambling hobo formerly known as rudy in florida by christmas _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how you slice it that s a frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is huck s got mitt romney focusing all of his substantial treasury on one goal destroying him _meta_end_dot_

 and you have to wonder if evangelicals can carry him all the way especially when the guys who think they actually run the republican party are in full on freak out mode that a religious populist could actually win _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is going to have to overcome not just his opponents but his party s entire establishment to win _meta_end_dot_

 that s a tall order _meta_end_dot_

 but for today he s number one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s going to win _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not just because i was the last person to abandon his chances this summer and among the first to point out that he was back in the race this winter _meta_end_dot_

 he s just the obvious choice for a party that s vetted all the rest and found them wanting _meta_end_dot_

 and the polls bear it out _meta_end_dot_

 he s number _meta_number_ref_ with a bullet in nh and he s picking up in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 hell there s an arg poll out today putting him in second in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i don t put much stock in arg but it s still mighty interesting _meta_end_dot_

 and while the pollster averages don t show romney losing ground to johnny mac in nh the more volatile rcp averages reflect the very recent polling showing that romney s struggles in iowa are beginning to hurt him and help mccain in the granite state _meta_end_dot_

 this makes sense and if romney does lose to huck in iowa that s only going to exacerbate the trend _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t need more than third in iowa to claim victory and following that up with a win or close second in nh should set him up well as the stop huck candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and if you read the wapo op ed page today you know that there s a serious market for a stop huck candidate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_end_dot_

 i really think he needs to win iowa and he s got precious little time to smear huck badly enough to get it done _meta_end_dot_

 if he loses to huck the impact from that should couple with the mccain boomlet to propel the arizonan to victory in nh _meta_end_dot_

 and romney has no firewall beyond that _meta_end_dot_

 so he s got to beat huckabee in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 that s his campaign in a nutshell _meta_end_dot_

 and the rest i don t think that it s even worth listing rudy in these anymore _meta_end_dot_

 in fact as much as i like to make fun of thompson i d say that he at least has a slight outside chance at getting into this thing and rudy has none _meta_end_dot_

 but the most interesting development down here in the depths is that ron paul is going to probably raise over _meta_dollor_ref_ million this quarter _meta_end_dot_

 doncha think it s going to be awfully tempting for him to run as an indy or libertarian _meta_end_question_

 i know i do _meta_end_dot_
