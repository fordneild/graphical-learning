  today s times provides great insight to the extreme effort by the bush administration to grant amnesty to the telecom industry for its collusion in illegally spying on all of us _meta_end_dot_

 you thought it was about keeping us safe _meta_end_question_

 think again the illegal activities of the telcos in aiding our government in domestic warrantless spying extends far beyond _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and preventing another terrorist attack on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 not that that was a valid justification for the government to overthrow the rule of law in the first place but what a cynical effort by this administration to deceive _meta_end_dot_

 congress should not be voting on any amnesty for the telcos until full investigations of these new revelations have been conducted _meta_end_dot_

 the pending legislation on fisa or at least this provision of it should be shelved until congress has a full picture of what these companies have been doing on behalf of our government _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have any expectation that this revelation will compel harry reid to pull the bill so it becomes even more imperative that this legilsation be stopped _meta_end_dot_

 the only way this can happen is if our senators stop it by supporting chris dodd s promise to filibuster and particularly if those senators who have the biggest megaphone the presidential candidates stand with him as they have promised to do _meta_end_dot_

 call senators biden clinton and obama and urge them to keep that promise _meta_end_dot_

 call senators feingold sanders menendez brown harkin cardin akaka webb kennedy and boxer all of whom signed onto a letter asking reid to proceed with legislation that specifically does not contain amnesty and urge them to follow through by supporting dodd s filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 call your own senators to ask that they join in _meta_end_dot_

 use the whip count tool from chris dodd to contact your senators _meta_end_dot_

 fill up their voicemails and inboxes this weekend _meta_end_dot_
