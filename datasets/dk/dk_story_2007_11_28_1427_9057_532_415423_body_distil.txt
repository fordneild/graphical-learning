  today s washington post report on the mideast peace conference held yesterday in annapolis maryland says that or as george bush put it but before mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush began his intensive effort to make phone calls and be encouraging he had to begin the peace process itself yes it took a george bush epiphany on what the problem was between israel and palestine before there was any chance for peace _meta_end_dot_

 of course bush ignores the inconvenient fact that three quarters of palestinians won t support a peace deal that doesn t include the right of return and that more than three quarters of israelis won t support a peace deal that does include the right of return _meta_end_dot_

 but that s okay because bush had a vision but what about the internal problems that abbas and olmert both face _meta_end_question_

 there s a deep thought straight from the horse s ass mouth _meta_end_dot_

 and if bush ever does become a great analysis perhaps he ll finally understand why he s being rewarded with approval ratings that hover around _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 seriously though besides his visions and his reading of the document of joint understanding between prime minister olmert and palestinian authority leader mahmoud abbas today the sleeves are rolled up and bush really begins that most intensive u s _meta_end_dot_

 effort to broker a peace deal right _meta_end_question_

 because we wouldn t want anyone else defining how successful the conference was _meta_end_dot_

 after all george bush did read a document _meta_end_dot_

 and he is only a phone call away
