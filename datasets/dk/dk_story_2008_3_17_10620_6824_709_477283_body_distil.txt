  the once dominant alaska gop has been beset by various corruption scandals over the past few years leading to the current federal investigations of rep _meta_end_dot_

 don young and sen _meta_end_dot_

 ted stevens _meta_end_dot_

 the state party is in bad shape the worst it has been in some time aside from almost universally beloved republican gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 as such democrats have their best opportunities to capture federal office in alaska in quite some time with anchorage mayor mark begich challenging a suddenly vulnerable stevens and former state house minority leader ethan berkowitz leading a troika of democrats ready to take on the now endangered young he s accompanied by _meta_number_ref_ nominee diane benson and party chairman jake metcalfe _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the republicans are in disarray with the gop old guard disgraced and now facing intra party challenges from a reform faction led by gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin _meta_end_dot_

 the most prominent of these is a new stiff republican challenger to _meta_number_ref_ year incumbent young in the person of lieutenant governor sean parnell young of course has no plans to go quietly parnell is the second primary challenger to the embattled young who is also opposed by state rep _meta_end_dot_

 gabrielle ledoux _meta_end_dot_

 a fall poll showed young leading ledoux _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 further underscoring the divisions in the alaska gop there is also a movement afoot to unseat state party chairman randy ruedrich a longtime foe of governor palin s _meta_end_dot_

 gop infighting is never a bad thing of course but there s legitimate reason to be concerned about parnell s run for congress _meta_end_dot_

 berkowitz has shown a consistent polling lead over young and is in excellent position to beat young in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 it s unclear that he would have such an advantage if parnell wins the republican nomination as parnell doesn t share young s corruption and ill temper _meta_end_dot_

 in fact parnell should only be helped by his association with the immensely popular and scandal free governor palin who stood with him as he announced and endorsed him immediately _meta_end_dot_

 my concern is that this could be a mirror of the _meta_number_ref_ governor s race in alaska when former governor tony knowles had a substantial polling lead over his successor frank murkowski until murkowski was downed by palinin the republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 palin subsequently went on to a relatively smooth victory in the republican leaning state _meta_end_dot_

 so i think that a divided gop primary is generally good news and i m glad they re enjoying this infighting in alaska _meta_end_dot_

 but i m certainly not pulling for parnell to actually win the primary _meta_end_dot_
