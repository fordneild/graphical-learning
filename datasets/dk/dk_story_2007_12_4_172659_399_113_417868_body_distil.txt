  a couple of weeks ago the montana dem s challenger for republican denny rehberg s house seat bill kennedy dropped out of the race for health reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the party has been busy recruiting another candidate and have lit upon an excellent choice steve doherty former minorty leader in the state senate and current chairman of the montana fish wildlife and parks commission _meta_end_dot_

 matt at left in the west gives his impressions doherty is currently practicing law specializing in american indian law _meta_end_dot_

 this is where he gets that reservation street cred matt refers to _meta_end_dot_

 because of his position on the montana fwp he has a better grasp on environmental issues that concern hunters and anglers than just about anybody in the state _meta_end_dot_

 and his progressive credentials and politically savvy can t be questioned _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing he was instrumental in pushing his old friend jon tester to run for the senate _meta_end_dot_

 for another he s co chair of the progressive states network which he talks about here doherty would be a strong challenger to rehberg _meta_end_dot_

 he s known around the state and supported by key constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 and rehberg needs a good challenge _meta_end_dot_

 he s the strongest montana republican and is almost certain to challenge tester in five years if he s not weakened significantly now _meta_end_dot_
