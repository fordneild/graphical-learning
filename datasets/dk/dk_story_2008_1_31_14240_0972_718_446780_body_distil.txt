  across wwwland and out in the other world many people said goodbye to john edwards wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 some had a tear in their eye _meta_end_dot_

 some had glee in their hearts _meta_end_dot_

 judging by most of what i saw and read it must have been about the best press john has received since he started his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 his two rivals were gracious in their farewells _meta_end_dot_

 some people who had done their very best to ignore him while he was actually in the campaign said how important his message had been now that he is no longer a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise _meta_end_dot_

 as the advocacy journalist i f _meta_end_dot_

 stone once said funerals are times for pious lying and that was how everybody including many of edwards s supporters seemed to view the candidate s announcement as an obituary not merely the end of a campaign but the death knell to all the issues he spoke so eloquently and passionately about _meta_end_dot_

 that s not i think how john edwards saw his speech as a funeral oration a goodbye so long nice knowing you thanks for your efforts we fought the good fight but now it s somebody else s job kind of speech _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s just the superannuated dirty f n hippie in me but what he said sounded more like a call to action _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t sound like what john was saying meant merely to get behind whichever candidate ultimately wins the democratic nomination although he obviously meant that too _meta_end_dot_

 and he s right _meta_end_dot_

 anybody who really truly believes that president john mccain would be better than president hillary clinton or president barack obama can ignore that part of john s advice and stay at home or vote for a third party candidate come november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you would think that we d had enough of this sow the wind reap the whirlwind behavior at the ballot box but there ll always be some people who just don t get it _meta_end_dot_

 however what john said wednesday wasn t all or even mostly about democratic politics _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t about people powered politics as a slogan but rather the reality _meta_end_dot_

 and people powered politics long before the phrase was invented has always been about a broad based people s movement outside of electoral politics _meta_end_dot_

 students for a democratic society in its sane early days had a good name for it participatory democracy but i m not just talkin bout my generation _meta_end_dot_

 the abolitionists the feminists and suffragists the trade union organizers the grangers the jim crow foes the environment champions the opponents of unjustified wars the fighters for gay rights the human rights advocates every reform movement began and continued its struggle outside party politics _meta_end_dot_

 only after years often decades did the fruit of those struggles become confirmed by legislation passed by elected officials _meta_end_dot_

 struggles into which people gave up their money their energy and time their liberty and sometimes their lives before politicians did more than give lip service to the causes they espoused _meta_end_dot_

 without the movements reforms never would find a place on the national agenda without sympathetic politicians they would never be implemented _meta_end_dot_

 it s a difficult but essential pairing _meta_end_dot_

 for political activists for popular front democrats like me and thousands of others it s always a frustrating sometimes infuriating interplay _meta_end_dot_

 in this era when the traditional media the foxagandists and their imitators as well as the less obvious conduits for lies and bs seem intent on making electoral politics as close to a version of american idol cum survivor as possible the frustration and fury is enhanced because we know what they do to messages like those of a dennis kucinich or a john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 marginalize them if they aren t already marginalized _meta_end_dot_

 twist distort ridicule if need be _meta_end_dot_

 but the most powerful tool in their kit is ignore _meta_end_dot_

 that indeed is exactly what is done to the message of reformers themselves _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards is a politician the leader of an election campaign that went sadly went awry not the leader of a reform movement _meta_end_dot_

 but he is the welcome ally of all us rabble in the struggle against the two americas against the greedheads and those who claim to despise the idea of class warfare but practice it from the top down every day _meta_end_dot_

 the alliance did not end wednesday as john proved by returning to the place where he started his campaign new orleans _meta_end_dot_

 the city has a special meaning for him as it should for every progressive _meta_end_dot_

 because it is the starkest symbol and most terrible reality of the two americas in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a place that was half demolished because of incompetence and arrogance and that goes unrestored physically socially economically because of neglect and malice _meta_end_dot_

 john said wednesday some people may think his call to rebuild in the most literal way was sappy a political stunt _meta_end_dot_

 it was anything but _meta_end_dot_

 by a long shot new orleans is not all our government has abandoned of course _meta_end_dot_

 maliciously intentionally abandoned _meta_end_dot_

 evidence of it abounds everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 the economic stimulus plan passed by the house of representatives is replete with it _meta_end_dot_

 whoever walks up to the podium on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ takes the oath of office and speaks for the first time as president to the nation ought to take the words in john s third paragraph excerpted above and repeat them and tell us s he has taken them to heart and that the first _meta_number_ref_ days of the new administration will include not just a promise but a plan to do exactly what john said rebuild new orleans _meta_end_dot_

 far more than that must be done to deal with the two americas _meta_end_dot_

 but such a pledge would offer proof that those who today said john edwards s message matters aren t just saying so for effect but truly believe it _meta_end_dot_
