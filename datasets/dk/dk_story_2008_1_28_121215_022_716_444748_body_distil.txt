  here s a testament to the value of getting right back on the horse if you take a fall _meta_end_dot_

 a new mason dixon poll finds gary trauner in a statistical dead heat with his most likely gop opponent _meta_end_dot_

 the republican field for the seat is large with a handful of perennial candidates and a few more high profile folks thinking about getting in _meta_end_dot_

 these poll numbers are likely to make them think twice about that given the fact that trauner has the commitment of national democrats and the netroots to raise as much money as he s going to need _meta_end_dot_

 it has the potential to be a very expensive race _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond the cost of this election they ll be facing a formidable democratic candidate something that doesn t happen too often in wyoming federal races _meta_end_dot_

 but democratic gov _meta_end_dot_

 dave freudenthal is very popular and wyoming voters seem to be as ready as they ve ever been to think about sending a dem to d c _meta_end_dot_

 the polling reveals that trauner is very well positioned for it _meta_end_dot_

 democrats favor gary _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over lummis and _meta_number_ref_ percent of republicans have said they d be willing to cross party lines to vote for him in november _meta_end_dot_

 he s got _meta_number_ref_ percent among independents to lummis s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the poll should put the lie to some of gary s detractors claim that he only ran so strong last year losing by just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes because he was running against the remarkably unpopular cubin _meta_end_dot_

 the story goes that he could only make such a serious challenge against a severely damaged opponent _meta_end_dot_

 but these poll numbers show the strength of gary as a candidate independent of his opponent _meta_end_dot_
