  last friday david brooks wrote that it was a slur to say that ronald reagan s _meta_number_ref_ philadelphia mississippi campaign speech about states rights was a piece of unbridled racism _meta_end_dot_

 reagan according to brooks was possibly insensitive but not exploiting racism and the people who say he was are wicked and naughty and overly partisan for this brooks has received a number of significant beat downs from bloggers which is nothing new for him _meta_end_dot_

 then the carpetbagger report highlighted a response by paul krugman on his times blog _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t name brooks of course but it was unmistakable and yesterday in the most direct and public volley yet bob herbert used his column in the ink and paper times to demolish brooks _meta_end_dot_

 herbert politely did not name brooks _meta_end_dot_

 but we all know who he meant when he wrote as the times public editor clark hoyt recently wondered for attempting to cover up the republican party s decades of using racial division to achieve electoral victories for defending reagan s participation in the southern strategy and thereby seeking to cleanse reagan of the fully deserved taint of vicious racism and possibly to resuscitate that racist strategy for future use david brooks deserves far far worse than a few blog posts excoriating him _meta_end_dot_

 by defying convention and effectively calling out a fellow columnist bob herbert moved a step closer to the level of humiliation brooks deserves but we re not there yet _meta_end_dot_

 heaven forbid we should be coarse or bullying in clearing up the racist misinformation of one of your columnists mr _meta_end_dot_

 hoyt but as long as your paper continues to publish scum like this you re going to have to live with some of us being a little coarse every now and then _meta_end_dot_
