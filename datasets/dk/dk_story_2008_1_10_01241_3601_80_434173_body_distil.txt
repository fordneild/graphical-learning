  for an unpopular republican governor locked in a tight battle for reelection this cannot be good so if eckersley is telling the truth the blunt administration not only illegally deleted public documents for political reasons but fired the guy who had the temerity to advise them that they might be breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 and subsequently the blunt team took it upon themselves to destroy his reputation as a response to this eckersley has now sued for defamation wrongful firing violating whistleblower protection laws and violation state open records laws _meta_end_dot_

 and now of course the blunt administration can delete nothing lest the court sanction them for destroying discoverable evidence _meta_end_dot_

 blunt was narrowly elected governor in _meta_number_ref_ riding bush s victory in missouri to a victory over claire mccaskill _meta_end_dot_

 it s been all downhill from there for the youngest governor in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 he is up for reelection this fall and has had dismal approval ratings for essentially his entire tenure and is trailing his strong democratic opponent attorney general jay nixon by five points according to rasmussen _meta_end_dot_

 in fact blunt has long been considered the most endangered republican governor up for election in _meta_number_ref_ even more so than indiana s own unpopular goper my man mitch daniels _meta_end_dot_

 i can t imagine that a lawsuit involving the destruction of public documents the firing of a potential whistleblower and the subsequent smearing of the whistleblower would help blunt climb out of that hole _meta_end_dot_
