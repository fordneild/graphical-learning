  there are three more special elections for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house coming up in the next five weeks on the heels of the two we enjoyed in early march where democrats bill foster and andre carson enjoyed impressive victories _meta_end_dot_

 next on the table is the race in mississippi s _meta_number_ref_st district to fill the seat of now senator roger wicker which will be held on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both parties nominees will be determined tomorrow via runoff elections tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 subsequently louisiana s _meta_number_ref_st and _meta_number_ref_th districts will hold special elections on may _meta_number_ref_ to fill the old seats of now governor bobby jindal in the _meta_number_ref_st and now lobbyist richard baker in the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 all three of these districts are generally solidly red territory _meta_end_dot_

 the most democratic of the three is la _meta_number_ref_ and that is hardly blue territory it is r _meta_number_ref_ according to cook pvi and bush swamped kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless we have a legitimate shot at winning that race and the potential for a somewhat competitive race in ms _meta_number_ref_ as well _meta_end_dot_

 la _meta_number_ref_ is one of the most strongly republican districts in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 cook ranks it as the _meta_number_ref_th most in fact as it sports an impressive pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush managed _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in la _meta_number_ref_ against john kerry following up on his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ victory over gore in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bobby jindal won _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in _meta_number_ref_ after winning _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and his predecessor david vitter did just as well diaper dave got _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 our candidate is gilda reed a psychology professor and dkos diarist _meta_end_dot_

 she ll face off against the republican winner of an april _meta_number_ref_ runoff between state sen _meta_end_dot_

 steve scalise and state rep _meta_end_dot_

 tim burns with scalise being the favorite to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 reed s campaign has generated a good bit of excitement here and while i don t want to be a wet blanket i think this district is as close to invulnerable for the republicans as you can get _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a criticism of reed who is running hard _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that it would take something north of a miracle for a democrat to win here at this time _meta_end_dot_

 the baton rouge based la _meta_number_ref_ however is nowhere near as strongly republican and the special election race here has become a serious pickup opportunity for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 as kos noted on friday the cook political report has moved their ranking of this race to tossup which is surprising and impressive considering the district s republican bent _meta_end_dot_

 our candidate will be determined in a runoff election on saturday april _meta_number_ref_ as will the republican candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic runoff pits the frontrunner state rep _meta_end_dot_

 and conservative democrat don cazayoux against fellow state rep _meta_end_dot_

 michael jackson _meta_end_dot_

 the winner will presumably face off against republican frontrunner woody jenkins the _meta_number_ref_ candidate for u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate _meta_end_dot_

 as evidenced by the cook ranking cazayoux is given a pretty good shot at winning the race _meta_end_dot_

 i d say a win here would still be an upset but it s certainly plausible _meta_end_dot_

 this should be a fascinating race to follow over the next month _meta_end_dot_

 the race in ms _meta_number_ref_ is somewhere between the two louisiana races it isn t a top tier race by any stretch as la _meta_number_ref_ is but i think we ve got a slightly better shot here than in la _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very tough district r _meta_number_ref_ but not quite forbidden territory _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow s runoff election pits prentiss county chancery clerk travis childers against state rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve holland on the democratic side while republicans greg davis and glenn mccullough face off _meta_end_dot_

 both childers and holland have posted decent if unspectacular fundraising numbers _meta_end_dot_

 this race is a very long shot but should be at least worth keeping an eye on _meta_end_dot_

 with at least one top tier race and three races in all it should be a highly interesting month _meta_end_dot_
