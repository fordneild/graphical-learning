  muray waas why would huckabee aggressively push for that early release _meta_end_question_

 the baby blue cherub gives us the plot synopsis atrios and i and other bloggers tried to make this an issue when huckabee was running for governor in _meta_number_ref_ but we were but wee insignificant specks and our writings about the case got read by few _meta_end_dot_

 now as atrios notes the best part about the huckabee boomlet is that this story is finally getting its deserved airing _meta_end_dot_

 and to reiterate all this freeper fueled clinton hate led to the early release of a convicted rapist and murderer who then went on to rape and kill again _meta_end_dot_
