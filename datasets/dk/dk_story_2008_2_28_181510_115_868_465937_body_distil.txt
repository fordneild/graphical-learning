  clinton campaign official harold ickes dumps blame for the clinton campaign s problems on chief strategist mark penn who s harold ickes _meta_end_question_

 ickes and penn have history the history with morris goes waaaaaaaay back to the _meta_number_ref_ s when bill clinton turned to dick morris to resuscitate his presidency after the _meta_number_ref_ meltdown morris brought along a little known pollster to test out the micro ideas like school uniforms and such mark penn _meta_end_dot_

 morris was eventually tossed aside after he was caught reading polling data to his prostitute as she sucked on his toes but penn stuck around and led clinton to a resounding _meta_percent_ref_ performance against bob dole _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won reelection for three reasons because newt gingrich had overplayed his hand in trying to destroy the federal government because dole was a tired candidate and because ickes put together a hugely effective soft money operation that overwhelmed dole in the spring and summer and kept him from ever getting any momentum _meta_end_dot_

 penn believed clinton won because of the micro ideas like school uniforms _meta_end_dot_

 the conflict between them is probably ideological _meta_end_dot_

 they also apparently don t like each other _meta_end_dot_

 and warring with penn is probably for ickes a continuation by proxy of his war with morris _meta_end_dot_

 as hillary clinton s presidential campaign reaches a make or break moment in texas and ohio it seems apparent to just about everyone that the message crafted by penn for clinton has been a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 she may not have been able to beat obama regardless of what she did but once she could no longer benefit from greater name recognition and familiarity essentially after super tuesday she stopped winning races _meta_end_dot_

 and if she can t win ohio and texas five days from now she ll probably never be president _meta_end_dot_

 and harold ickes wants people to know that it s mark penn s fault _meta_end_dot_

 and he s probably right _meta_end_dot_
