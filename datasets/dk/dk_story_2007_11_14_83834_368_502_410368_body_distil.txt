  will republicans filibuster the next iraq spending bill _meta_end_question_

 depends on what you mean by filibuster i guess _meta_end_dot_

 how an actual filibuster resembles the all night debate from july i m not sure _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing if there s a filibuster going on and you re talking all night then you re filibustering _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what that thing in july was but it wasn t a filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 and it didn t resemble one either _meta_end_dot_

 the risks _meta_end_question_

 what s at stake _meta_end_question_

 a vote on a plan that ties iraq funding to the goal for troop withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 and if the republicans block the bill _meta_end_question_

 or bush vetoes it _meta_end_question_

 er ok _meta_end_dot_

 if you want the money you have to agree to a goal of troop withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t agree to it you can take the money from somewhere else _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah _meta_end_dot_

 i m feelin it _meta_end_exclamation_

 that u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate is just non stop action _meta_end_exclamation_
