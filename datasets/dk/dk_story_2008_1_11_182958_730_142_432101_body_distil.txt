  the filing deadline has passed in the great state of ohio and it has left us with a boatload of exciting races to follow and best of all we have five serious challenges to gop held seats here with only one seat to defend where we look to be in fairly good shape _meta_end_dot_

 these are the _meta_number_ref_th on defense and the _meta_number_ref_st _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_th on offense _meta_end_dot_

 in this piece i m going to focus on three of these the _meta_number_ref_st _meta_number_ref_nd and _meta_number_ref_th district races and will tackle the other three in a subsequent piece _meta_end_dot_

 these are all pretty hot races currently _meta_end_dot_

 each of them made the dccc s preliminary list of _meta_number_ref_ targeted house seats and two of them the _meta_number_ref_st and _meta_number_ref_nd districts both based in the cincinnati area were among the closest house races of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_st district gop rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve chabot narrowly fended off john cranley in _meta_number_ref_ and now has to run the gauntlet again this time against ohio house minority whip steve driehaus _meta_end_dot_

 chabot escaped narrowly in _meta_number_ref_ squeaking by democratic challenger john cranley _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in cranley s second attempt at taking out chabot _meta_end_dot_

 he s survived a number of similar challenges since his election in _meta_number_ref_ having defeated roxanne qualls _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ in addition to his two defeats of cranley _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully chabot is a cat on the last of his nine lives as anne northup was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 steve driehaus a former peace corps volunteer in senegal was one of the dccc s top recruits this cycle as cranley was in _meta_number_ref_ and is expected to perform very well in the western republican areas of this cincinnati based district which gave john kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 driehaus calls himself a fiscal moderate though he notably fought to eliminate corporate tax loopholes in the state house _meta_end_dot_

 he opposes school vouchers and the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately he also opposes abortion rights _meta_end_dot_

 the legendary second district where our old friend jean schmidt will likely face a rematch against dr _meta_end_dot_

 vic wulsin surely needs little introduction this is the second most republican district in ohio and the _meta_number_ref_th most nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 it has a cook pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ only four democrats represent redder districts and bush received a commanding _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in this district _meta_end_dot_

 however as you know we have come tantalizingly close to beating the meanest of jeans twice in the past three years paul hackett lost his now famous special election just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and wulsin lost an even closer race in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ receiving by far the most votes of any democrat in the history of the district _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully the third time is the charm for us in oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 schmidt faces a two headed primary from hamilton county commissioner phil heimlich of maneuver fame and state rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom brinkman a previous loser in the _meta_number_ref_ primary which increases her chances of initial survival as the presence of two opponents will with luck split the anti schmidt republican vote _meta_end_dot_

 this is good because the repubs chances of keeping the district increase significantly without the odious schmidt in the race _meta_end_dot_

 vic wulsin a medical doctor and graduate of harvard and case western medical school who founded a nonprofit to fight aids in africa is a solidly liberal democrat on the issues by almost any standard and for this district would be about the most progressive representative we could dream of _meta_end_dot_

 this brings us to the _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 democratic candidate bill o neill is a former judge on the ohio court of appeals _meta_end_dot_

 his opponent gop congressman steve latourette represents a swing district which went for bush _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we did not seriously contest this race in _meta_number_ref_ but the entry of o neill has made this a very competitive race _meta_end_dot_

 latourette was elected to the house in _meta_number_ref_ defeating democratic incumbent eric fingerhut _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t had an especially competitive race since then although his district is no republican stronghold _meta_end_dot_

 he purports to be a moderate he s a member of the republican main street partnership but as bill o neill himself commented on buckeye state blog o neill has run twice for the ohio supreme court refusing to accept financial contributions for his races as a symbolic gesture to oppose corruption in the ohio judicial system _meta_end_dot_

 his slogan was no money from nobody _meta_end_dot_

 not to worry though he fully intends on being financially competitive in his congressional race setting a fundraising goal of _meta_dollor_ref_ million and having raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as of september _meta_number_ref_ according to the fec _meta_end_dot_

 that s the best first quarter posting for a first time candidate in the district s history _meta_end_dot_
