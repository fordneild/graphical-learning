  bumped kos map of new hampshire in the past i have spent a bit of time looking at the demographics and voting trends of new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 though i know a bit about the state i haven t even picked up a calculator yet so consider what follows a very rough first draft of an analysis of the town by town results of yesterday s democratic primary in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 clinton appears to have won yesterday s primary in the field _meta_end_dot_

 she also appears to have pulled voters sought by the edwards campaign _meta_end_dot_

 obama did well in the areas where in _meta_number_ref_ dean did well while clinton s performance appears to have roughly mirrored kerry s _meta_end_dot_

 obama did extremely well throughout the connecticut river valley essentially the vermont border and the bucolic monadnock region east and north of keene _meta_end_dot_

 this region is the most democratic part of nh _meta_number_ref_ which is the slightly more democratic of the state s two congressional districts _meta_end_dot_

 the only area of the connecticut river valley the vermont border where clinton appears to have done better is the charlestown hinsdale winchester area in the extreme sw corner of the state which is an indication that the clinton field effort was better as that area essentially gets no nh television _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they get almost no television because of the topography and the distances from the towers so most people have cable or more likely satellite _meta_end_dot_

 and their radio is more likely to be from albany ny than from nh _meta_end_dot_

 so the voters in those towns were least likely to see broadcast advertising and the communications they received from the campaigns would have been heavily weighted to mail phones which are of much less value in new hampshire than in most places because of state law prohibiting pre recorded messages being sent to people on the do not call registry which is about _meta_percent_ref_ of the state and personal contact from campaign field workers _meta_end_dot_

 the college towns and the state capitol all went for obama but durham nh _meta_number_ref_ home of unh didn t give him much of a margin _meta_end_dot_

 students were back in town at dartmouth college in hanover and obama won hanover with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but his performance in the other college towns durham unh keene keene st and plymouth plymouth state was good but not astounding _meta_end_dot_

 there appears to have been an education income gap with obama getting the more upscale communities and clinton getting more downscale communities and boston commuter towns _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the college towns and the state capital of concord obama also did well in upscale communities like amherst bedford and bow and in the wealthy areas with lots of resorts and second homes like sunapee the lakes region and in the ski towns _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton did well in manchester and the boston bedroom towns like salem and atkinson as well as the i _meta_number_ref_ i _meta_number_ref_ corridor towns like merrimack and londonderry _meta_end_dot_

 in fact in the republican leaning areas that are made up heavily of massachusetts tax evaders she beat him solidly _meta_end_dot_

 but the most stunning examples of the socio economic gap in the electorates was in the most depressed communities of the state like claremont and especially berlin _meta_end_dot_

 these are areas where one would think edwards economic populism would fare best but both clinton _meta_percent_ref_ and obama _meta_percent_ref_ swamped him in claremont where he drew only _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in berlin clinton pulled a whopping _meta_percent_ref_ while edwards only bested obama by a single point _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 outside the college towns and concord and the outlier of the sw corner of the state the denser the population generally the better clinton performed while the sparser the population the better obama performed _meta_end_dot_

 this suggests that obama s media and messaging may have been better but clinton s field was better _meta_end_dot_

 as davidnyc discussed earlier there appears to have been a michael whouley effect which may explain why the polling was so off _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the areas where clinton performed well predominately downscale areas or the boston commuter communities and remembering that the exit polls showed a huge gender gap in favor of clinton it appears that the clinton campaign must have very deliberately and successfully boosted the turnout of middle class and working class women _meta_end_dot_

 this has always been one of her strongest demographics and seeing how strongly she performed in the middle class and more economically depressed parts of nh it appears that was her margin of victory _meta_end_dot_

 the press will be analyzing the debate or the cry and the response to it from john edwards and barack obama or bill clinton s finger waving and try to figure out what changed in the polling from saturday to tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the press will naturally do because they can t imagine something they never saw and that was independent of what was on broadcast and in the papers on sunday and monday could explain why the results were so different than the polls predicted _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely that some men who may have voted for obama shifted to republican primary to vote for mccain which would have drawn off some support for obama _meta_end_dot_

 but this win by clinton doesn t appear to have been brought about by anything else that changed in the last two days _meta_end_dot_

 no it appears at this early stage of analysis that the pieces were in place for this win all along and that the secret weapon of the clinton campaign was their field program to significantly boost turnout with their strongest demographic single women and women with less than a college degree _meta_end_dot_

 in the end one might conclude that were it not for obama s win in iowa clinton may have won by a much larger margin _meta_end_dot_

 but despite obama s win in iowa and edwards second place finish clinton had the votes of many more women already in the bag and that s what saved her in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to her field program she lives to fight another day and we now know that the campaign will go on at least through february _meta_number_ref_th and possibly well beyond _meta_end_dot_
