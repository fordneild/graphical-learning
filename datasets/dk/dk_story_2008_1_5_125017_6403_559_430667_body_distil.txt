  the filing deadline for texas march _meta_number_ref_ primary has passed and the house races in texas are starting to take form _meta_end_dot_

 the three races i would expect to be the most hotly contested are two defenses and one democratic challenge the _meta_number_ref_th district where democrats dan grant and larry joe doherty will face off for the right to challenge republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 michael mccaul who won with an unimpressive _meta_percent_ref_ against woefully underfunded democrat ted ankrum in _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_number_ref_nd district former home of tom delay and current home of democratic rep _meta_end_dot_

 nick lampson who earned national attention last year by forcing delay out of the race and subsequently winning the seat last fall and the _meta_number_ref_rd district where democratic rep _meta_end_dot_

 ciro rodriguez defeated the texas gop s golden boy former rep _meta_end_dot_

 henry bonilla in a runoff election last december _meta_end_dot_

 here i m going to focus on the two seats where democratic incumbents are facing challenges _meta_end_dot_

 republicans want to see the _meta_number_ref_ victories in both tx _meta_number_ref_ and tx _meta_number_ref_ as flukish victories brought on by exceptional circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of tx _meta_number_ref_ as i m sure you know the supremely crooked tom delay won a closer than expected primary victory looked at his internal polling numbers against lampson and bailed out _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for poor tommy texas law did not permit the republican party to replace him on the ballot so lampson got to run against a write in candidate shelley sekula gibbs and won with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote to _meta_percent_ref_ for sekula gibbs _meta_end_dot_

 absent the freakish circumstance of having to field either tom delay or a write in candidate republicans are salivating over the prospect of reclaiming this seat _meta_end_dot_

 they have no fewer than _meta_number_ref_ candidates in the race including former rep _meta_end_dot_

 sekula gibbs she won a special election to replace delay which lampson did not contest _meta_end_dot_

 the district is very republican with a cook pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush garnered _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in tx _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there are only three democratic held seats which are more strongly republican tx _meta_number_ref_ ut _meta_number_ref_ and ms _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 still lampson stands a good chance _meta_end_dot_

 working in his favor is the clusterfuck of a gop primary with _meta_number_ref_ candidates in the race it surely will get ugly _meta_end_dot_

 also lampson opted against a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate bid this year against john cornyn choosing instead to run for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 if his own polling indicated that he didn t have a good shot at being reelected i would think he would have taken a crack at the senate race _meta_end_dot_

 cq politics which has a good story up on these races ranks tx _meta_number_ref_ as leans democratic _meta_end_dot_

 in tx _meta_number_ref_ rodriguez also won a rather bizarre election in _meta_number_ref_ which no doubt fuels republican hopes that they can recapture the seat _meta_end_dot_

 rodriguez had run in tx _meta_number_ref_ initially waging a primary battle against bush dog henry cuellar and losing narrowly in the march primary _meta_end_dot_

 however he was given new life when the us supreme court ruled in june that the _meta_number_ref_ texas gerrymander violated the voting rights act partially in the construction of tx _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this enabled rodriguez to join a crowded democratic field against henry bonilla who won _meta_percent_ref_ in november _meta_number_ref_ to rodriguez s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the december runoff however rodriguez defeated bonilla _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the odd circumstances of the runoff aside this is a somewhat republican leaning district but nothing compared to tx _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 its cook pvi is r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rick perry narrowly won the district in _meta_number_ref_ and bush defeated kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the cash strapped nrcc desperate to avoid having to spend money managed to recruit a self funding millionaire attorney franciso quico canseco _meta_end_dot_

 he has already dumped over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of his own money into his campaign but of course money can t always buy you love _meta_end_dot_

 he faces a primary challenge from bexar county commissioner lyle larson _meta_end_dot_

 i know that circumstances were exceptional in _meta_number_ref_ but i do think rodriguez should be favored to win reelection _meta_end_dot_

 bonilla after all was not only a _meta_number_ref_ year incumbent but a gop rising star and he lost quite badly in the runoff _meta_end_dot_

 it was only the second time in the past _meta_number_ref_ years that a democrat had beaten a republican incumbent the other was lampson s victory over steve stockman in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so i think that rodriguez starts from a position of strength _meta_end_dot_

 cq politics also rates tx _meta_number_ref_ as leans democratic _meta_end_dot_

 additionally let us not forget the commanding advantage the dccc enjoys in fundraising compared to the anemic nrcc which should surely help us if and when these races get tight _meta_end_dot_
