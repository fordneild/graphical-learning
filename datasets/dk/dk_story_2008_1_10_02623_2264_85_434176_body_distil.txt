  new hampshire has no touchscreen voting _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 every ballot cast in new hampshire except those few cast by the handicapped is written on a piece of paper _meta_end_dot_

 it s redundant to say this after the previous comment about touchscreen voting but let s make it clear in new hampshire there is a paper trail _meta_end_dot_

 the diebold accuvote ts has been shown to be a piece of crap _meta_end_dot_

 the diebold accuvote os the machine used in new hampshire has much of the same hardware and runs much of the same tabulation software so these machines could conceivably be hacked _meta_end_dot_

 however the incentive for hacking them is not very great because unlike with the paperless voting again there s the paper trail _meta_end_dot_

 so if there were ever a recount and there was after the _meta_number_ref_ election when a survey of new hampshire voting districts chosen by the nader campaign showed there was virtually no difference between the scanned tabulation and the hand recount the malfeasance would be easily discovered _meta_end_dot_

 many folks immediately suspect that any election results they found surprising and whether they know enough about local and statewide voting patterns to be surprised is always a good question are most easily explained by malfeasance by the diebold corporation or exploitation of its machines _meta_end_dot_

 there are many problems for these folks who look for the most exotic and maybe reassuring explanation for an election result they don t like but in this case let s start out with a fairly basic one voters in every town in new hampshire cast their vote on a paper ballot and in more than half of the towns in new hampshire the paper ballots are counted by hand _meta_end_dot_

 fewer than half the towns in new hampshire tabulate votes with optical scanners _meta_end_dot_

 more than half the votes cast are counted by optical scanners as most of the bigger cities and towns including manchester nashua portsmouth concord claremont hanover keene and plymouth use the scanners _meta_end_dot_

 but more municipalities count by hand _meta_end_dot_

 and as someone relatively well versed in the voting patterns of new hampshire let me tell you there appear to be no discrepancies in the clinton obama edwards votes between the towns that tabulate votes by scanning and those that count by hand _meta_end_dot_

 obama won many of the larger towns keene hanover concord portsmouth lebanon plymouth durham _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won others manchester nashua berlin gorham claremont _meta_end_dot_

 there are reasons this makes sense as i explained in an analysis of the town by town results here _meta_end_dot_

 and where there was a strong regional pattern to the results as in the monadnock region and the connecticut river valley where obama did well or in the bedroom communities of boston where clinton did well the pattern extended geographically regardless of whether an individual town used electronic or hand tabulation _meta_end_dot_

 but ultimately there s tremendous arrogance and or ignorance at play when people assume that hillary clinton s victory in tuesday s new hampshire primary is or might be explained by election fraud _meta_end_dot_

 has it not occurred to those people who know little or nothing about voting patterns in new hampshire that the hundreds of staffers on the obama and edwards campaigns who ve immersed themselves in past voting data and models of expected vote turnouts for tuesday wouldn t these staffers have noticed discrepancies that might warrant a recount _meta_end_question_

 if tuesday s results really were the likely result of malfeasance the obama and edwards campaigns would be raising holy hell _meta_end_dot_

 they would be seeking a recount and investigation of the voting and they would be doing it because they saw the irregularities in the vote results _meta_end_dot_

 but there aren t any serious irregularities in the results of tuesday s democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won with the same kind of voters that kerry won with in _meta_number_ref_ in she did it by running strongly in the same exact areas of the state _meta_end_dot_

 diebold machines don t count the votes cast in many of the towns of new hampshire and all votes are cast on a paper ballot _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ recount showed no problems with the tabulation _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire has an excellent reputation for running clean elections _meta_end_dot_

 election administration is done on a town by town basis so rigging the election would require not just a few well placed individuals but a vast conspiracy involving hundreds of people probably more _meta_end_dot_

 and if there were strange voting patterns that showed up in discrepancies between towns that tabulated by hand vs those that tabulated the paper ballots with scanners the rival campaigns would certainly have noticed it and would be protesting the results _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton won on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 she led just about every poll every taken for _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ days leading up to the election _meta_end_dot_

 and even when she won it was only by three percentage points _meta_end_dot_

 this election wasn t rigged _meta_end_dot_

 so please ignore the diebold stole the election garbage _meta_end_dot_
