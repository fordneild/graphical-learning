  there have been several recommended diaries about the call by house judiciary committee members robert wexler tammy baldwin and luis gutierrez for the committee to actually begin hearings on the impeachment of vice president dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 but don t you find it curious that there s been literally no traditional media coverage of it _meta_end_question_

 three members of congress all on the judiciary committee call outright for impeachment hearings and no one reports it _meta_end_question_

 the three even wrote an op ed together explaining their reasoning and offered it to the new york times the washington post etc _meta_end_dot_

 no one has yet agreed to run it _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that interesting in and of itself _meta_end_question_

 i mean say what you want about impeachment but when three members of the judiciary committee sign on to a positive call for it that s worth a little news blurb don t you think _meta_end_question_

 of course it should also be noted that they wrote a _meta_number_ref_ word op ed inspired by dennis kucinich s impeachment resolution without ever mentioning dennis kucinich but that s perhaps a subject for another day _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime wexler s gathering signatures to gauge support for their call for hearings _meta_end_dot_

 interested _meta_end_question_

 drop him a line won t you _meta_end_question_

 don t be embarrassed _meta_end_dot_

 your neighbors certainly won t read about it in the paper _meta_end_dot_
