  a few days ago during the weekly news roundup on npr s diane rehm show rehm asked her guests what they thought of john kerry s endorsement of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the panelists tony blankly david corn and john harwood were a fairly sharp bunch even though blankly is a rightwing tool _meta_end_dot_

 their assessment _meta_end_question_

 didn t mean much _meta_end_dot_

 kerry was old news _meta_end_dot_

 sure he had a fundraising list to give obama but everyone knows who those donors are and obama would already have reached out to them _meta_end_dot_

 man did they miss the point _meta_end_dot_

 sure most of the big donors are known to the fundraising experts obama has on staff and to the regional fundraisers on obama s finance committee _meta_end_dot_

 but what they don t necessarily have and what the kerry list may provide is the detailed contact information that makes a cold call far more effective or helps people figure out how best to appeal to the prospective donors _meta_end_dot_

 the kerry database if he makes it fully available to obama is a treasure that even the clinton machine would envy _meta_end_dot_

 kerry raised more money in direct donations than bill clinton ever did so the number of contacts is huge _meta_end_dot_

 but with that data will come invaluable background policy interests of the donors their business background the name of their spouse and their personal assistants gatekeepers where they spend their summers who they did fundraisers with in the past cell phone numbers direct personal emails addresses and all kinds of other information _meta_end_dot_

 but lets get past that _meta_end_dot_

 those are details that make a fundraiser or campaign operative salivate but we ll forgive the journalists for not understanding the micro mechanics _meta_end_dot_

 but what they really missed is related to a much bigger trend in american political campaigns in recent years especially on the democratic side the rise of the internet and the growing importance of small donors _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ only _meta_percent_ref_ of the money donated to democratic and republican candidates was in amounts of less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but through may _meta_number_ref_ essentially the primary season over a third of the record amounts given to the presidential candidates came in small donations _meta_end_dot_

 this trend has accelerated with small donors who typically engage later in a campaign and don t contribute as large a share of the total take early in a campaign cycle already reaching _meta_number_ref_ total percentages as early as the second quarter of last year one of the best things about small donors is that their contributions are almost pure net gain here s the key to the value of kerry s databases federal campaigns must provide the federal elections commission the name address occupation and employer of donors who give more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s illegal to use information pulled directly from the fec website for fundraising solicitations _meta_end_dot_

 however there are entities that compile and enhance the fec data and provide access to the data for a fee and since it s not technically the fec it s legal to use this compiled and enhanced data for fundraising purposes _meta_end_dot_

 but donors under _meta_dollor_ref_ don t show up in any of the standard databases and nobody has a central list of the small donors to kerry s campaign except of course john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 and on thursday kerry emailed his list explaining his endorsement of obama and asking them to contribute to obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 kerry s email also demonstrates the third reason why the kerry endorsement is a huge boost to obama _meta_end_dot_

 kerry was really the first democrat nominated for president during the political maturation of the internet pdf _meta_end_dot_

 organizing online direct communications from a candidate to your email inbox online fundraising social networking none of these things were common prior to the _meta_number_ref_ campaign and john kerry became the nominee in time to assemble a massive email and online donor list currently the best held by anyone in the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 now he can communicate very inexpensively with millions of people and that email information is supplemented with other personal information like addresses and donor history _meta_end_dot_

 not only can he raise money he can deliver messages directly to known voters at a minuscule cost _meta_end_dot_

 kerry s endorsement shouldn t be overestimated _meta_end_dot_

 there are few endorsements that swing lots of votes _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the endorsements of executives governors and mayors are often more valuable than legislators even u s _meta_end_dot_

 senators because executives usually have larger staffs of operatives and better gotv networks _meta_end_dot_

 people seldom vote for someone simply because someone else they like or support says to _meta_end_dot_

 but kerry is the most recent democratic nominee and while many democrats thought he ran a less than inspiring and aggressive campaign he s generally well liked and well respected and there s little negative that comes from his endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 but the real value isn t the intangible value of john kerry saying he likes barack obama and you should too _meta_end_dot_

 the value is that it will raise lots of money for obama with little cost and provide him a means of inexpensively delivering his campaign message to voters known to be committed democrats highly likely to vote in their state s primaries _meta_end_dot_
