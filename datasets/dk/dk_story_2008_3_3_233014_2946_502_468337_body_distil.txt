  wapo captain _meta_number_ref_nd lieutenant _meta_percent_ref_ wins again _meta_end_question_

 and look what the compromise is _meta_end_exclamation_

 nope _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s not the white house compromising on the substance of the bill with congress _meta_end_dot_

 it s the congress compromising with itself on the procedure by which they ll hand the white house exactly the substance it demands _meta_end_dot_

 one vote or two _meta_end_question_

 it s your choice _meta_end_exclamation_

 see _meta_end_question_

 compromise _meta_end_exclamation_

 but at least we were treated with respect along the way yes _meta_end_question_

 i don t know what s more obnoxious _meta_end_dot_

 having to absorb millions of dollars worth of democrats are traitors attack ads while assistant ag ken wainstein grins and tells the world how healthy the process has been while reporters nod and scribble it down or the notion that the congressional democrats who have found themselves so thoroughly hobbled in their efforts to actually enforce their oversight powers would ever consider granting even more power to the executive _meta_end_dot_

 especially one that would itself require such close and vigorous oversight _meta_end_dot_

 what a joke _meta_end_dot_

 who do these people think are going to keep this power in check _meta_end_question_

 just last week the attorney general of the united states told you to stick your subpoenas up your ass _meta_end_dot_

 you now find yourselves begging a federal court to please pretty please enforce your subpoenas for you because the attorney general certified that you suck eggs _meta_end_dot_

 that attorney general gets to certify this new power is lawful and your response to this is ok what planet are you on _meta_end_question_

 at this late date in the bush administration the only truly relevant question you need to be asking yourself about any new powers or programs you re granting to the unitary executive is am i comfortable with this thing operating with absolutely zero oversight _meta_end_question_

 and only if the answer is yes should you be voting for it _meta_end_dot_

 because six plus years of experience with this president should have taught you by now that that is how it s going to operate _meta_end_dot_

 are you comfortable with allowing unlimited warrantless electronic surveillance and datamining of the communications of all americans and indeed the entire world on the say so of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush dick cheney and or david addington with no possibility that they will ever agree to answer any questions you may ever have about it _meta_end_question_

 is that not how it will work _meta_end_question_

 do you not agree that that is how you re ultimately going to have to assess it _meta_end_question_

 you can t possibly believe you re just going to be able to snap your fingers and have an open and honest hearing about it can you _meta_end_question_

 if you do please by all means tell us why _meta_end_dot_

 because you d be the only ones in the country who think so _meta_end_dot_
