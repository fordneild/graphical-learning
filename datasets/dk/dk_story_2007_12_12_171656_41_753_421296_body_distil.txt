  fourteen democratic senators including all four presidential candidates have signed onto a letter urging reid to make the fisa bill passed by the senate judiciary committee the base bill to be considered on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary bill does not contain telecom immunity and does contain a critical provision that wyden attached to the intelligence committee s version of the bill that would ensure that the same protections american citizens have from warrantless surveillance would extend to them overseas _meta_end_dot_

 from the e mailed press release no link senators feingold dodd obama sanders menendez biden brown harkin cardin clinton akaka webb kennedy and boxer signed on to the letter _meta_end_dot_

 this is a critical and welcome move by the senators particularly clinton and obama in leading on this bill _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary version of the bill undoes a lot of the damage created in the disastrous protect america act the full text of the letter is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 update unsurprising our new attorney general is all for letting the telecoms off the hook _meta_end_dot_

 he s pushing the intelligence committee version of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 the decision is reid s go with his democratic caucus or go with the administration _meta_end_dot_

 update ii i ve heard a rumor that there will be an all senate briefing with director of national intelligence admiral mcconnell and attorney general mukasey tomorrow afternoon on fisa _meta_end_dot_

 this sounds like an all out offensive by the administration on protecting the telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 call your senators and urge them to _meta_number_ref_ lobby reid to bring the judiciary committee s bill to the floor and _meta_number_ref_ tell them to oppose any bill that includes telecom anmnesty _meta_end_dot_
