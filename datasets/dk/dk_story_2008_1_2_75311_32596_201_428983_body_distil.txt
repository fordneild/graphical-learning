  allow me to confess my guilty pleasure _meta_end_dot_

 each morning having first satisfied my morning craving for a big cup of the big orange my browser wanders over the website of each presidential candidate republican and democrat alike _meta_end_dot_

 it s become a daily ritual this pilgrimage through page after page of news videos and blog posts _meta_end_dot_

 i m fascinated by the spin on these sites by how these candidates use their websites to create and maintain media narratives and how most of the time they fail to do so and by the way the candidates market themselves online _meta_end_dot_

 beyond iowa and new hampshire the vast majority of americans will never shake hands with hillary clinton or take a picture with barack obama or hear john edwards in person _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 potatohead will have had more one on one interaction with the candidates than almost all of us _meta_end_dot_

 many voters who are not news junkies like the rest of us will google candidate s x name and wander over to their website _meta_end_dot_

 that s the face of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 so i m wondering how many of you are as addicted to these websites as i am _meta_end_dot_

 do you visit them frequently _meta_end_question_

 if no why not _meta_end_question_

 if you were an undecided voter and maybe you are do you think these websites are useful _meta_end_question_

 what type of information do you think is missing _meta_end_question_

 for example pipe dream though it may be i wish candidates would at least link to their voting records _meta_end_dot_
