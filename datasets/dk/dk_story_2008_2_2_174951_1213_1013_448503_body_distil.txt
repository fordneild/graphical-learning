  former national security adviser richard clarke wrote a scathing op ed in response to bush s state of the union address _meta_end_dot_

 this portion of it is particularly important for our dem senators to keep in mind before resuming debate on the new surveillance bill monday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 the dems in the senate did at least manage to push back on the fear card long enough to get us to where we re at now an actual debate to happen on the senate floor over important amendments some of which will even get a simple up or down vote _meta_end_dot_

 it s an old theme for us unfortunately democrats so afraid that they ll be labelled weak in the face of terror that they ll roll over for any legislative tragedy should someone whisper terror in their collective ear _meta_end_dot_

 as disastrous as their capituation to it was in taking us to war in iraq their bowing to it in respects to warrantless wiretapping is just as dangerous for the long term health of the constitution and its inherent checks and balances _meta_end_dot_

 since eric lichtblau and james risen broke the story of warrantless wiretaps in december _meta_number_ref_ we ve learned enough about the program to know that national security in the wake of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ had little to do with _meta_end_dot_

 the revelations that the nsa actually began negotiation with at t as early as february _meta_number_ref_ and that at least one of these critical wiretaps lapsed because the government didn t pay its bill should be proof enough to even the most tremulous of democrats that bush and the republicans have been playing them for years _meta_end_dot_

 but they don t have to take a crazed blogger s word for it _meta_end_dot_

 a national security expert just told them so _meta_end_dot_
