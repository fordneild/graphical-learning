  that s good news for the obama folks but there s nothing real about good poll numbers _meta_end_dot_

 it will help with press and probably help with fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 but the excellent news for the obama campaign today comes from organized labor _meta_end_dot_

 organized labor has not gotten a ton of press attention this primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 with three candidates who were all good on labor there wasn t really a single labor candidate this was the state of play at the beginning of november as i explained here union endorsements can be very effective in supplementing a campaign s field and voter contact efforts _meta_end_dot_

 since edwards dropped out only clinton was benefiting from union endorsements with afscme and aft doing a great deal of field direct mail and phone contact _meta_end_dot_

 some of their work has been to their members on which they can spend dues money which like corporate money can t be given to federal candidates or federal political parties _meta_end_dot_

 they also appear to be doing a lot of independent expenditure work which cannot be coordinated with the clinton campaign and has to be paid for with pac money that members voluntarily contribute to be used for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 afscme _meta_number_ref_nd and the aft _meta_number_ref_th are among the largest unions affiliated with either the afl cio or change to win so their support to clinton should be seen as a considerable asset to her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 as of today however hillary clinton is no longer the only candidate benefiting from union endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 this afternoon the united food and commercial workers ufcw endorsed barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 and it s rumored the services employees international union seiu will soon do the same _meta_end_dot_

 now the largest seiu and _meta_number_ref_th largest ufcw affiliated unions have joined the contest against the candidate supported by the _meta_number_ref_nd and _meta_number_ref_th largest unions _meta_end_dot_

 the teamsters are the _meta_number_ref_rd largest union and while they appeared inclined to support edwards they were never able to muster a majority for the endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 some may deride ufcw and assuming they follow suit seiu for getting on board with obama now when he appears capable of securing the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that edwards supporters were keeping seiu and maybe ufcw from moving forward but edwards has been out of the contest now for over two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the case the help comes in time to make a difference for obama _meta_end_dot_

 if they hurry seiu and ufcw can probably at least do some hurried voter contact by phone and maybe in the workplace to their members in wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 but with close to three weeks to work their members in texas and especially ohio and to put people on the ground to do independent expenditure work on behalf of obama they can move votes in the states that if she doesn t win could augur the end of hillary clinton s presidential aspirations _meta_end_dot_

 update apologies to unite here who in fact endorsed obama just prior to the nevada caucuses _meta_end_dot_
