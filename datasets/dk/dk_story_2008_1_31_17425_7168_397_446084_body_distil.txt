  get ready folks _meta_end_dot_

 it s finally the waning year of the bush administration and they re going to go out in style _meta_end_dot_

 no oil field shall go untapped _meta_end_dot_

 no roadless area undisturbed _meta_end_dot_

 no threatened or endangered species unmolested _meta_end_dot_

 they ve got just _meta_number_ref_ short months to put their mark on what s left of the nation s wilderness and they re coming for it _meta_end_dot_

 last week while everyone was distracted by a faltering worldwide economy and freefalling markets the administration made alaska the target of it s renewed renovation _meta_end_dot_

 it snuck through something called the chuckchi sea oil and gas lease sale _meta_number_ref_ and opened up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million acres of the state s tongass national forest to logging and road building _meta_end_dot_

 they must have something against bears _meta_end_dot_

 as my friend joel connelly points out the chukchi sea sale covers about half of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 polar bear population s essential habitat _meta_end_dot_

 of course the polar bear isn t yey considered an endangered species because another arm of the interior department fish and wildlife have decided to delay making a decision on a polar bear listing _meta_end_dot_

 anyone else smell something fishy _meta_end_question_

 not at all says the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 we had to delay making our decision because we got all this new information about just how dire the global situation for polar bears is _meta_end_dot_

 no really that s their excuse _meta_end_dot_

 the reports from the usgs showing that the polar bears are likely to be gone in the next generation actually propel the bush administration not to rush to protect the animals but to rush to open up what s left of their literally shrinking habitat to potentially devastating oil and gas development _meta_end_dot_

 there s a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not all _meta_end_dot_

 alaska s brown bear population might have to start getting a little cozier with one another as their habitat gets sliced up by roads and clearcuts _meta_end_dot_

 in another assault on alaska last week the administration released a management plan for the tongass national forest that will open millions of acres of currently wild and roadless federal land to logging and road building _meta_end_dot_

 there s just over half a million acres that has valuable timber and the whole _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million acreage is being opened for road building _meta_end_dot_

 well that pretty much sums up the bush administration s ability to do math _meta_end_dot_

 remember when the iraq war was going to cost less than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_question_

 money has everything to do with _meta_end_dot_

 our money _meta_end_dot_

 the new management plan for the tongass will effectively raise no revenue for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government as the u s _meta_end_dot_

 taxpayers will have to pay to build the roads the timber companies need to access the forest _meta_end_dot_

 in connelly s words in _meta_number_ref_ the u s _meta_end_dot_

 forest service spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million on its tongass timber sales program and received back just _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million from timber companies that s not much of a return on investment _meta_end_dot_

 but this crowd is happy to bankrupt the us treasury as we ve seen time and time again as long as their buddies in the private sector get just a little bit richer _meta_end_dot_

 good news for a very wealthy few and bad news for bears _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at new west _meta_end_dot_
