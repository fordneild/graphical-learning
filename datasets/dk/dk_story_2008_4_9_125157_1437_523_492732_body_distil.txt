  ever wonder what the nrcc s answer to the dccc s red to blue program is _meta_end_question_

 well strictly speaking they don t have one at least not one that s publicly shared _meta_end_dot_

 but they re working hard on that _meta_end_dot_

 house minority leader john boehner does though and he s even come up with a clever acronym _meta_end_dot_

 he s entitled it the regain our majority program or romp _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ah what a comedian _meta_end_dot_

 romp _meta_number_ref_ has recently released the third instalment in its list of candidates favored for assistance the first update to their list in calendar year _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i found it rather instructive as to gop priorities and i ve posted it below notice that this romp program ostensibly focused on regaining the republican majority seems disproportionately tilted towards protecting incumbent republican reps _meta_end_dot_

 in fact out of these _meta_number_ref_ districts where the elephants hope to romp exactly one is currently held by a democrat john yarmuth of kentucky s _meta_number_ref_rd district _meta_end_dot_

 i find this to be a novel and fascinating method of regaining their majority by not targeting democratic held seats _meta_end_dot_

 i wish them the best of luck with this i m sure it s going to work out just splendidly _meta_end_dot_

 keep avoiding the dem held seats and they oughta have that ol majority back in no time flat _meta_end_dot_

 i m also intrigued by the specific republican seats that the rompers decided were particularly endangered _meta_end_dot_

 i m not at all surprised by the open seats in mn _meta_number_ref_ and nm _meta_number_ref_ and listing graves keller and walberg makes a lot of sense to me as well _meta_end_dot_

 but some of the others listed show just how desperate things are getting for the grand old pustules _meta_end_dot_

 they need to swoop in and help out bill sali _meta_end_question_

 already _meta_end_question_

 id _meta_number_ref_ has a pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s the _meta_number_ref_th most republican district around _meta_end_dot_

 i know bill sali is just an absolute idiot but really what does it say about the gop s electoral hopes that six months before the general election they re worried about districts like this one _meta_end_question_

 the same goes for ohio s _meta_number_ref_nd home of mean jean schmidt _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i understand this one schmidt is a walking nightmare of a candidate who has single handedly made this district competitive in two consecutive elections but still things are so rosy for house republicans that they re already trying to figure out how to protect r _meta_number_ref_ districts _meta_end_question_

 splendid _meta_end_dot_

 as for ny _meta_number_ref_ it s a pretty friendly district for democrats i grant _meta_end_dot_

 but vito fossella has never received fewer than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote and boehner s folks are already worrying about him _meta_end_question_

 in simple terms the regain our majority program is not actually focused on regaining the republican majority but on preventing democratic pickups in second tier races _meta_end_dot_

 they won t admit this but their targeted races indicate that that s exactly what they re doing _meta_end_dot_

 from the cq article actions speak louder than words rep _meta_end_dot_

 boehner and your actions seem to indicate just how optimistic you really are about regaining a house majority _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want to strain credulity and destroy the remaining shreds of your credibility by insisting that you re going to gain seats this year well that s your hangup _meta_end_dot_
