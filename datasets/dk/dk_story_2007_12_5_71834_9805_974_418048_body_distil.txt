  today the supreme court will hear arguments in yet another case concerning the right of men held at guant namo prison to appeal for their freedom _meta_end_dot_

 the military commissions act rushed through last year by the republican congress was drafted so as to deny them the right _meta_end_dot_

 the court has earlier ruled in rasul and again in hamdan that the prisoners had to be given the right to challenge their detention which the bush administration has sought to frustrate by various devices _meta_end_dot_

 the mca is only the latest such stunt _meta_end_dot_

 it denies the prisoners habeas corpus rights by stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear their appeals and substituting a new ad hoc military court system _meta_end_dot_

 in these military commissions the accused has very limited rights and cannot appeal for his freedom even if the prosecution fails to win its case _meta_end_dot_

 the appeal before scotus today backed by a broad coalition of liberal conservative and libertarian groups as well as many distinguished lawyers represents a last attempt to force the bush administration to permit the prisoners to seek justice _meta_end_dot_

 it is an exceptionally important case in a variety of ways some of them quite fundamental for the relationship between the executive legislative and judicial branches _meta_end_dot_

 the legal issues are admirably summarized by marty lederman i ll leave the larger legal issues aside however _meta_end_dot_

 what i want to consider is the background in which this case arose _meta_end_dot_

 these questions can easily be overlooked but they re very telling what is the nature of the allegations against boumediene and al odah _meta_end_question_

 what is the actual evidence _meta_end_question_

 and inevitably these resolve themselves into this question why should the bush administration any longer be trusted _meta_end_question_

 consider how the bush administration frames the issue as one in which the prisoners at guant namo have been granted if anything too many rights _meta_end_dot_

 on the face of it this is both preposterous and obnoxious _meta_end_dot_

 as published reports have stated for several years and as wells dixon an attorney for the center for constitutional rights confirmed to me just the other day large numbers of prisoners at guant namo are suffering from the most extreme psychological degradation imaginable _meta_end_dot_

 their minds are disintegrating _meta_end_dot_

 they are becoming so distant from reality that it is harder and harder for them to cooperate with counsel in their own defense _meta_end_dot_

 many initially believed that the american justice system would right the wrong of their imprisonment in short order _meta_end_dot_

 and as years have dragged on without any apparent progress they have lost all hope _meta_end_dot_

 they see no future for themselves except as playthings of an indifferent and amoral system of oppression _meta_end_dot_

 but let s pretend for a moment that the administration actually believes what it is pleading in court a ridiculous notion in many instances i know but bear with me _meta_end_dot_

 and let s measure mr _meta_end_dot_

 clement s assertion against the facts _meta_end_dot_

 the bbc provides profiles of their cases _meta_end_dot_

 first there is fawzi al odah a kuwaiti who traveled to afghanistan in august of _meta_number_ref_ to do charity work _meta_end_dot_

 caught up in the chaos during the fall invasion of that country he hid out and then fled to the pakistan border _meta_end_dot_

 to be more precise al odah was captured by bounty hunters and sold to the us _meta_end_dot_

 like so many other prisoners he is essentially a victim of an idiotic system created by the bush administration to offer bounties for any unspecified terrorists whom people in remote areas in e g _meta_end_dot_

 afghanistan might seize and hand over _meta_end_dot_

 this created a market for humans _meta_end_dot_

 what quickly arose inevitably was a human trafficking network _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 al odah was essentially enslaved by bounty hunters who were grabbing any foreigner they could lay their hands on _meta_end_dot_

 so mr _meta_end_dot_

 clement s claim that he is a captured enemy combatant really ought to be put to the test in a court of law don t you think _meta_end_question_

 as for mr _meta_end_dot_

 boumediene yet another prisoner whose seizure cannot remotely be associated with combat _meta_end_dot_

 but then professor mark denbeaux s study at seton hall long ago demonstrated conclusively that only a tiny proportion of prisoners at gitmo were actually captured by american personnel _meta_end_dot_

 the rest were handed over or sold to the us _meta_end_dot_

 this study is a reference point for any discussion of guant namo prison a topic of almost endless debate for years now _meta_end_dot_

 it s a great shame so few americans have actually read it _meta_end_dot_

 update a superb diary on these cases was posted by the maven who modestly describes it in the comments as a complement to this piece _meta_end_dot_

 it provides an overview of the development of the cases and links to the briefs submitted to the court _meta_end_dot_

 top notch work from an outstanding diarist _meta_end_dot_
