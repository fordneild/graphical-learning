  yesterday sen _meta_end_dot_

 feingold met with a handful of bloggers to talk about critical issues facing the senate and at the top of the list was of course fisa _meta_end_dot_

 he took us to task gently for focusing the fight on telco amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 he was right to do so _meta_end_dot_

 speaking for myself i focused on this aspect because it was the guaranteed poison pill of the bill if it wasn t included bush would veto _meta_end_dot_

 this seemed the most straightforward of the myriad of issues to explain and to rally people behind and to get the democrats in the senate to finally stand up to the administration _meta_end_dot_

 it s worked so far but senator feingold is absolutely correct in that we need to really understand the scope of the problems both in the paa and in the bill currently pending before the senate _meta_end_dot_

 senator feingold discussed these problems with us a few weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 and he reiterated them to us yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 here s what else there is that democrats are fighting for against the republicans in trying to get their amendments considered the senate passed the house s _meta_number_ref_ day extension of the protect america act that was set to expire tomorrow night _meta_end_dot_

 many would have liked to see the paa just expire _meta_end_dot_

 on this i agree with what sen _meta_end_dot_

 feingold said in his diary the senate leadership negotiations over how many amendments and how they will be allowed to proceed is ongoing _meta_end_dot_

 our job is to keep the pressure on them to fix the overreach of the intel bill and the paa _meta_end_dot_

 not all of the amendments being offered are optimal by any means _meta_end_dot_

 i d far rather see no amnesty at all than the specter whitehouse alternative because the telcos don t deserve to be let off the hook for knowingly breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 but it would hold the administration accountable _meta_end_dot_

 all of these amendments would provide what as most been lacking in the past seven years oversight _meta_end_dot_

 here is the group of senators led by rockefeller most likely to cave to republican pressure on preventing these amendments from coming to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 contact them and your own senators and tell them that all of the fisa amendments deserve an up or down vote on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein s phone number now correct _meta_end_dot_
