  obama continues picking up key senate endorsements this week _meta_end_dot_

 this time it s the conservative leaning senator from nebraska ben nelson _meta_end_dot_

 from the omaha world herald as of today obama s january endorsements include that is a pretty impressive list _meta_end_dot_

 contrast that with hillary s endorsements in january i d say obama is winning the endorsement war in these crucial final weeks _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s list is longer but i don t believe the former governor from missouri _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ has quite the influence he once had _meta_end_dot_

 the question is will the endorsements matter to voters _meta_end_question_

 we ll see soon enough _meta_end_dot_
