  no redo in florida _meta_end_dot_

 here s how you seat them you cut them in half for breaking the rules like the gop did and then you assign them _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ each to obama and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 presto _meta_end_exclamation_

 issue solved _meta_end_dot_

 would work with michigan too _meta_end_dot_

 states and future candidates need to know that the rules will be enforced _meta_end_dot_

 if they are not there s no way we can enforce a new calendar without new hampshire and iowa at the head _meta_end_dot_

 they ll break the rules and candidates fearful that the results will count will have no choice but to campaign defeating the purpose of the new calendar _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who wants our primary calendar reformed can t possibly allow michigan and florida to be seated as is _meta_end_dot_
