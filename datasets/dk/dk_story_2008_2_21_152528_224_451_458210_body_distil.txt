  if yesterday was all about what you can get away with without a functioning federal election commission today s about the downside of an absence of a functioning fec for a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 because if you need four votes for the fec to do anything you might also need those four votes for it to not do something as john mccain has now learned _meta_end_dot_

 see john mccain sent the fec a letter purporting to withdraw from public financing for the primaries despite his earlier submission for and certification of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 fec chairman david mason a republican and one of two remaining commissioners has written back to sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain translation john mccain you re still locked in to the matching funds system at least until the senate fills some of the fec vacancies _meta_end_dot_

 given that by january _meta_number_ref_ maverick had already spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the estimated _meta_dollor_ref_m which would be his limit between now and the convention under the matching funds program _meta_end_dot_

 umm yeah that s a problem and i foresee a great many packets of ramen noodle soup in his campaign s immediate future _meta_end_dot_

 the letter goes on to make an even more important point that mccain still must explain to the commission s satisfaction why his use of the certifications and potential future certifications in obtaining the bank loans did not already commit him to the matching funds program a point i highlighted on monday _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall explains it indeed _meta_end_dot_

 would you sign a pledge with this man _meta_end_question_
