  from the diaries kos i ll start by showing the permanent republican majority in its current form in the house the distribution of seats according to the percent of the vote bush had in _meta_number_ref_ in each district _meta_end_dot_

 i ve added a smooth curve through the data click to enlarge _meta_end_dot_

 here s the distribution of democratic house seats click to enlarge _meta_end_dot_

 the blue wave of the democrats is clearly eroding that red cliff _meta_end_dot_

 and there s a good _meta_number_ref_ or so republicans some in oh so carefully gerrymandered districts teetering right on the edge _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like a couple dozen have fallen in _meta_end_dot_

 below the evolution of the house from _meta_number_ref_ to today and a bit about redistricting _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at open left and swing state project _meta_end_dot_
