  the delegates continue to stream in that s two delegates previously assigned to clinton now shipped over to obama making it a _meta_number_ref_ delegate shift in obama s favor _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile final certified results in colorado and new york favored clinton she got four new delegates in colorado previously unassigned and an extra one out of new york _meta_end_dot_

 per obama s math he loses two votes in colorado negating the illinois additions while his math was already spot on in new york _meta_end_dot_

 clinton however picked up three new super delegates helping her offset the loss of spitzer _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t been able to find out who those three were _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile don t look now but it looks like we have two more debates coming one in pensylvania _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the other in north carolina _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ assuming clinton accepts the latter _meta_end_dot_

 me i m sick of debates _meta_end_dot_
