  last week s republican primary brought us reports of malfunctioning machines and human error throughout the state _meta_end_dot_

 indeed at the start of voting last week _meta_percent_ref_ of voting machines in horry county didn t work properly _meta_end_dot_

 human error compounded the confusion _meta_end_dot_

 state officials promised to fix the problems before today s primary and so far it looks like things are running much smoother this time around
