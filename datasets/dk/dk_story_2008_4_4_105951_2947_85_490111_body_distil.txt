  hillary clinton is against the proposed bilateral trade deal with colombia _meta_end_dot_

 so it makes perfect sense that mark penn met with the colombian ambassador to tell him _meta_end_dot_

 that he favors the trade deal _meta_end_dot_

 how can that be that hillary s top surrogate was out supporting a deal she s against _meta_end_question_

 ah for that you need mark penn s collection of invisible hats _meta_end_dot_

 so penn wasn t wearing his clinton camp top bs artist hat he was wearing his smarmy lobbyist against us workers hat _meta_end_dot_

 how nice it must be to have such a collection of invisible hats that no matter what you re up to you always have an excuse _meta_end_dot_

 a good thing too because without those hats penn would come off as a cynical jerkwad who would sell out anyone or anything just to put another buck in his pocket _meta_end_dot_

 and then hillary would be putting her campaign in the hands of someone whose beliefs are no deeper than the oil stain on top of a mud puddle _meta_end_dot_
