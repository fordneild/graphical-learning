  stan greenberg who along with james carville does the democracy corps series of polling also happens to be rahm emanuel s right hand guy and chief ally in the effort to push the democratic caucus and its candidates running for office to the far right and out of the mainstream on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 a vocal bipartisan minority is obsessed about immigration but the vast bipartisan majority of americans believe in comprehensive immigration reform that secures our border while providing a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly americans of all political stripes have reached that conclusion despite the loud demonizations of brown people by right wing hate radio the likes of lou dobbs and the tom tancredos and rahm emanuels in dc without any significant push back _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore as we have seen now two cycles in a row immigration is not an electoral killer _meta_end_dot_

 it s an issue yes and it must be addressed _meta_end_dot_

 but do democrats suffer short term pain by standing for sensible immigration reform _meta_end_question_

 the same reform championed by the likes of george bush harry reid john mccain nancy pelosi the catholic church many evangelical denominations and lots more groups on both sides of the ideological divide _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 the results in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ speak for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 and long term it s a path to a dominant progressive majority _meta_end_dot_
