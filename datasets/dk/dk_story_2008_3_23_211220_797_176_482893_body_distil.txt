  did you see brian dipalma s the untouchables _meta_end_question_

 there s a great scene with sean connery as the tough irish cop jim malone challenging do gooder elliot ness to recognize that to take down al capone you have to fight by a different set of rules to beat the republicans and beat them good democrats need to recognize that it s going to take a war on multiple fronts _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is cultural _meta_end_dot_

 culturally the democrats are a center hip party while the republicans are an extreme unhip party _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are so extreme as to be beyond compromise _meta_end_dot_

 remember their vision of culture and entertainment is so extreme that at the _meta_number_ref_ republican convention in philadelphia their musical headliners included chubby checker bobby rydell and fabian _meta_end_dot_

 their revered entertainers and cultural figures include chuck norris bo derek and tanya tucker _meta_end_dot_

 the closest they get to having humorists who are actually funny is probably p j _meta_end_dot_

 o rourke who about _meta_number_ref_ years ago wrote how to drive fast on drugs while getting your wing wang squeezed and not spill your drink but that was written almost _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 besides o rourke is really more of a libertarian entertainer than a republican or a movement conservative _meta_end_dot_

 so never mind they don t have any humorists who are funny intentionally _meta_end_dot_

 many people frame our current politics as an epic war between good and evil light and darkness like something out of lord of the rings _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know that i d go that far but it is an article of my political faith that there s no compromise with a party that attracts the reverence of both pat boone and ted nugent _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are losing young voters _meta_end_dot_

 there are many more substantive reasons young voters are trending democratic but it helps us that most voters see the republicans as incredibly un hip _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans hate gays they love crap and their idea of new and edgy is the osmond family _meta_end_dot_

 thus anything that reinforces the association of republicans with cultural products that are tired stale _meta_number_ref_ years out of date or just plain bad will help us win in november _meta_end_dot_

 therefore i m happy to see that somewhere some democrats decided to bring a gun to the cultural knife fight by producing and disseminating horrifically bad youtube videos that are so awful that they couldn t possibly be the honest product of people who really do like john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s great to see democrats putting out something that will cause a backlash against mccain by emphasizing that the closest the republicans have gotten to hip in the last _meta_number_ref_ years was probably when richard nixon met with late era peanut butter and nanner sandwiches eating elvis _meta_end_dot_

 as an example of an apparent dirty tricks campaign by some democrat somewhere i present you with this i mean that s not real is it _meta_end_question_

 it is fake right _meta_end_question_

 right_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_question_
