 for weeks after the astonishment of september _meta_number_ref_ she repeatedly told everyone within earshot at work family gatherings the supermarket wherever that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should nuke the attackers and any of their friends _meta_end_dot_

 she says now this isn t so _meta_end_dot_

 she also says she wholeheartedly opposed the invasion of iraq even though she spoke favorably of the war and occasionally mister bush up until about december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 she s _meta_number_ref_ but hasn t given up high decibel tantrums when challenged so treasuring my eardrums i let it ride _meta_end_dot_

 but she reminded me of what there seems to be quite a lot of these days call it convenient misremembering _meta_end_dot_
