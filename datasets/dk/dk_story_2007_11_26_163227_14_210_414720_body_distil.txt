  mississippi republicans are in a bind _meta_end_dot_

 first lott wants out by the end of this year so new ethics guidelines that prohibit former members of congress from lobbying for two years rather than one _meta_end_dot_

 and we all know that lott is ditching the people of mississippi so he can cash in on k street _meta_end_dot_

 he admitted it _meta_end_dot_

 so lott needs to be out by dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however if he does that mississippi law requires a special election within _meta_number_ref_ days and a low turnout special might hurt the gop _meta_end_dot_

 they want the presidential race to boost republican turnout in a state that leans heavily republican in presidential elections _meta_end_dot_

 so what will win lott s desire to cash out asap or the gop s desire to maximize their possibilities of holding that seat _meta_end_question_

 well if you re a republican there s always option _meta_number_ref_ lie and obfuscate the law and try to pull a fast one on everyone else ha ha ha that haley _meta_end_dot_

 such a joker _meta_end_dot_

 the law you get that _meta_end_question_

 the law essentially mandates a special election within _meta_number_ref_ days of the retirement _meta_end_dot_

 barbour is trying to argue that the key point is the proclamation not the date the vacancy occurs _meta_end_dot_

 as election law expert rick hasen notes and the hill reports that ms s secretary of state a democrat until the winners of the _meta_number_ref_ elections get sworn in later in january agrees _meta_end_dot_

 lott will have a choice to make suck it up and wait an extra year before cashing out on k street or screw his party over one last time _meta_end_dot_

 and if barbour persists on trying to rewrite state law he ll have to likely justify his efforts in a court of law _meta_end_dot_
