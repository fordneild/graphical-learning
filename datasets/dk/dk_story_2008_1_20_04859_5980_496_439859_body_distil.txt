  disconcerting _meta_end_dot_

 who came up with these rules _meta_end_question_

 first of all if clinton won the popular vote and that s an assumption since we have no popular vote tally yet then she should have a majority of the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 just like in iowa second place john edwards should ve had more delegates than third place hillary clinton he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 but once you get those delegates they should be obligated to support their pledged candidate _meta_end_dot_

 at the county and state conventions those delegates aren t there to vote for the nominee that nevadans support _meta_end_dot_

 they re there to vote for the nominee they ve been pledged to support _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bullshit nonsensical system _meta_end_dot_

 and i look forward once this process is finished to a comprehensive look at reforming our primary process _meta_end_dot_
