  while the clinton campaign steps up its efforts to ratify the sham elections in michigan and florida their lone lifeline in a campaign they have otherwise thoroughly lost on the merits they seek to disenfranchise actual voters in a real contest that in texas _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday then on thursday of course it doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 clinton originally agreed to the sanctions against michigan and florida _meta_end_dot_

 yet now even after the states have admitted they don t have the money time or political will to get new sanctioned contests the clinton campaign clings to the states in an effort to spread enough uncertainty to keep her failed campaign alive _meta_end_dot_

 note that in texas sd _meta_number_ref_ in dallas is little different than sd _meta_number_ref_ in houston clinton got only about _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote and only about _meta_number_ref_ percent in the caucus _meta_end_dot_

 she s in danger of failing to reach viability there and in houston s sd _meta_number_ref_ and those are huge districts _meta_end_dot_

 note also that the district which the clinton campaign is trying to disenfranchise is essentially half african american half latino _meta_end_dot_

 but every delegate counts and sd _meta_number_ref_ has six of them _meta_end_dot_

 they ll fight for every single one of them no matter how many people and communities they disenfranchise _meta_end_dot_

 there are also reports that several south texas counties clinton territory are refusing to publish the location of the conventions _meta_end_dot_

 in the old day no one showed up to these things delegate slates were just filled in without hassle by some local party honcho _meta_end_dot_

 these people would like nothing else than to fill in a full slate of clinton delegates without the hassles of democracy and all _meta_end_dot_

 so between credential challenges and other subterfuge designed to depress obama s performance and cast the caucus results in doubt we ll see that once again camp clinton will do and say anything in its mad pursuit of power _meta_end_dot_
