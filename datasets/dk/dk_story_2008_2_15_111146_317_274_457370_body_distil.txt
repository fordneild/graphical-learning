  we ve seen the past two years the immigration issue doesn t decide elections and that even a majority of republicans aren t frothing in the mouth about it _meta_end_dot_

 to wit virginia where republicans based their entire _meta_number_ref_ off year state legislative election strategy on demonizing immigrants the primary exit polls for republican voters showed this page two that is the most hard core republicans the ones who bothered to turn out in a year when republicans are mostly staying home are more likely to support ways to keep undocumented immigrants in this country than they are to demand deportation _meta_end_dot_

 not that it s stopped rahm emanuel from continuing his efforts to the democratic caucus to the right on the issue obsessed with the notion that this is somehow a new third rail of american politics _meta_end_dot_

 but third rails kill _meta_end_dot_

 and if anyone is about to get burned by anti immigrant sentiment it s the gop _meta_end_dot_

 and that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent breakdown includes the numbers in florida _meta_number_ref_r _meta_number_ref_d and michigan _meta_number_ref_r _meta_number_ref_d neither of which held a real democratic primary so the republicans made up a little ground in those states _meta_end_dot_

 had democrats actually turned out in those states for a real election the democratic advantage among latinos would ve been even larger than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ overall _meta_end_dot_

 even in arizona mccain s home state the breakdown was _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_r _meta_end_dot_

 in a state that is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ latino as of _meta_number_ref_ that s the sort of disadvantage that republicans can ill afford to have _meta_end_dot_

 and the more virulently anti immigrant their rhetoric the more lopsided those democratic advantages become _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of those great times that doing the right thing is also the best politics _meta_end_dot_

 rahm s jihad against immigrants isn t based on the numbers _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers are clear _meta_end_dot_

 if he persists there can be only one other explanation _meta_end_dot_
