  you may or may not have heard of bilal hussein _meta_end_dot_

 for the past _meta_number_ref_ months he s been held without charges for allegedly helping the insurgency in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the pentagon isn t you see keen on photojournalists that aren t embedded on its side of the occupation _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago hussein finally got a hearing in an iraqi court although his lawyers still have not been given copies of the material they need to defend him _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the usual coterie of right wing blogobuffoons including michele malkin had a field day talking about propaganda photographs and aiding the insurgents in iraq who are of course by definition each and every one a terrorist hussein works for the ap and was arrested in ramadi on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t until september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that a public announcement was made regarding his incarceration without charge _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military said they were turning him over to iraqi judges for trial _meta_end_dot_

 his photograph on the right which is possibly one of those that caused him to be arrested was part of a package of _meta_number_ref_ associated press photographs which won the _meta_number_ref_ pulitzer prize for breaking news photography _meta_end_dot_

 it depicts four insurgents in fallujah firing a mortar and small arms during the u s _meta_end_dot_

 offensive there in november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on december _meta_number_ref_ tim arango of the new york times wrote about the charges against hussein if hussein asked the triggerman to delay exploding the improvised explosive device until he adjusted his lens or some similar such action a case could be made that he went well beyond the bounds of professional behavior as a photojournalist _meta_end_dot_

 if he did so _meta_end_dot_

 but if u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials thought this accredited prize sharing journalist had conspired with the men they re calling terrorists why has it taken them so long to get him into court _meta_end_question_

 this utter contempt for due process and human rights is of course just one more example of the boatload of u s _meta_end_dot_

 actions that the thugs now running our country have visited on the world in the past seven years _meta_end_dot_

 bilal hussein s ordeal is not over _meta_end_dot_

 scott horton at harper s writes as we ve learned the hard way since september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they d like to do everything in the dark especially in places like fallujah where hussein took this shot after u s _meta_end_dot_

 air strikes on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t have quite the warm and fuzzy cachet as photos of a dictator s statue being pulled into the dirt an event that was uh huh spontaneous and unplanned _meta_end_dot_

 overnight news digest _meta_end_dot_

 and if you want a good christmas eve story see kid oakland s reprise at the top of the recommended diary list _meta_end_dot_
