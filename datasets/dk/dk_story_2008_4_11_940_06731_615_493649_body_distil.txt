  time s michael scherer asks has mccain flip flopped on torture _meta_end_question_

 simple answer to a simple question yes _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he sponsored the detainee treatment act dta that prohibited military interrogators from inflicting cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon prisoners by limiting interrogation techniques to those approved in the us army field manual _meta_end_dot_

 however mccain was nearly silent as the grave when george bush attached a signing statement to the law that neutered it _meta_end_dot_

 since then he has not joined others in congress who are pushing for the dta to be tightened and expanded _meta_end_dot_

 in particular while campaigning in ohio on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain urged bush to veto a democratic bill that would have extended the coverage of the dta to cia personnel who frequently interrogate prisoners held by the military at guantanamo as well as at secret prisons around the world _meta_end_dot_

 bush did veto the bill on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so it s abundantly clear that mccain has flip flopped on torture _meta_end_dot_

 for all his preening on the issue he has backed down shamefully in the face of bush s intransigence _meta_end_dot_

 last month demfromct highlighted mccain s flip flops on torture o ddly michael scherer manages to reach the opposite conclusion from the truth _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to mccain scandals scherer has staked out that territory before _meta_end_dot_

 referring to the democratic bill that mccain rejects scherer states my emphasis further restriction interesting phrase we know of no legal restrictions on cia interrogation techniques at least none that the cia accepts as binding on it _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration long ago tossed aside federal anti torture statute and international treaties banning torture and abuse _meta_end_dot_

 scherer is pretending that the cia s claim that it is not now using waterboarding constitutes a restriction _meta_end_dot_

 even if he s gullible enough to take the cia s word without proof the term he s looking for is pause _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pause in waterboarding since the white house has stated it does not rule out a resumption of that torture technique _meta_end_dot_

 so how in the world can mccain s opposition to the democratic bill be described as a continuation of a position he took in _meta_number_ref_ when he introduced the dta _meta_end_question_

 this is where scherer s argument jumps several levels on the absurdity scale and enters the rarified realm of sheer perversity yes time has identified damning evidence _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s original draft of the dta tried to extend its applicability to the cia and all other government officials but he backed down in the face of opposition and restricted the bill to the military _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic bill vetoed in march by bush would have instituted the across the board restrictions that mccain originally sought _meta_end_dot_

 but now mccain doesn t want them _meta_end_dot_

 and scherer tells us that is not a flip flop _meta_end_dot_

 chiz _meta_end_dot_

 what would mccain have to do to get the traditional media to acknowledge his hard earned reputation for flip flopping _meta_end_question_

 this article is a start but its candor is remarkable only because of its rarity _meta_end_dot_

 update by some technological quirk the original post was an older draft rather than the final one _meta_end_dot_

 i ve now posted the version that should have appeared which differs only by adding a few further phrases and links in the second and last paragraphs _meta_end_dot_
