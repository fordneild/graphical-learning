  primary year starts off seeming like a fun opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 the chance to see all the democratic candidates in person _meta_end_question_

 to bypass long cold lines by marching straight up to the press check in _meta_end_question_

 to interview a couple of the candidates _meta_end_question_

 sweet _meta_end_exclamation_

 little do you know that eventually you ll be on the phone to someone saying yeah candidate s name has an event a quarter mile from here but i m burned out on that stuff i d rather work the first presidential candidate i wrote about was mike gravel _meta_end_dot_

 this was back before the debates when gravel was doing poorly attended retail politics in new hampshire and i wrote about him mostly to take a shot at john mccain s maverick reputation _meta_end_dot_

 next up chris dodd who unfortunately did not show the fire that would come to characterize his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 when john edwards came to town i got to interview elizabeth but never wrote about john _meta_end_dot_

 there were a lot of edwards events i never wrote about in fact perhaps because i liked him and it made it more difficult to think through my reactions publicly _meta_end_dot_

 i had similar trouble with barack obama though the third or fourth time i saw him campaign i figured something out _meta_end_dot_

 i had no trouble writing about dennis kucinich and did an interview with bill richardson _meta_end_dot_

 for some reason i never came up with anything to say about joe biden or hillary clinton when i went to their events _meta_end_dot_

 not envy newspaper reporters who have to write about the same old stump speech day after day _meta_end_dot_

 but then the end of the year comes _meta_end_dot_

 the primary is just a month or so away and candidates start rolling out their new stump speeches and bringing in celebrity endorsers _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you go see oprah stump for obama i didn t or bonnie raitt and jackson browne for edwards i did they did an event _meta_number_ref_ minutes from me picture by blue hampshire diarist sirius _meta_end_dot_

 and then at the end it s just all consuming _meta_end_dot_
