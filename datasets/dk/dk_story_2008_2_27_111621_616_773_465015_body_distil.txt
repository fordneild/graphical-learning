  remember those lost white house emails that were sent through republican national committee servers even though they dealt with official business _meta_end_question_

 and remember how in all last year waxman held hearings and made demands that the rnc turn over those emails _meta_end_question_

 i ll give you one guess what almost a year later the rnc now says about that _meta_end_question_

 oh wait _meta_end_dot_

 i gave it away in the title _meta_end_dot_

 but here read it for yourself oh ok _meta_end_dot_

 it no longer plans to _meta_end_dot_

 oversight _meta_end_exclamation_

 yee ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 those emails contain white house records that by law must be preserved _meta_end_dot_

 of course only the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush administration has the gall to ask by law or else what and the answer from congress _meta_end_question_

 or else we ll write sternly worded letters tm that s what not only must those records be preserved but those records are believed to contain the paper trails of the us attorneys purge the illegal gsa political briefings and just possibly the don siegelman vendetta _meta_end_dot_

 time is ticking away on the _meta_number_ref_th congress the one elected to once and for all provide oversight of this rogue administration to get anything done _meta_end_dot_

 we can all appreciate the work that s been done in exposing the wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 still at bottom the question is whether or not you feel well served by the oversight and the subpoena power that you were promised was the single most important thing that would come from a democratic takeover of congress _meta_end_dot_

 so do you _meta_end_question_

 or do you think there s work yet to be done _meta_end_question_

 the house just recently decided after eight long months by the way that it d had enough of the white house simply declining to comply with the law and with their subpoenas and voted to hold harriet miers and josh bolten in contempt _meta_end_dot_

 more on that later the senate though has not yet joined in pulling its weight in this fight which after all is between the entire congress and the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 not just the ones who are willing to stand up _meta_end_dot_

 the senate s prerogatives and therefore the power of both democrats and republicans are just as much in question as are the house s _meta_end_dot_

 and yet although the senate judiciary committee has voted to approve contempt citations including one for karl rove who now sits squarely at the center of the don siegelman fiasco even as the house has acted the senate has not _meta_end_dot_

 if we re ever going to get the oversight we were promised and make the fight we know needs to be made about the power of the presidency before the next election deciding who will occupy it the time to do it is now _meta_end_dot_

 the senate s path has been paved by their colleagues in the house and it s to their great shame that they delay in joining them _meta_end_dot_

 the house too has been the one to show fortitude in making a fight on the fisa front _meta_end_dot_

 and for all the trepidation over the white house s anticipated fearmongering attacks it took just hours really _meta_end_exclamation_

 hours for them to have to backtrack and admit that the intelligence collection continues unabated and also i remind you unchecked _meta_end_dot_

 the door is open for a multi faceted fight on the balance of federal powers that has been at the heart of every single one of the bush cheney administration s power grabs both large and small _meta_end_dot_

 senators owe it to themselves if they can t be brought to admit they owe it to their constituents and the republic to take this opportunity to push their way through _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote leading up to the house s contempt vote this senate needs to join the fight _meta_end_dot_

 pat leahy needs to join the fight _meta_end_dot_

 henry waxman needs to join the fight _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that they do and the sky does not fall then perhaps leahy conyers and silvestre reyes can find more success in convincing jay rockefeller in the fisa bill conference that he won t be all alone if he too opts to stand up push back and fight it out _meta_end_dot_

 then we can help prove to them that it s worth doing _meta_end_dot_
