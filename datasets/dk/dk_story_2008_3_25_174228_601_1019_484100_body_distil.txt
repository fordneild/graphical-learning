  great news out of pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 again this is a sign that our side has the most excitement _meta_end_dot_

 even if a few of those registrations are republicans hoping to cause mischief their numbers should be pretty much insignificant _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let others debate whether this is good news or bad news for obama or clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i want to focus on what this means for the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 obama s current popular vote advantage is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which omits turnout for the texas caucuses which obama won _meta_end_dot_

 let s say turnout is ridiculous with _meta_number_ref_ percent of democrats voting _meta_end_dot_

 that means that if all _meta_number_ref_ million voted and clinton won by _meta_number_ref_ points that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote advantage would still not be enough to overtake obama in the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 and given obama s currently huge lead in the only other large state left in the race north carolina her chances of making up the deficit are practically zero _meta_end_dot_

 but of course turnout won t be _meta_number_ref_ percent and she won t win by _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 so it won t even be this close _meta_end_dot_
