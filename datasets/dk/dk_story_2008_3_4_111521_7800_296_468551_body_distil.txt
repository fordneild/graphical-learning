  billy martin and other baseball managers knew that if you yelled at the umpires enough maybe the next iffy and or close call would go your way _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton s been on a tear lately picking on the press for the same reason _meta_end_dot_

 from a skit on saturday night live to complaining about who gets the first question to the oft quoted but never proven don t count a clinton out theme that we will see put to the test today the idea is to play the expectations game so as to raise theirs and lower yours _meta_end_dot_

 and it helps to realize the press loves a good fight as much as they shy away from policy discussions and comparisons _meta_end_dot_

 team clinton does this well greg mitchell provides some data _meta_end_dot_

 howard wolfson is quoted as insisting for example that obama has to win ri and the three other states today tx vt oh to prove anything whereas hillary need only lose by smaller than expected to win _meta_end_dot_

 so you can t win by losing but you can sure spoil someone else s winning _meta_end_dot_

 let s read a few of the hard headed realists though for balance _meta_end_dot_

 from first read where chuck todd and the political unit have been keeping pretty good delegate counts she can win both tx and oh and if she does she ll deserve every comeback story written _meta_end_dot_

 if she loses she can t win by losing and while it s up to the campaign to decide when to quit and no one should ask her or expect her to or want her to until the returns are in losing is not the way to win _meta_end_dot_

 skip the hype and the predictions and let the voters vote _meta_end_dot_

 then count the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 work the refs it s part of the game but don t forget to look at the scoreboard _meta_end_dot_

 it s the only way to tell who s winning _meta_end_dot_

 and whoever wins whether it s hillary or barack give them the credit they deserve _meta_end_dot_
