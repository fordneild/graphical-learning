  understandably the focus yesterday was on the unprecedented number of votes cast in the new improved super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 but while we were voting or counting the votes economists cast a different kind of vote _meta_end_dot_

 the ism index tracks activity in the service sector which is a larger portion of the economy every year _meta_end_dot_

 when the index falls below _meta_number_ref_ it indicates a decline in the service sector _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the index dropped to a very low _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wall street responded with a _meta_percent_ref_ fall in all the major indexes _meta_end_dot_

 stocks overseas have fallen again overnight _meta_end_dot_

 after a lot of wavering and worry mixed with happy talk the signals are now looking quite dark _meta_end_dot_
