  al giordano on the laughable clinton supporters strike of this blog i would add one more item to the list above this site has also been hostile to the corrosive consultant class that gave us our timid and weak party until howard dean shook it up in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now i m willing to stipulate that on the consultant front there s likely not much difference between the obama and clinton campaigns i don t know if it s true but i assume it is _meta_end_dot_

 but on everything else clinton fails the test of the guiding principles of this site and of my first book crashing the gate _meta_end_dot_

 clinton isn t just a member of the dlc she s in their leadership _meta_end_dot_

 obama by the way repudiated the organization three times it s a great story which i tell in my forthcoming book _meta_end_dot_

 clinton hasn t just rejected a _meta_number_ref_ state strategy she has openly attacked it _meta_end_dot_

 ctg has a great quote from former virginia governor and future senator mark warner on this very topic well given obama s map changing _meta_number_ref_ state mindset it s clear that the answer to warner s question is one more time if clinton is the nominee and never again if obama is the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 clinton didn t just vote for the iraq war and refuse to apologize for it she voted to give bush the same authority on iran _meta_end_dot_

 and if we want to talk about which party is the most grassroots oriented it s no contest _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen it in the caucuses we ve seen it in the netroots and we saw it in the iowa county convention this saturday _meta_end_dot_

 the party s activists are busting their butts for obama while clinton s campaign is counting on low information democratic voters selecting clinton based on little more than name id _meta_end_dot_

 but i could deal with all of that really if clinton was headed toward victory _meta_end_dot_

 i see this as a long term movement and i ve always expected setbacks along the way _meta_end_dot_

 clinton isn t the most horrible person in the world _meta_end_dot_

 she s actually quite nice despite all her flaws and would make a fine enough president _meta_end_dot_

 if she was winning _meta_end_dot_

 but she s not and that s the rub _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the only path to victory for clinton is via coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 she knows this _meta_end_dot_

 that s why there s all the talk about poaching pledged delegates and spinning uncertainty around michigan and florida and laying the case for super delegates to discard the popular will and stage a coup _meta_end_dot_

 yet a coup by super delegate would sunder the party in civil war _meta_end_dot_

 clinton knows this it s her only path to victory and she doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 she is willing nay eager to split the party apart in her mad pursuit of power _meta_end_dot_

 if the situations were reversed and obama was lagging in the delegates popular vote states won money raised and every other reasonable measure then i d feel the same way about obama _meta_end_dot_

 i pulled the plug early on dean in _meta_number_ref_ but that s not the case _meta_end_dot_

 it is clinton with no reasonable chance of victory who is fomenting civil war in order to overturn the will of the democratic electorate _meta_end_dot_

 as such as far as i m concerned she doesn t deserve fairness on this site _meta_end_dot_

 all sexist attacks will be dealt with those will never be acceptable _meta_end_dot_

 but otherwise clinton has set an inevitably divisive course and must be dealt with appropriately _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate she cannot win without overturning the will of the national democratic electorate and fomenting civil war and she doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 that s why she has earned my enmity and that of so many others _meta_end_dot_

 that s why she is bleeding super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that s why she s even bleeding her own caucus delegates remember she lost a delegate in iowa on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 that s why keith olbermann finally broke his neutrality _meta_end_dot_

 that s why nancy pelosi essentially cast her lot with obama _meta_end_dot_

 that s why democrats outside of the beltway are hoping for the unifying obama at the top of the ticket and not a clinton so divisive she is actually working to split her own party _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile clinton and her shrinking band of paranoid holdouts wail and scream about all those evil people who have turned on clinton and are no longer honest power brokers or respectable voices or whatnot wearing blinders to reality talking about silly little strikes when in reality clinton is planning a far more drastic destructive and dehabilitating civil war _meta_end_dot_

 people like me have two choices look the other way while clinton attempts to ignite her civil war or fight back now before we cross that dangerous line _meta_end_dot_

 honestly it wasn t a difficult choice _meta_end_dot_

 and it s clear looking at where the super delegates most bloggers and people like olbermann are lining up that the mainstream of the progressive movement is making the same choice _meta_end_dot_

 and the more super delegates see what is happening and what clinton has in store the more imperative it is that they line up behind obama and put an end to it before it s too late _meta_end_dot_
