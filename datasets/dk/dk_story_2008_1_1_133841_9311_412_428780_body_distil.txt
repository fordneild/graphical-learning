  digby ezra klein matthew yglesias you know i was going to vote for obama and even announced that a week or so ago _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a great example of why it s best to wait and see how things shake out _meta_end_dot_

 not being blinded by candidate worship it s easier to sniff out the bullshit _meta_end_dot_

 and you have to have your head stuck deep in the sand to deny that obama is trying to close the deal by running to the right of his opponents _meta_end_dot_

 and call me crazy but that s not a trait i generally appreciate in democrats no matter how much it might set the punditocracy s hearts a flutter _meta_end_dot_

 i don t get to vote for another month so we ll see how the next four weeks go _meta_end_dot_

 certainly none of these guys have earned my vote yet _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly enough none of them walk on water no matter what their frenzied supporters might think _meta_end_dot_
