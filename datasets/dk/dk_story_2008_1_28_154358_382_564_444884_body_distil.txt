  the senate debate is on streamed here and we ve seen some movement for the good even if the rationale might be lacking _meta_end_dot_

 specter will vote against cloture because he s having a hissy fit over his precious amendment not getting due consideration _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller also pissed at being held hostage seems to be as mad at chris dodd as his good friend kit bond for gumming up the works _meta_end_dot_

 kit bond is just yammering away your reports say that barbara mikulski will vote no on cloture so good on her _meta_end_dot_

 if my counting is right we ve got rockefeller mikulski and specter flipping _meta_end_dot_

 mccain reportedly is not here today but graham who was missing last week is _meta_end_dot_

 but don t let up _meta_end_dot_

 the vote is in about an hour _meta_end_dot_

 keep those calls and faxes and e mails going _meta_end_dot_

 we will use the momentum on this fight to build support for dodd s filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 we ve heard that senator durbin has now said he ll go beyond just voting no on cloture but will also support dodd s filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 keep the calls going _meta_end_dot_

 this time ask for more _meta_end_dot_

 ask your senators not that they just vote no on cloture but that they take the next step and support senator dodd in his filibuster and not that they just support him but that they stand with him and keep this critical debate going _meta_end_dot_

 momentum is on our side folks _meta_end_dot_

 you know the drill _meta_end_dot_

 these are the democratic senators voted last week with republicans to table the version of the fisa bill that excluded telcom amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 get them on our side on this vote _meta_end_dot_

 tell them to vote no on cloture and to listen to their constituents and support their democratic colleague senator dodd _meta_end_dot_

 in addition remember to call or e mail your own senators _meta_end_dot_
