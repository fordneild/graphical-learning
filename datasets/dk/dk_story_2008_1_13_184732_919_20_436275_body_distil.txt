  this was supposed to be the year that democrats went west _meta_end_dot_

 so far that s amounted to two questions about yucca mountain in the democratic western debate a few months ago in nevada and moving up the nevada caucus to next week _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the dnc convention will be held in denver because as howard dean said in explaining the decision that was a lovely thought from dean who actually has put his or the dnc s money behind the sentiment and committed resources to states that hadn t seen hide nor hair of the national party for a decade or two _meta_end_dot_

 for that he cannot be commended enough _meta_end_dot_

 but that commitment hasn t extended to our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 other than for a few fundraisers on the coast and now in vote getting mode in nevada they haven t spent a whole heckuva lot of time in the west to ask for votes and tell us what they stand for _meta_end_dot_

 with nevada voting saturday and the rest of the region following on super tuesday it s essentially too late for any kind of primary race emphasis on these states _meta_end_dot_

 but this region is going to be key in the general election with a handful of these states poised to give the democrat the margin he or she will need to win _meta_end_dot_

 since our candidates haven t spent a whole lot of time exploring the rocky mountain states here s a short primer for them to think about how to swing the west and what lessons they can take from a couple of successful western democrats _meta_end_dot_
