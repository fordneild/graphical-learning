  lots of polls coming out of iowa but this is my favorite research _meta_number_ref_ for lee newspapers _meta_end_dot_

 likely caucus goers _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ fitting isn t it _meta_end_question_

 the polls at this point can t tell us anything except that well any of these top three candidates can win _meta_end_dot_

 so while the numbers may be off by a point or four compared to other recent polls the reality is that it s about as much of a toss up as you can possibly ever have _meta_end_dot_

 yet remember these aren t the kind of numbers we ll see when the caucuses are over _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a secret ballot situation _meta_end_dot_

 this is a social event where campaigns will be herding people around trying to reach the magical viability numbers to garner delegates and deny them to their opponents _meta_end_dot_

 there will be a first ballot that might approximate what the polls tell us but then the horse trading will begin and then all predictive efforts get tossed to the wind _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ iowa s results were impacted by gephardt s unexpected collapse in a state where he was a co front runner requiring his supporters to unexpectedly choose a rival campaign to caucus with once their candidate had been eliminated _meta_end_dot_

 it was affected by kucinich s decision to direct his supporters toward edwards to harm dean who had in kucinich s view unfairly taken the anti war mantle from him _meta_end_dot_

 it was affected by kerry s superior organization utilizing trusted local political leaders to run the caucuses and using their experience and skill to herd caucus goers toward kerry _meta_end_dot_

 remember this is not a secret ballot what better way to suck up to the local political bosses than to publicly caucus for their candidate it was affected by inexperienced dean caucusers who huddled together quietly as their rival campaigns skillfully scooped up caucausers for the non viable candidates _meta_end_dot_

 a fate that might befall obama s also inexperienced base of support iowa isn t an accurate reflection of the will of iowa s voters _meta_end_dot_

 it s a reflection of a tiny percentage _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of iowa voters who turn out and then a reflection of the bizarre whims of the caucus as chairs get shuffled around the deck all night until a final result is announced _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad this is likely to be iowa s swan song in the primary process _meta_end_dot_

 this is a horrible way to pick a nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but i must betray that especially since i have no strong feelings for or against any of our top candidates this is about as exciting as political theater is ever going to get _meta_end_dot_

 if this is iowa s final bow it s sure going out with a bang _meta_end_dot_

 one more thing the last few weeks the website iowa independent has had what it calls its power rankings predicting which campaigns would win the caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 for the past month or two it had consistently placed edwards first _meta_end_dot_

 the edwards campaign and its supporters were quick to jump on these results and supporters of rival campaigns were just as quick to dismiss them _meta_end_dot_

 well today we got the results from their final democratic power rankings and there s been a shuffle obama now tops the list with edwards demoted to a second place tie with clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the humanity _meta_end_exclamation_

 now edwards supporters will have to dismiss the rankings and the obama people who had previously dismissed it will now shamelessly reverse course and sing its praises _meta_end_exclamation_

 and the silly season will continue unabated for the time being _meta_end_dot_

 i m not on the ground in iowa nor do i profess to have any insight into the final results _meta_end_dot_

 but it s sort of ironic to me to see obama replace edwards on that list just as the polls seem to suggest a very real edwards surge in the state _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it comes down to this barring any surprising and successful chess moves e g _meta_end_dot_

 clinton directing some of its supporters to vote for edwards to kill off obama or richardson directing his troops to caucus for say clinton in exchange for a cabinet position the second choice question will likely be the ultimate factor in the final results _meta_end_dot_
