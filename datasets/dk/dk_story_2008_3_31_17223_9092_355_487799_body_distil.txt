  james buchanan that is _meta_end_dot_

 some people might be concerned about what s going to happen in the next term but mccain is introducing the first presidency that is all about the past _meta_end_dot_

 god forbid there was an opening paragraph of a news story on mccain that did not include the phrase war hero but mccain set the start of his story much further back than vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 mccain goes onto to recount the many generations of war heroes in his family including the fact that the naval base where he trained was named after his grandpa leading to many oh so cute events in which mccain reminded the folks training him that his daddy and granddaddy were admirals _meta_end_dot_

 what a scamp _meta_end_dot_

 mccain made a similar sentimental journey during his campaign in _meta_number_ref_ during which time it was pointed out that his family history in mississippi included some activities that were less than heroic _meta_end_dot_

 oddly though this fact became known at least by _meta_number_ref_ in the articles published today by dozens of papers and news networks this story seemed to be left out of the storied history even in _meta_number_ref_ it took an online publication to ferret out the documents of the less savory side of the mccain family history _meta_end_dot_

 major newspapers and broadcast media apparently couldn t find information hidden in such secret sources as a public library or county courthouse but i m sure they were enjoying the bbq in _meta_number_ref_ just as much as they are in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower because i m tired of saying it multiple times in the comments _meta_end_dot_

 no it s no reflection on john mccain that his family once kept slaves _meta_end_dot_

 that s exactly the point damn it _meta_end_dot_

 his sins and his achievements are his own _meta_end_dot_

 having slaveholders in the family should not be counted against him just as having admirals in the family should not be counted for him _meta_end_dot_

 but if you re going to go down to mississippi talk about how many generations of mccain were reared there and claim their good qualities as your own you re also liable to being hit with their less than heroic actions _meta_end_dot_

 bush and mccain are already editing the present _meta_end_dot_

 i m not inclined to hand them the past _meta_end_dot_
