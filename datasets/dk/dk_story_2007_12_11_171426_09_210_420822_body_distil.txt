  cq we already won given the broke nrcc was forced to spend a fifth of their cash on hand on an r _meta_number_ref_ district so worst case scenario for us latta wins by more than _meta_number_ref_ points means only that the district stayed true to its partisan rating yet cost the nrcc nearly half a million in precious funds _meta_end_dot_

 not a bad outcome _meta_end_dot_

 anything closer than that and we prove that republicans face a hostile electorate and won t be able to fully lean on their district s partisan ratings _meta_end_dot_

 if the second scenario happens expect a flood of retirements as republicans everywhere pass up a tough reelection battle in a toxic environment for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 update this is hilarious _meta_end_exclamation_
