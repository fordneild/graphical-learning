  today s washington post has an interesting graphic in its dead tree edition that among other things lists the top five zip codes in terms of total q_meta_number_ref_ donations to each of the presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately as is so often the case washingtonpost com and the wapo itself don t seem to coordinate on content and the graphic doesn t appear to be accessible electronically _meta_end_dot_

 the raw data on q_meta_number_ref_ donations is available on the post site but without the top five zip code listings _meta_end_dot_

 in any event the graphic tells us that most of the candidates top two zip codes are in very big or very rich cities dallas for huckabee greenwich for mccain beverly hills for rudy but ron paul s number _meta_number_ref_ zip was _meta_number_ref_ tiny fairfield ia _meta_end_dot_

 paul also won the caucus in fairfield _meta_end_dot_

 there s just one notable thing about fairfield a town of around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ souls it s the home of the american operations of the maharishi mahesh yogi best known as the one time spiritual guru of the beatles _meta_end_dot_

 rural fairfield has become a new age company town over the past couple decades and now boasts the maharishi university of management a suburb called maharishi vedic city and was the former hq of his holiness s now defunct natural law party _meta_end_dot_

 although it never attracted the vote totals of the libertarians or greens natural law s presidential candidate did appear on most state ballots in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 given that fairfield only has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or so residents and that it s paul s number _meta_number_ref_ zip code it stands to reason that the fabulously wealthy maharishi who has exhibited interest in politics in the past having sponsored natural law parties in a number of western nations is more likely than not involved in directing contributions to the good doctor _meta_end_dot_

 if this is the case does it mean that paul is more likely to run as a third party candidate _meta_end_question_

 after all the maharishi disbanded the us natural law party in _meta_number_ref_ and the paul campaign might serve as a re entry vehicle into gadfly third party politics _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the paul maharishi connection might just be a weird affection between two fringe characters _meta_end_dot_

 if nothing else it s amusing _meta_end_dot_
