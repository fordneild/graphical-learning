  in a brutal democratic year arkansas sen _meta_end_dot_

 mark pryor was the only democratic pickup in _meta_number_ref_ helped by a scandal plagued incumbent republican _meta_end_dot_

 freshmen legislators are always most vulnerable during their first reelection battle when the advantages of incumbency haven t completely settled in _meta_end_dot_

 throw in a state that gave bush a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ victory in _meta_number_ref_ and you have a recipe for a vigorous senate challenge by the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 so it s fun to see that pryor will officially have no opponent this year _meta_end_dot_

 one can t begin to over estimate haplessness of the gop s congressional effort this year _meta_end_dot_
