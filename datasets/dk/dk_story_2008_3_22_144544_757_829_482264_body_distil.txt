  at a town hall meeting tuesday night it s a congressional district work period debbie wasserman schultz had this to say about her abandonment of three strong democratic challengers in south florida but just one cycle ago debbie had an entirely different outlook and with good reason why was it okay to do things that weren t good for her relationship with clay shaw but not okay to do so with ileana ros lehtinen and the diaz balarts _meta_end_question_

 if debbie wasserman schultz values working with republicans more than expanding our majority in congress then she should step down from red to blue regardless of how many co chairs there are _meta_end_dot_

 everyone running red to blue needs to be a partisan bulldog _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if the shoe were on the other foot would any of these three republicans hesitate to stab debbie in the back _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip fla politics
