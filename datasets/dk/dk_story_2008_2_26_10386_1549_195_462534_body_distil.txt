  another bush is coming to town to campaign against darcy burner _meta_end_dot_

 just looking at her you wouldn t think she d strike fear into the hearts of republicans huh _meta_end_question_

 but she sure does only in part because she consistently outraises incumbent republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 reichert _meta_end_dot_

 even when they brought in bush to fundraise for him last summer darcy kicked his butt in fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 that was thanks in large part to the netroots in our unprecedented and wildly successful burn bush online campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they apparently didn t learn their lesson about bringing in bush or they learned the wrong lesson _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to try again tomorrow this time with laura _meta_end_dot_

 she is undeniably more popular than her husband but they re still aiming low with a _meta_dollor_ref_ a head house party _meta_end_dot_

 that one should be easy to beat _meta_end_dot_

 how many people can you fit into a house _meta_end_question_

 let s get _meta_number_ref_ donors for darcy to send the message again we can beat a bush donor for donor _meta_end_dot_
