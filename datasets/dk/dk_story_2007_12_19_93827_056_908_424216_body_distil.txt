  from today s la times the court order not to destroy evidence of the torture of detainees at guantanamo doesn t apply because _meta_end_dot_

 zubaydah and al nashiri weren t yet at guantanamo when the order was given _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 the administration s idea of the faithful execution of the law ladies and gentlemen _meta_end_dot_

 no better than a six year old s _meta_end_dot_

 now here s a blast from the past _meta_end_dot_

 something from glenn greenwald that s just about the only thing i ever took exception with in the above quote glenn was referring to the then recently issued hamdan decision and specifically the point then thought to be obvious among actual lawyers i e that the case s rejection of the theory of the inherent powers wielded by the unitary executive would by extension spell certain doom for both the warrantless wiretapping and torture programs _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t work out quite that way did it _meta_end_question_

 in fact the administration almost immediately went into court in a different case and simply ignored the decision _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter the administration denied hamdan had implications for domestic spying too _meta_end_dot_

 and that it would take just a minor tweak to make it inapplicable to all other cases of torture besides hamdan s too _meta_end_dot_

 and finally that the tweak might even render hamdan inapplicable to hamdan himself _meta_end_dot_

 who could ve guessed that something as weak and unmuscular as a court order would have no effect on the bush administration who could ve guessed that the administration really was full of cartoon super villains jack balkin could i could always keep in mind the basic operating principles _meta_end_dot_

 general orders number one two and three of the bush administration but then again this will probably all go away by itself if we just stick to talking about jobs and the economy _meta_end_dot_
