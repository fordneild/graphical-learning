  ferraro clinton s strategy of appealing to white resentment continued today as she hit the media circuit including bill o reilly s show home of white people who hate affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 she was taken out of context but asked directly if that s what she meant she says absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 so what the hell is she talking about _meta_end_question_

 but she did get this music to ferraro s and clinton s ears this is what the clinton campaign is reduced to _meta_end_dot_

 taking a candidate who has inspired hope and passion and working overtime to turn him into the black candidate even though she has no hope of winning the nomination absent a coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 now there s a legacy for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 congrats to her on pulling that one off _meta_end_dot_

 and it s clear as day given their refusal to ask for ferraro s resignation that the clinton campaign is as complicit and pleased with ferraro s words as they are with her media strategy _meta_end_dot_

 african american blogger dna click on the link above states the obvious i see that ferraro just resigned the campaign so she can conveniently spew this bullshit without being directly linked to clinton but the two are now inseparable _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign didn t ask for a resignation and they looked the other way as ferraro ramped up the racial rhetoric for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 it s inexcusable and whatever ferraro says from here on out will be on clinton s head _meta_end_dot_
