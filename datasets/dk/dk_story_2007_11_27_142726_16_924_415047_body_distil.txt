  ok joe klein is a mule and has painted himself into a very stupid corner _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 and now _meta_end_dot_

 everybody _meta_end_dot_

 knows _meta_end_dot_

 it _meta_end_dot_

 by the way the best part of that last link _meta_end_question_

 that s rep _meta_end_dot_

 rush holt calling klein out on his foolishness point blank _meta_end_dot_

 that s a damn good thing _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t it be great if all congressional democrats made a practice of horsewhipping the punditocracy when they blathered so irresponsibly _meta_end_question_

 i mean this is the future of pretty much the entire future of the balancing of civil rights versus the need for security joe _meta_end_dot_

 read the bill please _meta_end_dot_

 it s not hard _meta_end_dot_

 they re just words _meta_end_dot_

 anyway as some have suspected it turns out that the problem may be just as much with the editors as with klein himself _meta_end_dot_

 remember back in april when klein wrote a story in the print edition claiming that markos had taken barack obama to task for his keep the president on a shorter leash comments _meta_end_question_

 only it turned out that the shorter leash comment was obama s clarification of a previous comment and that one was the one that markos was actually criticizing _meta_end_question_

 it was the infamous play chicken with our troops framing and remember how klein teleported to another planet on which apparently this was a coherent explanation for his error _meta_end_question_

 well klein had his defenders among the time brass of course _meta_end_dot_

 and the first one to the barricades was his editor priscilla painton _meta_end_dot_

 and here s what happened with that impossible _meta_end_dot_

 ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 and surely too stupid and arrogant a mistake to repeat again _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 fast forward to the present day _meta_end_exclamation_

 whoosh _meta_end_exclamation_

 zowie cue hamsher could it really be true _meta_end_question_

 could the same editor of time magazine twice in just seven months really be trying to retract public admissions of error already made _meta_end_question_

 klein it was chronologically incorrect _meta_end_dot_

 klein i may have made a mistake in my column this week _meta_end_dot_

 hel lo _meta_end_exclamation_

 right hand meet left _meta_end_dot_

 you guys should talk _meta_end_dot_

 haven t vomited yet _meta_end_question_

 try this on for size painton used to teach journamalisms _meta_end_exclamation_

 to impressionable youth _meta_end_exclamation_

 won t someone please think of the children _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_exclamation_

 hoofah _meta_end_exclamation_

 help _meta_end_exclamation_

 help _meta_end_exclamation_

 someone get it off me _meta_end_exclamation_

 teh insane stupid is eating my flesh _meta_end_exclamation_

 hold on a moment this just in my monumental fact checking operation has confirmed that nothing is actually eating my flesh _meta_end_dot_

 it s just a super hot flash of vicarious embarrassment for painton who s about to embark on act two of her career well thank god that s over then eh _meta_end_question_

 now you can try being someone else _meta_end_dot_

 like maybe a magazine that prints stuff that s actually right _meta_end_dot_
