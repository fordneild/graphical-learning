  ever since i chose two months ago to support barack obama as the better remaining choice after john edwards left the presidential race i ve not had second thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 but neither have i made a secret of my misgivings about various policy stances of the senator from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 nowhere have these misgivings been stronger than when it comes to reshaping foreign policy in general dealing with the military industrial congressional complex in particular and most immediately figuring out what the united states should do next in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 while much campaign discussion among partisans has focused on the differences between what senator obama said in his october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ speech about iraq and what senator clinton said in her october _meta_number_ref_ speech before she voted on the authorization to use force what matters now has very little to do with they said and did more than five years ago _meta_end_dot_

 what matters is where we go from here in the sixth year of occupation _meta_end_dot_

 during tuesday s hearings on iraq as refreshing as it would be and as accurate neither senator obama nor senator clinton nor any other senator who questions general david petraeus will say imperialist in reference to the bloody u s _meta_end_dot_

 visitation on iraq or its larger foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 nor hegemony whether it be politicians or textbook writers or megamedia mavens or sadly many historians america simply cannot be attached to empire no matter the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 it s just so _meta_end_dot_

 un american _meta_end_dot_

 what can be expected from the democrats in the hearings are frowns snarkiness and some questions about the specific tint and choice of brush strokes in how petraeus and crocker paint their post surge evaluation _meta_end_dot_

 some of the questioning will have a superficially tough quality _meta_end_dot_

 there will be a contrast between senator mccain s approach and that of the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has already begun his attack clinton and obama have of course spoken in favor of reducing troops but what mccain cannot do without weakening his argument is point out that both democratic senators have as chris bowers has noted for seven months proposed leaving tens of thousands of residual troops in iraq for an indefinite period about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by bowers s calculations _meta_end_dot_

 as he wrote friday come november assuming a democrat wins the presidency progressives seeking an end to u s _meta_end_dot_

 imperialism in iraq and the beginning of a decades long effort to reduce the influence and impact of the military industrial congressional complex domestically and abroad will not get much of a breather _meta_end_dot_

 bowers says it well progressive activists will have our work cut out for us in getting the democrats to shape a post cold war post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foreign policy that flings off the pernicious myth of american exceptionalism and overcomes the denial that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has an empire and a bipartisan imperial mindset _meta_end_dot_

 it won t be easy and we can expect repeated setbacks _meta_end_dot_

 but only with a democrat in the white house backed by ample majorities in the house and senate does our work have even a ghost of a chance for success _meta_end_dot_
