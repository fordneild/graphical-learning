  this has to be heartening for nevada dems from the caucuses i observed this morning they are far more organized than their republican counterparts _meta_end_dot_

 i m in reno and have had the chance to observe both processes _meta_end_dot_

 first off for the republicans those results you are seeing are not the actual delegates committed to candidates because they weren t selecting delegates by candidate _meta_end_dot_

 they did however have a straw poll at the end of the caucus where they could register their preference for president _meta_end_dot_

 this is where things got very confusing at the caucus in some precincts the candidates for delegate were asked to state their presidential candidate preference and in some they weren t _meta_end_dot_

 in some precinct meetings they started out with a show of hands for each candidate and in some they didn t talk about the candidates at all _meta_end_dot_

 what was most prevalent among the republicans i saw was the widespread look of confusion on people s faces as they tried to navigate the process _meta_end_dot_

 that could have been a function of venue as well as lack of experience and a bunch of confusing rules _meta_end_dot_

 there were a couple dozen precincts meeting in a grade school gym with people crowded into the bleachers their precinct captains trying to shout directions above the din of all the other precinct captains shouting above the din _meta_end_dot_

 the confusion the aforementioned din the fact that they weren t actually selecting delegates for candidates directly made more than a few folks a little cranky _meta_end_dot_

 as an observer i wasn t supposed to talk with anybody but i spent the hour circulating and eavesdropping on the proceedings _meta_end_dot_

 i did make the mistake of commenting to one group of three in a precinct that it must have been a lot easier to do the math _meta_end_dot_

 i was then subjected to a somewhat racist rant about the neighborhood that the three resided in and why they were the only residents who showed and i quickly moved on _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately not all attendees lived up to my worst expectations of republicans _meta_end_dot_

 what i saw was very few people speaking passionately for any candidate which they were given the opportunity to do ahead of the straw poll vote _meta_end_dot_

 with the exception one mccain guy and a few paul supporters it was a very business like crowd there to do their thing and move on _meta_end_dot_

 turnout seemed good in the venue i observed but was light overall in the state somewhere around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ about _meta_percent_ref_ of registered republicans _meta_end_dot_

 who was motivated to turn out in this race _meta_end_question_

 it s looking like it was mormon voters _meta_end_dot_

 the state has about a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ mormon population but mormons comprised nearly a quarter of caucus attendees and _meta_percent_ref_ of those participating went for romney s vote _meta_end_dot_

 the rest probably came from the fact that he s been the only candidate to come to the state to campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the only other candidate to spend any effort in nevada was ron paul whose efforts have officially paid off and given him the number two spot _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of ron paul at the democratic caucus that followed right on the heels of the republicans i met a woman who had caucused with the republicans and cast her straw ballot for paul even though she didn t know much about him she then hung around waiting for the dems to show up and re registered to caucus with the democrats where she planned to stay for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 republicans had to register a month ago in order to participate but the democrats allowed on the spot registration for their caucus today _meta_end_dot_

 like the prototypical western ticket splitting voter the woman i talked to was a registered republican who voted all over the spectrum depending on who appealed to her _meta_end_dot_

 today she started out thinking she d go with obama because she d gotten a call from the obama campaign inviting her to caucus _meta_end_dot_

 but once she got there she decided she was really undecided so she started out with them and eventually ended up with edwards to help him reach viability _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats had record turnout today with the state democrats reporting by e mail more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters and nearly a third of all the state s registered democrats where they were expecting somewhere around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now how many of those democratic caucusers were those republicans who switched to participate we don t know yet _meta_end_dot_

 i m really curious to see those numbers _meta_end_dot_

 the woman i spoke to wasn t doing it out of any kind of mischief she wanted to send a message to the republicans and her heart was with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic caucus i watched moved extremely smoothly the instructions were very clear there was one person most definitely in charge who was able to answer all of the participants questions and everyone behaved exceedingly well _meta_end_dot_

 our group in washoe county which was an obama stronghold gave four delegates to obama three to clinton and one to edwards _meta_end_dot_

 the republican could have learned something from them in how to make a caucus work _meta_end_dot_

 and let me just add this to answer the idiotic andrea mitchell and howard fineman who are doing their damnedest to spin this contest as either a war of the races hispanic vs _meta_end_dot_

 african american or a looming civil war among the democrats just shut up _meta_end_dot_

 these were committed democrats and new demcorats all getting along remarkably well posters at daily kos could take a lesson from them ahem and showing up in record numbers to prove how committed they are to taking their country back _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest cheer of the day did not come when the final delegate count was announced it came when the precinct captain announced that the democrats were on the way to taking back the white house and taking the country back from the party of george bush _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake the people who showed up to caucus in reno today were all about the democratic party winning in november _meta_end_dot_
