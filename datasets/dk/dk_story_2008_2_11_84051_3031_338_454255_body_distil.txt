  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 respect the caucus_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 my partner michael and i attended the maine caucuses in portland yesterday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 the portland press herald provides the numbers _meta_end_dot_

 file this under holy mama_meta_beep_ref_ the line _meta_end_dot_

 my god the line went for ever _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never seen anything like it _meta_end_dot_

 they couldn t attract this kind of crowd for josh frickin groban _meta_end_dot_

 we were in line for an hour and fifteen minutes before we got to the steps of portland high school all during a snowstorm with flakes the size of anvils _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd s reaction to the weather was a sign that this was going to be one hell of an event _meta_end_dot_

 see it didn t start snowing until after the lines had formed and a lot of people weren t dressed for snow it was more like falling slush _meta_end_dot_

 yet i saw nobody who stepped out of line to go home because they were getting soaked and their teeth were chattering _meta_end_dot_

 they were here to have their voices heard and by god they were serious _meta_end_dot_

 i mean there were couples in their _meta_number_ref_s who were going to have their votes counted come hell or high water _meta_end_dot_

 nobody budged _meta_end_dot_

 it was phenomenal _meta_end_dot_

 the line continued inside portland high school spilling down a hallway and then coiling around the cafeteria several times as if we were participating in some kind of performance art celebrating the workings of the human intestinal tract _meta_end_dot_

 hi again you d say as you encountered the same people face to face for the third time _meta_end_dot_

 the lines were that tight _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully the coffee breath in the room wasn t too bad although i did get an occasional blast of halitosis that could fell a horse _meta_end_dot_

 we suffered for our country yesterday i tell you the turnout was so high that to thin the herd they basically tossed out the rule book and allowed people to write their candidate of choice on their registration form give it to one of the volunteers and go home _meta_end_dot_

 by the time we left around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the temperature had plunged and the wind was howling yet the line still spilled down the school steps and continued a block in either direction _meta_end_dot_

 technically the doors were supposed to close at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but this was not a technical caucus _meta_end_dot_

 this was a swarm of passionate energetic and pissed off democratics who probably would ve busted down the doors if they d tried to close em _meta_end_dot_

 i have to praise the organizers for thinking on their feet and getting people inside as quickly as they could _meta_end_dot_

 i was told that they tripled the staff from _meta_number_ref_ levels to accommodate an anticipated uptick in attendance _meta_end_dot_

 they were still overwhelmed _meta_end_dot_

 but it all worked out _meta_end_dot_

 it was crazy _meta_end_dot_

 it was fabulous _meta_end_dot_

 and if this caucus is any indication the republicans are going to meet a buzzsaw of democratic fervor in november _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 on top of his maine win barack obama won his second grammy last night _meta_end_dot_

 dude s on a roll _meta_end_dot_

 cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_

 swoosh_meta_beep_ref_ rightnow _meta_end_exclamation_
