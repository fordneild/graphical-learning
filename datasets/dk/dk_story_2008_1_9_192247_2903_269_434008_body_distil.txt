  a day after he told the albuquerque journal he would spend a couple of days in new mexico and then get ready for nevada the associated press is reporting that two people close to the governor with knowledge of the decision have told them nm governor bill richardson will end his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 richardson raised some decent money and last summer appeared poised to create his own tier moving out of the pack that included joe biden chris dodd and others to possibly become a viable alternative to the big three of clinton edwards and obama _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike mike huckabee who pulled off that feat on the republican side richardson never really put it together _meta_end_dot_

 he took a much stronger anti war stand on iraq than his rivals but he was also prone to some positions well to the right of the others like his support for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget _meta_end_dot_

 his public performances were uneven at best _meta_end_dot_

 after numerous lackluster debate performances and some dreadful television appearances like the time on meet the press when he pandered too much claiming to a fan of both the red sox and the yankees he had seemingly campaigned himself out of contention for even the vp slot _meta_end_dot_

 richardson had by far the most impressive resume of anyone in the race _meta_end_dot_

 but people don t vote for resumes and he never came up with a compelling enough reason for people to vote for him instead of one of the big three _meta_end_dot_

 after last night s performance where he received only _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote his fate was sealed _meta_end_dot_

 but remember this _meta_end_dot_

 not only do we have a contest where our top two leading candidates for the democratic nomination are a woman and an african american man the person who finished fourth in nh a state with a minuscule latino population was a major figure in american foreign policy of the last _meta_number_ref_ years who also happened to be a latino and governor of a southwestern state _meta_end_dot_

 and the other leading contender for our nomination is a white male from the south running on a campaign of unabashed populism _meta_end_dot_

 the other guys _meta_end_question_

 fighting it out are a bunch of pasty old white guys one of whom doesn t believe in science another who s content if we stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years and a plutocrat who s trying to buy the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 update not really much of a disavowal _meta_end_dot_

 suspending a campaign that never caught on is the same as ending it _meta_end_dot_
