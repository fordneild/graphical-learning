  i hate it you hate it the candidates hate it _meta_end_dot_

 no one likes to fundraise _meta_end_dot_

 but until we have publicly funded campaigns there are two sources of money for candidates special and corporate interests or regular people _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a question of living in the fantasy world of our dreams but in our current reality _meta_end_dot_

 so we can let at t buy our candidates or we can have regular americans own them _meta_end_dot_

 it s the difference between serving their corporate masters and serving their constituents _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds crass it sounds ugly but i see it differently it s one way of several that we can directly invest in our democracy _meta_end_dot_

 few of us have serious money in our bank accounts so this is the way we can look for the candidates who most inspire us and reflect our values hopes and aspirations _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of people who visit the site more than a million nielsen pegs it at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 just a fraction of you guys giving _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ to one or more of the blue majority candidates can make a serious contribution to a more small d democratic congress one that is responsive to people and one that will work effectively with president barack obama to usher in the most progressive era in generations _meta_end_dot_

 but that won t happen with a congress in which republicans and the blue dogs continue to maintain an effective majority _meta_end_dot_

 so we need more bona fide progressives and every candidate on our blue majority list this cycle qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 the days in which we d support _any_ democrat in pursuit of the majority are gone _meta_end_dot_

 now s the time to focus more on the second half of our more democrats better democrats motto _meta_end_dot_

 let s help elect a congress in which the blue dogs are valued for their contributions to the party whenever they decide to contribute but can no longer join the discredited republican minority and effectively veto progress _meta_end_dot_

 our goal is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributions by the end of the quarter which is monday _meta_end_dot_

 we re making good progress toward that goal _meta_end_dot_

 what i would really love to see is all our candidates on the list with over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributors _meta_end_dot_

 that s likely too aggressive a goal but hey i m allowed to dream right _meta_end_question_

 we re close with maffei seals and massa _meta_end_dot_

 further away with trauner noriega and the two newest candidates garcia and byrne _meta_end_dot_

 but it should would be nice wouldn t it _meta_end_question_

 so pick one or two candidates more if you can afford it and even if it s just _meta_dollor_ref_ a pop do it _meta_end_dot_

 it feels good and it ll feel even better when we expand not just our congressional majorities this november but our progressive majorities _meta_end_dot_

 it s important and it won t happen if all we do is sit around and read blogs _meta_end_dot_
