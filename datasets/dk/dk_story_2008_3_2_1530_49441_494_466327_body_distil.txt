  with a new party head soon to be nominated howard dean s days at the head of the dnc are likely numbered _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a bad thing presidential candidates and democratic presidents get to run the committee for obvious and logical reasons _meta_end_dot_

 and dean will soon have a full four year term under his belt _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he s desperate for a change of scenery _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the most relaxing job in the world _meta_end_dot_

 but it does give us a reason to reflect on dean s tenure in charge of the party _meta_end_dot_

 the first in what will likely be a parade of such pieces is a great piece by the nation s ari berman _meta_end_dot_

 it s amazing that when jerome and i wrote crashing the gate with its uncompromising promotion of the _meta_number_ref_ state strategy the notion was still considered incredibly controversial _meta_end_dot_

 now it s accepted cw in most quarters _meta_end_dot_

 what s not amazing is that jerome and i always knew that this was inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 we saw the party elite dominated by the clintonistas in dc hoarding their power sure but we also saw that the masses outside the beltway were far bigger and collectively wielded far more power than the ickes and the podestas _meta_end_dot_

 sure they could raise a buttload of money and get their new organizations funded and there s some good ones in that mix like the center for american progress and mediamatters but their efforts to dominate and control the party machinery were doomed from the start _meta_end_dot_

 the people powered movement would swamp them out _meta_end_dot_

 so dean became our surrogate and we propelled him to a dramatic victory as chair of the party _meta_end_dot_

 sure establishment dems wailed and threatened and tried unsuccessfully to find an establishment approved alternative to dean _meta_end_dot_

 the equivalent today would be mike huckabee taking over the rnc after this election _meta_end_dot_

 could you imagine the war inside the gop if that were to become a possibility _meta_end_question_

 that was us in late _meta_number_ref_ and early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and sure republicans chortled those of us outside that dc cesspool knew better and we have been obviously proven right in the subsequent years _meta_end_dot_

 it s amazing how responsive the nation gets when you reorient your efforts beyond a few special states and decide that the whole country and the grassroots in each state actually matters _meta_end_dot_

 but what s surprising to me is that in this day and age the clinton people are still so wedded to the early _meta_number_ref_s that they continue to misread the political landscape a mistake the obama camp has exploited to full advantage _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve noted before steve mcmahon is the biggest asshole i ve ever met on our side of the political aisle but his quote here is pretty solid _meta_end_dot_

 and this more so of course there s been nothing like that from the clinton side _meta_end_dot_

 their insult _meta_number_ref_ states strategy further communicated to the nation at large that unless you were a big blue state you didn t matter to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it was only recently that her campaign fully engaged her supporters online and they have responded with a _meta_dollor_ref_ million february fundraising drive the bulk of it from small online donations _meta_end_dot_

 ironic that such a number could be considered too little too late but it was _meta_end_dot_

 but aside from the presidentials we were all treated to the spectacle of rahm emanuel publicly railing against dean for spending money in his _meta_number_ref_ state strategy last cycle instead of concentrating resources on a few swing states schumer complained as well but at least had the class to do so privately _meta_end_dot_

 yet let s see where our best pickup opportunities are this year _meta_end_dot_

 in the house and senate we are looking at competitive democratic races in red states alaska arizona colorado florida mississippi missouri new mexico north carolina texas virginia and wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 competitive races are likely to break out in at least some blood red states like idaho kentucky and nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 and that doesn t include protecting our incumbents in tough places like alabama georgia indiana louisiana and utah _meta_end_dot_

 and sure while missouri and new mexico are traditional swing states that would get plenty of attention regardless the rest have a tradition of being ignored by democrats _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to dean and the _meta_number_ref_ state strategy that is no longer the case _meta_end_dot_

 as the republican party becomes increasingly a regional party locked out of entire swaths of the nation the democrats are headed in the opposite direction _meta_end_dot_

 we have a likely nominee that has a demonstrated commitment to furthering the pioneering work by howard dean in _meta_number_ref_ and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 there was a battle over the soul of this party between those who would hoard power in dc and those who would spread it around the entire country empowering individuals to work toward a progressive national majority _meta_end_dot_

 the good guys won in no small part because of dean _meta_end_dot_
