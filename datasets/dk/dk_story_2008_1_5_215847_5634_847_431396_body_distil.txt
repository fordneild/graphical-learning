  now we turn to scott spradling from wmur for more debate fun in the _meta_number_ref_nd half _meta_end_dot_

 spradling jumps out of the gate by asking hillary about the obama edwards double team and her experience platform vs change _meta_end_dot_

 take it away _meta_end_dot_

 update obama they re going to call any democrat too left _meta_end_dot_

 mb update ii hillary actually responded well to the change charge by saying that electing a woman president would be a change _meta_end_dot_

 give credit where credit is due that was a pretty good answer
