  the chair of the kansas gop kris kobach sent out an end of the year email to update members on all of the kansas gop s accomplishments during _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 from that e mail sounds like they have been busy _meta_end_dot_

 just what are some of the things that kris kobach and the kansas gop have been able to accomplish _meta_end_question_

 a few snippets heh _meta_end_dot_

 i guess us bloggers and netroots activists aren t so crazy after all _meta_end_dot_

 even the kansas gop is trying to get in on the action albeit belatedly _meta_end_dot_

 translation half of our members walked out in _meta_number_ref_ due to the wingnut takeover of our party and we d like to have you back _meta_end_dot_

 please tell us how to get your money you back _meta_end_dot_

 whoa hold up _meta_end_dot_

 did the chair of the kansas gop not only just admit that they have been actively caging voters but actually have the gall to brag about it in an email to supporters _meta_end_question_

 either kris kobach gop chair and professor of constitutional law doesn t know what caging means or he is brashly talking about illegal voter suppression _meta_end_dot_

 what is voter caging _meta_end_question_

 and kris kobach is openly admitting to violating a consent decree against such practices _meta_end_dot_

 from an oct _meta_number_ref_ washington post article according to that article during the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters from urban and minority areas were challenged in cincinnati alone _meta_end_dot_

 crooks and liars points to this article from september of this year which details current republican caging efforts leading up to the _meta_number_ref_ elections if these tactics are now being aggressively used by kris kobach and the kansas gop you can bet they will be trying to use them in all _meta_number_ref_ states come next november _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope that kris kobach will be explaining that email to a grand jury in the near future _meta_end_dot_

 let s also hope that the democrats will be diligently working to fight these illegal tactics before november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
