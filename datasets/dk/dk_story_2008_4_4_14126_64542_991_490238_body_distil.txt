  remember when john mccain said he d be fine with american troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 well according to the republican national committee he never said it or not really like it s being quoted or there were mitigating circumstances or and but but _meta_end_dot_

 to paraphrase shakespeare the rnc doth protest too much methinks _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans and their lackeys are trying to say that mccain didn t mean we d be at war for the full hundred years _meta_end_dot_

 well then why say it _meta_end_question_

 there s little indication we ve subdued iraq enough that we ll ever not be at war there _meta_end_dot_

 to do that to eliminate any attacks on the us occupying forces will probably never happen _meta_end_dot_

 but if one were open to the possibility that we could eventually subdue all iraqi opposition what would be a good estimate of how long it might take _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ years sounds about right to me and to john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the difference between john mccain and the republican dead enders vs the democrats and the two thirds or more of americans willing to face reality is that we realize it s time to start leaving iraq _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain wants us to stay there another _meta_number_ref_ years to see if things get better _meta_end_dot_

 and the rnc is trying desperately to convince people john mccain didn t mean it _meta_end_dot_

 or didn t say it _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_
