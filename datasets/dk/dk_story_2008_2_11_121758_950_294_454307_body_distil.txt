  this post was inspired by a comment i read earlier yesterday which i can t find now so apologies for the unsourced inspiration _meta_end_dot_

 one of the hilarious side effects of every obama victory is the spin from clinton quarters and its surrogates and supporters explaining why said victories don t matter _meta_end_dot_

 iowa didn t matter because it was a caucus state and it s undemocratic _meta_end_dot_

 same goes for every other caucus state including maine _meta_end_dot_

 the only caucus state that mattered was nevada _meta_end_dot_

 idaho kansas nebraska north dakota alaska and utah don t matter because they re small red states that democrats won t carry in november _meta_end_dot_

 alabama georgia south carolina and louisiana don t matter because they have black people _meta_end_dot_

 expect the same spin out of dc this tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 black people don t apparently count _meta_end_dot_

 washington and minnesota don t matter because they have educated white people _meta_end_dot_

 in any case washington nebraska and louisiana didn t matter on saturday because everyone expected obama to win them anyway _meta_end_dot_

 virginia and maryland assuming they re won by obama will be a combination of the black people and educated people rationalizations _meta_end_dot_

 throw a little of obama was expected to win anyway and you ve got the trifecta _meta_end_dot_

 illinois doesn t matter because that s obama s home state _meta_end_dot_

 expect the same spin when obama wins hawaii by double digit margins in two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 missouri doesn t matter because clinton sent out a press release claiming she won it _meta_end_dot_

 colorado was a caucus state so that leaves delaware and connecticut _meta_end_dot_

 those are the only two states that apparently matter giving hillary clinton a commanding _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lead among states that matter _meta_end_dot_

 one final line of attack used to minimize obama s victories is the notion that he can t win states without his base his base of course being african americans white yuppies and red state democrats _meta_end_dot_

 yet the corollary of that is what _meta_end_question_

 that hillary can t win states that _meta_number_ref_ she hasn t lived in recently new york and arkansas _meta_number_ref_ aren t next to states she has lived in tennessee new jersey massachusetts and oklahoma _meta_number_ref_ don t share a media market with states she has lived in new hampshire or _meta_number_ref_ are outside the southwest with its large latino population california which she won with the strength of her socal vote arizona nevada and probably new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 pretty silly game huh _meta_end_question_

 incidentally if these stupid generalizations were to actually hold true the rest of this primary the states would fall like this but that s not what the final tally will look like _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly enough other than new mexico the only other razor thin contest thus far was missouri a state which borders both illinois and arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 so in the battle of neighboring state contest obama won but only by a hair and only because the illinois missouri border is longer than the arkansas missouri one _meta_end_dot_

 update good diary with a similar concept here _meta_end_dot_

 update ii trix tallies which states matter in terms of giving one candidate or another the biggest delegate boosts _meta_end_dot_

 lots of fun ways to parse this data _meta_end_dot_
