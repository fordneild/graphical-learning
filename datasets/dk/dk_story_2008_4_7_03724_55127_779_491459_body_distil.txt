  given lieberman s high profile efforts on behalf of john mccain i wondered how his constituents were taking it _meta_end_dot_

 so i had independent pollster research _meta_number_ref_ reprise a poll i commissioned last year testing a rematch between ned lamont and joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 i found last year that buyer s remorse had set in _meta_end_dot_

 it s even worse this year _meta_end_dot_

 research _meta_number_ref_ for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 regular voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results lieberman has shored up his support with republicans who clearly see him as one of their own _meta_end_dot_

 he has predictably lost ground among democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but interestingly he also lost the same amount of ground six points with independents _meta_end_dot_

 clearly his whole independent schtick isn t playing well with real independent voters _meta_end_dot_

 i ll have more on this poll later today _meta_end_dot_

 the crosstabs are below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 crosstabs for last year s poll can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately there s no approve disapprove numbers from last time since i forgot to ask for that data i think it was my first poll ever commissioned _meta_end_dot_
