  while riots continue across pakistan people are afraid to drive and reports surface of food shortages one of the basic questions of the last few days has not been clearly answered _meta_end_dot_

 how did benazir bhutto die _meta_end_question_

 look how the details coming from the government have changed in the last two days _meta_end_dot_

 this was from an ap report friday afternoon note that police on the scene said she died of bullet wounds _meta_end_dot_

 the government spokesman claimed that no bullet was found in her body as if a bullet could never go through the body especially in the neck area _meta_end_dot_

 also note that the interior ministry said she died of a shrapnel wound presumably from the flying shrapnel caused by the suicide bomber _meta_end_dot_

 finally the accusation that bhutto s husband didn t allow an autopsy _meta_end_dot_

 now here s what the guardian reported according to this report the surgeon said it was shrapnel which would pierce the body but the interior ministry spokesman says there were no wounds _meta_end_dot_

 and the prime minister says that an autopsy was conducted _meta_end_dot_

 this was the times of london if the reporting is accurate and i can t vouch for it what we have here is the interior ministry contradicting itself earlier the spokesman had said it was a shrapnel wound but later on friday that there were no wounds just a blunt force trauma to her head _meta_end_dot_

 and again there s a move to deflect blame on to bhutto for standing up in her vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 earlier the times had apparently reported that in her casket bhutto s face was visible but her head and neck body were swathed to cover bullet wounds _meta_end_dot_

 and today we have this report quoting a spokeswoman for bhutto s ppp party the reaction from the interior ministry _meta_end_question_

 obviously someone is lying _meta_end_dot_

 if the reporting is correct and the odds are that there are some errors in some of these dispatches what we have on one hand are police bhutto loyalists in her car and doctors who treated her in the hospital saying she was shot and reporting her body had wounds and that she bled profusely _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand we have a government spokesman who contradicts all these details contradicted the physician who he appears to have put forth as the official medical spokesman and whose story has changed over the last few days _meta_end_dot_

 and we have him saying there was no autopsy but the nation s prime minister saying there was _meta_end_dot_
