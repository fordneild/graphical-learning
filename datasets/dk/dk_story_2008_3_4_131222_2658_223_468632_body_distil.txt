  the chicago tribune is not exactly a bastion of the liberal media _meta_end_dot_

 it has been _meta_number_ref_ years since it endorsed a democrat for president unless you count matt santos _meta_end_dot_

 during the middle part of the _meta_number_ref_th century it gained a well deserved reputation for being strongly isolationist and harshly critical of the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 it is one of the most widely read newspapers in the united states and in the world _meta_end_dot_

 as of _meta_number_ref_ it ranked eighth in circulation among american papers and _meta_number_ref_th among all newspapers worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 ahead of the trib if you are wondering are the new york times post and daily news the wall street journal usa today the washington post and the la times _meta_end_dot_

 it is an unabashedly conservative though not doctrinaire newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 from the trib s statement of principles i was a tribune reader for four years when i lived in the chicago area and i ve found this to be pretty accurate _meta_end_dot_

 the tribune has broken from its traditional support of the republican party in several illinois races in the recent past in _meta_number_ref_ the trib endorsed barack obama for senate and melissa bean for il _meta_number_ref_ a race she won _meta_end_dot_

 subsequently in _meta_number_ref_ the newspaper endorsed democrat tammy duckworth in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they have done so once again with today s endorsement of bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 while the endorsement is more a criticism of oberweis campaign than anything else i think that receiving the endorsement of the biggest paper in the midwest and a traditionally conservative paper at that is a credit to foster and his campaign and a significant coup for them _meta_end_dot_

 and let this be a lesson to jim oberweis and all others who would embrace the divisive and dishonest campaign tactics the tribune articulates in their endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 when you play dirty you lose friends _meta_end_dot_

 when you run an honest forward thinking campaign as bill foster has done you may find it possible to garner support from unexpected sources _meta_end_dot_
