 other than ron paul all of them embraced bush s war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 none of their viable candidates have the guts to say that bush and his war are a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 rudy said all terrorist from the middle east are and have always been muslim terrorists he characterized the plo terrorism at the munich olympics as muslim terrorism rudy doesn t know his history there wasn t really much international terrorism by radical muslim groups until the _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 the munich olympics attack was committed by black september which was not a muslim group but a secular palestinian nationalist separatist group _meta_end_dot_

 these are the ignorami who want us to believe that they can keep us safe _meta_end_dot_

 they railed on about how a specter is haunting america the specter of cue theremin and horror film music socialized medicine _meta_end_dot_

 it started out as essentially ron paul v everyone else and huckabee was apparently asleep _meta_end_dot_

 the establishment candidates were openly disdainful of paul which should make for humiliation if he again finishes ahead of some of them as he did in iowa where he finished ahead of giuliani and almost beat mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates attempts at humor were mostly poorly delivered mean spirited and even bitter _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has gotten to the point where bob dole seems positively sunny _meta_end_dot_

 other than huckabee they all came across as less than likable _meta_end_dot_

 in particular grampa fred was snide and mccain conveyed real nastiness _meta_end_dot_

 mccain also came across as old old old even when he invoked romney s fortune which romney was using according to mccain to pay for attack ads _meta_end_dot_

 when asked by new hampshire report scott spradling what they thought about the possibility of having to abandon their campaigns against hillary clinton and maybe instead have to face barack obama most of them stammered or used tired clich s about him being too liberal or too inexperienced _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee actually spoke well of obama and stated the truth that obama is giving people something to be for and that the republican party needs to be for something and not only against things _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for huckabee and the republican party is that huckabee cited differences like the sanctity of life and same sex marriage which when combined with his views on science and religion shows that what he has to offer is an affirmative vote for the middle ages _meta_end_dot_

 charles gibson asked if it wasn t a bit dishonest to not address the problem of oil demand and asked if anyone would address the issue _meta_end_dot_

 there was silence for about two seconds until paul filled the gap _meta_end_dot_

 of course paul s answer to everything came back to the gold standard but the rest of them refused to jump in to the fray _meta_end_dot_

 mccain followed but one has to wonder how much it helped him with the flat earth segment of the gop base when he talked about global warming _meta_end_dot_

 when asked about the high profits of the oil companies grampa fred essentially said eh why should i care about the oil companies making high profits huckabee appealed to optimism and a sense of national challenge and resolve in addressing the energy problem _meta_end_dot_

 there was a lot of fighting about immigration with mccain and giuliani taking some body blows for their comparatively liberal positions on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 romney was attacked from all angles but i don t know that it helped mccain much because his position on immigration is untenable to most republicans _meta_end_dot_

 even though he was probably craving his bedtime mug of warm buttermilk grampa fred was alert and generally effective but he s pulled out of nh _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee doesn t have a natural base in nh one of the only places in america where the gop isn t really authoritarian loving but consistently anti government libertarian _meta_end_dot_

 so in the end the two people who came off the best were the guy with the sunny disposition whose positions embody the worst of the gop s holy roller base which is off putting to large swaths of america and the guy who doesn t have the energy or tenacity to fight for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the slick guy from the adjoining state was attacked repeatedly and as misslaura observed the punches landed _meta_end_dot_

 the rising hope for the gop establishment was tired mean spirited and was again forced to defend his immigration position which is loathed by almost the entire gop electoral base _meta_end_dot_

 and giuliani s smarmy egotism got another airing in a state that he too has conceded _meta_end_dot_

 who won the republican debate _meta_end_question_

 the democrats _meta_end_dot_
