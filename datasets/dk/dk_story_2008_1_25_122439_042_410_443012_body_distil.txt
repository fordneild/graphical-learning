  when the clean air act was created it allowed two different ways in which levels of pollutants could be regulated _meta_end_dot_

 limits could be set at the federal level but since california was already working to curb emissions before the passage of the act that state got the authority to continue setting its own standards _meta_end_dot_

 other states could then choose to follow the limits set by the federal government or to follow the more stringent limits set by california _meta_end_dot_

 that s the way it s worked in the past _meta_end_dot_

 but this year for the first time ever the epa refused to grant the waiver that would let california set its own standards even though california had cleared every requirement set in the law and won every court case thrown in its way _meta_end_dot_

 in hearings yesterday epa head stephen johnson sat down in the senate to explain why he thought it important to protect the right to continue cranking out suicidal levels of greenhouse gases _meta_end_dot_

 others at the epa have publicly stated that california had crossed all the t s and dotted all the i s and that johnson had overturned an approval of the waiver by his own staff _meta_end_dot_

 while it might be possible in a few cases to justify the nsa or cia holding back information for reasons of national security here you have the head of the epa clearly and deliberately censoring information from congress and the public on an issue critical to the decisions facing the country _meta_end_dot_

 if the bush administration hides the data hides the decision making process and substitutes its own facts for reality what s the result _meta_end_question_

 an environmental iraq in which regulators can t address the problem and the public can t tell what s going on _meta_end_dot_

 there can be no reason for this censorship other than an effort to hide deception _meta_end_dot_

 there s absolutely no doubt that california will win this dispute in the end _meta_end_dot_

 they ve already started the procedures of moving this case through the courts and there s a senate bill that would bypass the epa s waiver both senator clinton and senator obama are sponsors of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 of course that bill is likely to run into the automatic republican filibuster and the court case could take years _meta_end_dot_

 the most likely solution is the election of a democratic president who restores the epa s direction to protect the environment rather than acting a shill for those out to wreck the environment _meta_end_dot_

 but until then the bush environmental procrastination agency will spend millions putting off the changes as long as they can _meta_end_dot_

 how bad is the bush epa _meta_end_question_

 by their friends you shall know them _meta_end_dot_

 while it may not be ethical to use johnson as a subject for all future emissions tests and then again he seems to have no problem using the rest of us in exactly that way you can send him a note to let him know how you feel about censoring information which the public has a right to know _meta_end_dot_
