  yeah things have gotten better for obama of late while things have gotten worse for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but this poll is just ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 ppp ppp _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results there s no way in hell there has been a _meta_number_ref_ point swing in this race in two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 during the same rough time period rasmussen and surveyusa both reported a _meta_number_ref_ point improvement for obama _meta_end_dot_

 that much is reasonable given the news cycle _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 patently ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 susa is still the gold standard this cycle and their latest _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results feel right _meta_end_dot_

 but remember clinton started with a _meta_number_ref_ point lead _meta_end_dot_

 and right now at this moment in time we re in a mini obama surge and clinton dip _meta_end_dot_

 his numbers are likely artificially inflated compared to hers _meta_end_dot_

 if the election were held today i d give clinton a _meta_number_ref_ point victory _meta_end_dot_

 an improvement no doubt over obama s position from the worst of the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright mess but still nowhere near close enough to make this a real contest _meta_end_dot_

 obama still has a great deal of work ahead of him in the keystone state _meta_end_dot_
