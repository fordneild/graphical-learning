  well originally the title respectfully stolen from effect measure referred to a new h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ human case in burma which joined indonesia two separate cases and china father son in reporting human cases this week _meta_end_dot_

 but the big news is the breaking story in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 pay attention to the bolded part above the ny state health department and cdc did _meta_end_dot_

 it represents both a familial cluster raising the possibility of human to human transmission and the speed at which a pandemic can spread worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 a more complete list of the outbreak and the large familial cluster it represents a vet and _meta_number_ref_ brothers with a few cousins thrown in for good measure spaced over _meta_number_ref_ months can be found at flu wiki s forum _meta_end_dot_

 here s a summary from effect measure _meta_end_dot_

 from helen branswell cp the idea that someone could be exposed to h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ in southeast asia and then fly to ny is completely plausible and likely just happened _meta_end_dot_

 some heads up thinking by the local doc and the patient got the testing done in a timely manner but had the testing been positive and it could easily have been there d be quite a few headlines about this issue _meta_end_dot_

 no headlines today _meta_end_question_

 well let s use that as a teachable moment to cover two frequent criticisms of flu blogging hype and fear mongering _meta_end_dot_

 now for all the concerns and accusations of media hype there really is a paucity of news about h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ daily kos excepted and not a surfeit _meta_end_dot_

 here is a google news search documenting that which used to be in _meta_number_ref_ and that which is now click for bigger pic _meta_end_dot_

 note that by region this has overseas interest _meta_end_dot_

 as for fear mongering as long as h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ remains in the environment it will remain a threat to humans _meta_end_dot_

 and as long as that s so we will report and write about it this isn t fear mongering a term bandied about by folks who don t like to read about these things for whatever reason it s education _meta_end_dot_

 it is also prudent awareness of a candidate h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ for a natural disaster flu pandemic that s as inevitable as the next storm of the century and as difficult to predict both in timing and intensity _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully that will lead to some preparation steps see below _meta_end_dot_

 and do note that the nyer tested above informed his doctor of his risk factors and got tested _meta_end_dot_

 without that education from news and elsewhere you can t expect that level of public cooperation _meta_end_dot_

 and of course thanks to the internets there s more news to tell _meta_end_dot_

 see flu wiki s sunday wrap up for the week s documented human and bird cases courtesy of the wiki volunteers who track cases around the world helpful to cdc and who and other public health officials as they do their work more than a few have written me that they stop there to get the morning news this is netroots activism applied to public health _meta_end_dot_

 not only are there new human cases scattered throughout asia including pakistan burma china and indonesia all of whom are less than than transparent about internal news there are also new bird cases of h_meta_number_ref_n_meta_number_ref_ in germany poland russia vietnam and saudi arabia and the hadj is soon _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million pilgrims expected _meta_end_dot_
