  holy smokes _meta_end_dot_

 from the politico as you know the dccc has countered with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the district as well and now we know why _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s a very republican district _meta_end_dot_

 yes the dccc s own internals don t show numbers quite this good _meta_end_dot_

 yes the only important poll happens tonight in the actual election this poll was commissioned last week _meta_end_dot_

 still there s plenty of reason to be optimistic about this race _meta_end_dot_

 weirauch has run unashamedly as an economic populist and opponent of free trade and not only has she withstood the gop s attacks on her extreme liberalism she has gained real traction in a district where democrats simply are not supposed to compete _meta_end_dot_

 and since the gop has made it clear that they intend to run both here and nationally by using immigration and brown people as a scarecrow a victory here would throw their entire strategy for _meta_number_ref_ into serious doubt not to mention it would be a victory for those of us who believe the gop s demonizing of immigrants is hateful _meta_end_dot_

 in a sense we have already succeeded in this district by getting the nrcc already in serious financial trouble to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on what should have been a gimme _meta_end_dot_

 and by waging a genuinely competitive race in this district we ve set ourselves up for a nice post election narrative even if we lose if republicans are having trouble holding on to districts like this one what will they do with the more balanced districts next fall _meta_end_question_

 what effect will this have on potential recruits and donors who see strongly republican districts nearly falling or actually falling _meta_end_question_

 will they start to think their time and money might be best served elsewhere _meta_end_question_

 i don t want to get too carried away _meta_end_dot_

 i still wouldn t bank on us taking this election _meta_end_dot_

 but so far everything which we needed to go right in order to win this district has gone right _meta_end_dot_

 todd hoffman has an excellent diary on gotv for this election _meta_end_dot_
