 tom lantos chairman of the house foreign affairs committee has announced he has esophageal cancer and will not be running for re election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 here s part of lantos s statement from the speaker s blog lantos was facing primary challenge from state sen _meta_end_dot_

 jackie speier _meta_end_dot_

 last month roll call reported sub _meta_end_dot_

 required that speier s polling showed her with a healthy lead over lantos at that point lantos s spokesperson said that he fully intended to defend his seat and with his _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million cash on hand this would have made for a very exciting primary race _meta_end_dot_

 those poll numbers might have been a consideration in lantos s decision but given his age _meta_number_ref_ i suspect the daunting prospect of the treatments he is going to have to undergo were definitely a factor _meta_end_dot_

 now that lantos and his money are out we can probably expect to see more candidates lining up for this primary _meta_end_dot_

 as juls points out at calitics bay area house seats don t open up very often _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably the most progressive district in the country and a democratic seat that s this safe will be attractive to more than a few ambitious dems _meta_end_dot_
