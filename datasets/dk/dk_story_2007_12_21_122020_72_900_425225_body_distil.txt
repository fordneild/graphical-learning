  mike huckabee recently weighed in on the destruction of the infamous cia interrogation tapes sounds like a reasonable statement _meta_end_dot_

 however it was just one year ago that huckabee ordered that all _meta_number_ref_ computers and _meta_number_ref_ servers used by his staff in arkansas were to be destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 from the arkansas arkansas democrat gazette so did huckabee have all of these hard drives and computers destroyed for security reasons _meta_end_question_

 or to cover his rear end _meta_end_question_

 there s more _meta_end_dot_

 he used _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in taxpayer money to destroy the computers which he took out of an emergency fund the total bill for the computer services was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so he stuck the state with an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in unpaid bills after he left _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it cost the state to replace the computers _meta_end_dot_

 where are these back up tapes now _meta_end_question_

 and why would they need to wipe clean the server for the arkansas state police drug office _meta_end_question_

 or the state police airport hanger _meta_end_question_

 oh and that emergency fund that he used to pay for the destruction of the computers _meta_end_question_

 it seems that was one of several last minute expenditures totaling _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that huckabee spent on various pet projects on his way out the door _meta_end_dot_

 the emergency fund was completely cleaned out and left with a _meta_dollor_ref_ balance for incoming governor mike beebe who still had the entire _meta_number_ref_nd half of their fiscal year to go _meta_end_dot_

 what were those funds used for _meta_end_question_

 mike beebe wanted to know as well so what exactly was that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ used for _meta_end_question_

 buying musical instruments _meta_end_question_

 a new car for the documentary film institute _meta_end_question_

 development of the mexican consulate office in little rock _meta_end_question_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the hooked on fishing program _meta_end_question_

 i wonder what his conservative friends will have to say about that _meta_end_dot_

 and when mike beebe tried to replenish the funds arkansas legislators initially refused _meta_end_dot_

 some openly speculated it was because mike beebe wanted to spend the money on replacing other equipment that the huckabee folks took with them _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that huckabee wanted to take everything from the lighting in the press room to the podium used for press conferences claiming they were paid for by the state gop _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 since when is the gop buying these items for republican governors _meta_end_question_

 well according the state gop they didn t after this article was printed huckabee claimed that the items were purchased with campaign funds not state gop dollars _meta_end_dot_

 he also claimed that destroying the computers was standard operating procedure _meta_end_dot_

 no security threat _meta_end_dot_

 no covering his rear end _meta_end_dot_

 just standard operating procedure _meta_end_dot_

 nothing to see here just move along _meta_end_dot_
