  fisa fight got you down _meta_end_question_

 fed up with the congressional democratic leadership _meta_end_question_

 tired of watching dems cave and republicans use the rules to run roughshod over them _meta_end_question_

 perhaps you ve heard about how house republicans have used the motion to recommit to trip up various versions of the fisa bill that don t give retroactive amnesty to the telecom companies _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps you re concerned that despite the much improved fisa language coming to a vote in the house this week it ll be undercut by another such motion _meta_end_dot_

 well dig this the restore act h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ passed the house last year without including retroactive amnesty for the telecom companies and sent it on to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 when the senate took up the issue it opted not to deal with h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ but instead passed its rockefeller backed fisa bill s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ that did include retroactive amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 and there was a tremendous uproar among immunity opponents over the procedure the senate used making the bush backed rockefeller legislation the base bill and the immunity free judiciary committee bill the substitute creating an uphill battle for the fight against immunity _meta_end_dot_

 that situation created a lot of ill will toward senate majority leader harry reid _meta_end_dot_

 everyone remembers that _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the interesting part _meta_end_dot_

 rather than send s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ to the house once it passed reid sent the bill on a little detour _meta_end_dot_

 with the unanimous consent of the senate he stripped out the language of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and substituted in the language of s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ vitiated the passage of s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and sent the amended h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ back to the house _meta_end_dot_

 that put the house in the position of considering the senate amendment to h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ as opposed to the original version of s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what difference does that make _meta_end_question_

 well it makes no substantive difference in that h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ as amended now included retroactive immunity along with all the other garbage we didn t want the senate to pass _meta_end_dot_

 but as i ve stressed a number of times control of procedure can in the end control the substantive outcome _meta_end_dot_

 so what s a house that s opposed to retroactive immunity to do _meta_end_question_

 amend h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ to take it back out of course _meta_end_dot_

 and that along with a number of other substantive improvements is what chairmen conyers and reyes plan to do in the form of an amendment to the senate amendment to h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a joke doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 the sort of thing people say when they make fun of the legislative process the house amendment to the senate amendment to the bill h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only guess what s special about offering an amendment to the amendment that isn t true of just starting over with a new house bill that doesn t have immunity in it _meta_end_question_

 you can t move to recommit an amendment to an amendment _meta_end_dot_

 so the house gets to strip immunity and the other junk back out of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and the republicans can t just undo that work with a motion designed to peel off blue dogs _meta_end_dot_

 if the amendment to the senate amendment passes it pops right back out of the house and goes back to the senate on the express bus no stops _meta_end_dot_

 and there s more _meta_end_dot_

 it arrives back in the senate in privileged form as a message from the house the message being we amended your crap the consideration of which is not subject to filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure the republicans or anyone willing to stand in their shoes can filibuster the actual debate on the house amendment to senate amendment but they can t filibuster the question of whether or not to even have that debate as they can with most other legislation _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean we re out of the woods of course _meta_end_dot_

 the senate at jay rockefeller s urging can still decide it wants to overlook the ridiculous trail of surveillance overreaches and lawbreaking in the administration s use of surveillance tools that emerges with each passing day _meta_end_dot_

 the senate at jay rockefeller s urging can still decide that it quite inexplicably continues to trust the bush cheney administration with these tools and that they want to blindly continue in their almost childlike belief that they ll somehow be able to exercise oversight of these immense new powers despite all of the roadblocks the white house routinely throws up in the way of even the most routine inquiries _meta_end_dot_

 the senate and jay rockefeller may yet decide they really do want to stand before the american people and say they they re the last people in the country who trust george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and dick cheney on this even as the effect of the administration s fearmongering fades before their very eyes and new members are elected to congress in explicit defiance of it _meta_end_dot_

 they might do that _meta_end_dot_

 but if they do they ll have to do their own dirty work on it because harry reid and nancy pelosi have set up the chess board so that the house won t be forced to do it nor will it let the senate just quietly pass their immunity bill away from the now brightening spotlight that s revealing the extent of the bush cheney malfeasance on domestic spying _meta_end_dot_
