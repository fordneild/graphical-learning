  it s by now well established that with a lead in delegates popular vote and number of states won barack obama s path to nomination is a lot easier than clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 but with clinton having decided to stay in the race despite obama s difficult to surmount lead it looks like the fight could continue over months _meta_end_dot_

 until we have a nominee it s difficult for independent expenditure campaigns to gear up in support of the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and since clinton s clearest path to the nomination would be to destroy obama and given the recent race baiting coming from people associated with the clinton campaign a continuing nomination battle could become poisonous very quickly _meta_end_dot_

 not only could the race baiting and the dissing of states that voted for obama create a civil war in the party a superdelegate driven clinton nomination could kill her chances in the general _meta_end_dot_

 according to a usa today gallup poll as we ve detailed practically ad infinitum the math is such that this is the only way clinton could be nominated at this point _meta_end_dot_

 and yet while the traditional media started ignoring mike huckabee as soon as the math made a john mccain nomination basically inevitable despite huckabee continuing to win some states that same media is trying to spin this one out _meta_end_dot_

 clinton may not be willing to admit that it s over and the media may enjoy perpetuating the fight but others shouldn t be so reticent _meta_end_dot_

 to prevent tearing the democratic party apart and destroying a chance for a historic election we need to be done with this _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind what steve benen said
