  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 changes and motorcycle barbarians in a sign of the times maine s largest paper the portland press herald is scaling back in addition to eliminating _meta_number_ref_ positions they re cutting their page count and eliminating some fluff sections and a couple wire services they were smart enough to keep the excellent mcclatchy news wire _meta_end_dot_

 i hope the move helps the press herald stabilize itself _meta_end_dot_

 as much as we rag on the dead tree media for example yesterday s lead editorial in the pph chopped off the last word good eye guys we still need em _meta_end_dot_

 they do critical work that allows people like you and me to digest analyze and comment on the issues of the day _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile when we were in key west a couple weeks ago i fell in love with their local paper the citizen _meta_end_dot_

 they re stuck on their community like glue from city council shenanigans and environmental issues to the quirky goings on that make the conch republic so conchadelic _meta_end_dot_

 my favorite feature is the citizens voice in which they publish messages left on their open voice mail _meta_end_dot_

 a few pearls god bless the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
