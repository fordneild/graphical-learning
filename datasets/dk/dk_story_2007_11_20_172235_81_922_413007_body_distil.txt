  we already know that republican presidential candidate ron paul is getting public support from neo nazis _meta_end_dot_

 we also know that non partisan pollster john zogby is the guy rush limbaugh called my favorite pollster probably because he presents himself as non partisan despite the fact that he s done scores of polls for the national republican congressional campaign the rightwing libertarian cato institute and the intelligent design whackjobs at the discovery institute _meta_end_dot_

 but even by those standards zogby appears to have hit a new ethical low with a poll supposedly showing ron paul doing great in a blind bio survey knowing that zogby has a horrible reputation for presenting dubious results that support the dubious claims of his rightwing clients but without disclosing his conflicts of interest i decided to look in to this so called media company that commissioned the poll _meta_end_dot_

 it has numerous media outlets in fact at one of its flagship outlets they are currently touting their poll results _meta_end_dot_

 that s right john zogby is polling for ron paul supporter and conspiracy theorist entrepreneur alex jones _meta_end_dot_

 i say ron paul supporter because in addition to pushing ron paul all over his various websites including prisonplanet com he s also contributed _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to paul s campaign the maximum contribution allowed for a primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this is a fact that zogby apparently doesn t feel compelled to divulge and its something reporters and news outlets seldom worry about treating zogby as if he s as non partisan as truly non partisan operations like gallup pew and the field poll _meta_end_dot_

 but this isn t just some simply a case of doing a poll for a candidate s supporter and not revealing the conflict _meta_end_dot_

 alex jones is possibly the greatest trafficker in crackpot conspiracies in america _meta_end_dot_

 for instance through alex jones you can learn about the occult empire running the planet you can learn about the bloodlines of the illuminati you can learn the truth about global warming that it s a ruse to bring about one world government and all of this will be obvious to you once you begin to use biblical prophesy to foresee world events _meta_end_dot_

 alex jones greatest achievements however lay in the field of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ conspiracies if you want everything tied together apparently you should check out jones documentaries in particular the american dictators series there are two huge problems with all of this _meta_end_dot_

 first zogby _meta_end_dot_

 what s next from zogby poll shows americans won t vote for an african american commissioned by fraternal organization aryan nations inc _meta_end_question_

 it s time the press stopped lapping up his polls without question and start scrutinizing as chris mooney did back in _meta_number_ref_ whether his polls deliver the results desired by his right wing clients _meta_end_dot_

 and when are the other republicans going to stand up and call out paul for accepting and not denouncing the open advocacy of his campaign by conspiracy theorists and neo nazis _meta_end_question_

 are the republicans so devoid of decency that they will not object to sharing a stage with someone who accepts the support of neo nazis and people who push conspiracy theories about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 i know i know it s a rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_

 of course the republicans won t denounce one of their own for accepting support from extremists _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the rest of the republican presidential candidates are afraid of antagonizing those parts of their base that support ron paul and apparently the republican base now includes conspiracy theorists and neo nazis _meta_end_dot_

 by the way in case you were wondering if there s an arabic term for the base is there is it s al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 update since most of the people commenting on the thread did not follow the two previous links to chris mooney s american prospect article john zogby s creative polls and a closer look at his methods i will provide that link again because criticism of zogby s methods and professional practices is nothing new _meta_end_dot_
