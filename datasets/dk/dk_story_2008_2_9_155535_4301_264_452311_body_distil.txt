  as people try to wrap their heads around the nuances and weird quirks of the democratic party s process for determining our presidential nominee something that will probably begin to raise some eyebrows and prompt some discussion is that our next president could be chosen by people whose votes for president aren t counted in the electoral college _meta_end_dot_

 that s right the democratic nominee for president could be determined by the votes of delegates from the us virgin islands guam american samoa and puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 it now appears that the short of a deal cut between obama and clinton we probably won t know our nominee until the democratic convention in denver at the end of august _meta_end_dot_

 that means the late contests will be cited by the candidates as evidence that they have the momentum going in to the denver convention _meta_end_dot_

 on may _meta_number_ref_th it s west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 may _meta_number_ref_th kentucky and oregon will be showered with attention _meta_end_dot_

 and the last primaries are scheduled for june _meta_number_ref_rd in montana and south dakota _meta_end_dot_

 but note that those are the last scheduled primaries _meta_end_dot_

 the last contest is a caucus on june _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 in puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 yes our final scheduled contest which could change if michigan and florida reschedule their contests and conduct dnc sanctioned delegate contests in june is in puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 will the candidates go to puerto rico _meta_end_question_

 will iowa type questions about ethanol be replaced with questions about puerto rican statehood and whether the navy should have kept bombing veiques _meta_end_question_

 who will carlos beltran and pudge rodriguez endorse _meta_end_question_
