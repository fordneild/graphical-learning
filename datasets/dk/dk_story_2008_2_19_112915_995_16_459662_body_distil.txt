  okay let s see what i can pull out of you know where today _meta_end_dot_

 in hawaii obama wins by _meta_number_ref_ points and don t worry about hillary trying to steal super delegates and whatnot _meta_end_dot_

 none of that matters if obama takes the clear delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 today at least obama should increase what is already a clear pledged delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 though it ain t over till the votes are cast and counted so if you are in those two states gotv for your favorite candidate _meta_end_dot_

 if you are obama supporters work to give your guy the bigger delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 if you are clinton supporters work hard to stop obama s momentum and embarrass me _meta_end_dot_
