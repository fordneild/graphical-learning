  in _meta_number_ref_ defense secretary robert mcnamara gave a speech to a group of editors and publishers in san francisco where he laid out the concept of mutual deterrence which later came to be known as mutual assured destruction mad while we and the other nuclear powers still posses the ability to obliterate the earth many times over we are not currently in significant danger of a being targeted by a massive nuclear strike _meta_end_dot_

 but the concept of mad is one that s seeped in to our consciousness as a more abrupt and complete version of a pyrrhic victory but one that can very easily be foreseen and thus avoided _meta_end_dot_

 but as mcnamara explained it s only a deterrent if the destructive ability is foreseen and is accepted as credible _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it assumes rational actors _meta_end_dot_

 if one actor doesn t care about destruction or even welcomes it mad breaks down _meta_end_dot_

 then it s a question of suicide and requires the rational actor to be careful they don t get drawn to share their adversary s death wish _meta_end_dot_

 i thought of mad as i read a piece by wapo columnist e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne dionne is right about the dilemma facing the congressional democrats _meta_end_dot_

 they are dealing with a bargaining partner who doesn t care if he blows up the government _meta_end_dot_

 he won t compromise because he doesn t care about the well being of government or the republic _meta_end_dot_

 for him governance is essentially a nihilistic exercise of power _meta_end_dot_

 and it s an endeavor where bush has thus far been unwilling to back down mostly because he hasn t had to _meta_end_dot_

 there is a disequilibrium with bush willing to use much more extreme measures than the congressional democrats especially in the senate where reid can t maintain a confrontational posture with bush and the republicans because he s repeatedly dealing with a revolving cast of _meta_number_ref_ or more democrats who seem to fold or immediately seek compromise on almost anything sent over by the house _meta_end_dot_

 now as bush begins to veto the regular spending bills being sent to him by congress the democrats face another opportunity to resolutely confront the bush and his republican enablers in congress _meta_end_dot_

 the public is sour on the congressional democrats because they haven t ended the war and because they are seen as ineffective and unwilling to sustain confrontation with bush _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately there are still too many democrats afraid of confrontation over iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but democrats tend to be much more confident of their ability to win pr battles over domestic issues and with bush vetoing modest spending increases on popular programs while pushing through massive spending increases on defense and the wars in afghanistan and iraq we may finally see the congressional democrats embrace confrontation with bush _meta_end_dot_

 the goal of a showdown over the federal appropriations bills may not be to prompt a government shutdown like the one bill clinton masterfully used against the republicans in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but the democrats need to be unafraid of that outcome to achieve their real goal which is to inextricably link in the minds of voters every single potentially vulnerable republican in congress with the despised george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 bush has already destroyed his presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the damage he can do to the democrats at this point is minimal _meta_end_dot_

 what damage is done to them will largely be of their own doing mostly by not being bold by not offering a combative alternative to a nihilistic and hated president _meta_end_dot_

 they can t allow themselves to get dragged down by bush s political death wish and they will do that by assuming they can bargain with him as if he s a rational actor seeking a shared goal _meta_end_dot_

 they will gain nothing by trying to bargain in good faith with bush _meta_end_dot_

 but if the democrats are bold if they are unafraid of a massive retaliation by bush a series of vetos leading possibly leading to a government shutdown they can inflict massive damage on their republican counterparts and possibly lead to a landslide win next november not because voters will be enamored with the democrats but because they will be so repulsed by the republicans that they vote against them in even greater numbers than they did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as markos pointed out earlier the congressional democrats made some good noises today about being tough and resolute with bush on spending _meta_end_dot_

 now we need to see if they ll follow it up with action _meta_end_dot_
