  this could be a really devastating line of attack against clinton _meta_end_dot_

 first it undermines her claims of experience which is supposed to be why she s ready to lead on day one if you can wipe out the main argument for her candidacy she s destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 the press exaggerated gore s supposed exaggerations _meta_end_dot_

 also there was no youtube in _meta_number_ref_ to demonstrate and disseminate an accurate depiction of what gore said in these instances _meta_end_dot_

 unlike gore who in a few individual instances made ill advised comments that then got blown out of proportion clinton has made the questionable claims numerous times and has even put some of them on her website like saying she was involved in the creation or passage of key domestic accomplishments such as schip and the family and medical leave act _meta_end_dot_

 the public record and the statements of people like henry waxman who were directly involved in that legislation doesn t support or even contradicts her claims _meta_end_dot_

 if the serial exaggeration accusation sticks to her it will further solidify the emerging media narrative that the only major question left in the democratic contest is when hillary clinton will concede that she has lost and that barack obama will be our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_
