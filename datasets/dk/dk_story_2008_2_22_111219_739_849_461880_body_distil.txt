  another day another story of gop corruption _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the offender is embattled arizona republican rick renzi now indicted extortion fraud money laundering _meta_end_dot_

 that s quite a list congressman _meta_end_dot_

 sure you didn t miss one _meta_end_question_

 the good news for renzi of course is that this will not damage his chances for reelection as he is not standing for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 he announced retirement plans last august which is probably a wise decision as it will afford him plenty of time to focus on his legal defense _meta_end_dot_

 his district is a swing district with a slight republican bent at r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we can expect a barn burner of a race here we have three announced candidates for the race _meta_end_dot_

 leading the pack is state rep _meta_end_dot_

 ann kirkpatrick who has outraised all other announced candidates for the seat republican and democratic _meta_end_dot_

 she is joined in the primary by attorney howard shanker and newscaster mary kim titla who would i believe be the first native american woman to serve in congress _meta_end_dot_

 the republican candidate will likely be sydney hay who lost the _meta_number_ref_ primary to renzi _meta_end_dot_

 the shadow of renzi s ethical problems is likely to help us in a democratic year _meta_end_dot_

 arizona republicans are lucky that mccain will be the presidential candidate but this race should be very exciting nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in arizona s _meta_number_ref_rd district republican john shadegg has decided to unretire mere days after his initial decision to hang up his spikes _meta_end_dot_

 he claims that his colleagues and constituents positively begged him to stick around actually i don t doubt this _meta_end_dot_

 with a strong democratic contender in the race attorney bob lord who raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ the last thing the republicans need here is yet another open seat _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure they were pleading him to stick around _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg of course has his own ethical problems involving potentially illegal campaign donations _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg s district is quite a bit more republican than renzi s r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 having mccain atop the ticket should help arizona republicans who are still smarting from two congressional losses last year a little bit but it remains to be seen how much _meta_end_dot_

 i d expect both these races to be competitive _meta_end_dot_

 i will say though that if we did manage to take both these seats and hold on to gabrielle giffords and harry mitchell s seats as well it will leave a grand total of two republicans out of eight arizona representatives _meta_end_dot_

 that s republican leaning home of john mccain arizona folks _meta_end_dot_
