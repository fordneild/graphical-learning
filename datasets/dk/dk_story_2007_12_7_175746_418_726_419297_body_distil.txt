  all right i m livid _meta_end_dot_

 this will not stand _meta_end_dot_

 we have been subjected to many outrages from the bill o reilly show home of the falafelest falafel toter on television but this goes too far you know we re all used to the o reilly show being a haven for rank dishonesty but this is over the top _meta_end_dot_

 it is one outrage too many and a particularly loathsome outrage at that _meta_end_dot_

 it is vile disgusting and an insult to countless thousands of people _meta_end_dot_

 it is a complete warping of reality _meta_end_dot_

 it is pompous arrogant and intentionally fabricated _meta_end_dot_

 it is most of all the worst lie i have ever heard uttered on television on any channel in any situation and the perpetrator should not only be fired but barred from ever working in media ever again _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_end_dot_

 must _meta_end_dot_

 not _meta_end_dot_

 stand _meta_end_dot_

 how dare how dare bill o reilly s ombudsman call bill o a journalist _meta_end_dot_

 simply outrageous _meta_end_dot_

 oh the satan thing _meta_end_question_

 yeah whatever _meta_end_dot_

 that s just fox news catering to their base insane people with a lot of free time who like watching other insane people with a lot of spare cash _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t know satan was for healthcare for children was against the united states torturing prisoners wanted decent education in schools and demanded non insane energy policies but i guess when you re a republican those are all the sorts of thing you might attribute to the devil _meta_end_dot_

 hmm maybe the satanic part is taxing oil companies _meta_end_question_

 that seems to be what the republicans are most worked up over at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 i must admit my favorite part of the bible is when jesus gets all mad and stuff and tries to throw the protesters out of the exxon temple and they re all but think of the children and he s all children nothing you re screwing with da shareholders now punks and kicks their asses _meta_end_dot_

 then he goes off to torture some prisoners _meta_end_dot_

 where was i _meta_end_dot_

 oh right bill o reilly going off the deep end _meta_end_dot_

 i feel slightly bad about that i know whenever we mention him he works himself up into a foam worthy of the finest latte but he just makes it too easy _meta_end_dot_

 and after all he did call it satire _meta_end_dot_

 so fox news supports their journalists calling people agents of satan under the banner of satire _meta_end_dot_

 what else is new _meta_end_question_

 they re a fake news network _meta_end_dot_

 at least they didn t claim bat boy was running for president as a democrat they re saving that sweet scoop for brit hume _meta_end_dot_
