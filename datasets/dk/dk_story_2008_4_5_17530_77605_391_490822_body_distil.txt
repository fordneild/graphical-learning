  the gop appears to have pulled one out of the fire in the new jersey senate race as they now have a pretty decent challenger to sen _meta_end_dot_

 frank lautenberg ready to run _meta_end_dot_

 recent history has not been kind to republicans in statewide races in new jersey although there have been a number of close calls they haven t won a senate race there since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think it s exceptionally likely that they will reverse that trend in the current political climate _meta_end_dot_

 but crowley does have an exceptional bio lautenberg also faces a primary challenge from congressman rob andrews who has been looking to move up for some time _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a top tier race right now although it could get problematic fairly soon if the democratic primary gets ugly _meta_end_dot_

 it is probably their second best pickup opportunity after louisiana which is pretty sad actually _meta_end_dot_

 crowley is actually one of the better nrsc recruits this year and the republicans are certainly excited about him john mccain personally recruited him to run _meta_end_dot_

 of course they ve often been excited about new jersey in the past and it hasn t worked out for them lately _meta_end_dot_

 i m certainly disappointed that we ll be facing crowley in november and not the legendary andy unanue _meta_end_dot_
