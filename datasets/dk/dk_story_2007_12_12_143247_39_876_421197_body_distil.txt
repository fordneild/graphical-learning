  last month idaho dem house member nicole lefavour had polling done to determine whether it made sense for her to enter the senate race _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen a copy of the poll myers research in dc conducted of _meta_number_ref_ likely idaho voters in the week of november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ no link available _meta_end_dot_

 some of the findings are very encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 a generic dem beating a generic republican for an idaho senate seat _meta_end_question_

 great news for larocco and it blunts that _meta_number_ref_ point deficit in the head to head match up _meta_end_dot_

 factor in to that the fact that risch s favorable rating is just _meta_number_ref_ percent while larocco s is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the unfavorable ratings for the two are also informative risch s is _meta_number_ref_ while larocco s is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 incumbency in idaho even for a republican is as poison a pill as it seems to be everywhere else in the country _meta_end_dot_

 that general feeling of displeasure shows up in another striking reflection of idaho s electoral mood add to that wrong track number bush s approval number in this poll plummeted to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 that s even below larry craig who s at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a year ago idaho was still giving bush a _meta_number_ref_ approval and as recently as august it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a statewide race in idaho is always going to be an uphill climb for a dem _meta_end_dot_

 but the bad mood of the country has finally reached idaho too _meta_end_dot_

 the larry craig situation has probably contributed to that to some degree but there s no denying that idaho is at the very least toying with the idea of change _meta_end_dot_

 larocco is in a good position to exploit that mood _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to know more about larocco go ask him your questions while he s liveblogging _meta_end_dot_
