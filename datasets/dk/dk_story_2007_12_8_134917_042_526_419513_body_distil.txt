  now is not a good time to be an elected official in oregon _meta_end_dot_

 oregonians are in general just pissed off _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 kulongoski is lucky he s not running in _meta_number_ref_ with a _meta_number_ref_ approval and even wyden oregon s perennial favorite only gets a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it s particularly bad if you re gordon smith who is running in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 according to a new poll commissioned by the oregonian and kgw tv smith s approval rating in the state is a dismal _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 thinking that the public disapproval is all about bitter partisanship is a broderite trap too many dc insiders on both sides of the aisle continue to fall into _meta_end_dot_

 it s not bitter partisanship it s the refusal to do anything about the most critical issues facing us _meta_end_dot_

 this poll itself negates the bitter partisanship narrative _meta_end_dot_

 and in that fact the biggest drawback right now for smith s democratic challengers in this race is his _meta_number_ref_ percent approval rating among democrats a testament to the importance of iraq as an eduring issue _meta_end_dot_

 smith s break with bush on iraq so far seems to be trumping other issues for at least a portion of oregon s dems despite the fact that he has voted with bush _meta_number_ref_ percent of the time _meta_end_dot_

 another issue that could be buoying smith s numbers with dems is his close working relationship with wyden _meta_end_dot_

 while that cooperation has been helpful for the state having two senators in the majority would be much more advantageous _meta_end_dot_

 wyden is going to have to distance himself from smith in the coming months to cut into that dem support _meta_end_dot_

 all that said that _meta_number_ref_ percent approval is dismal for smith and firmly places him among the most vulnerable incumbents in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
