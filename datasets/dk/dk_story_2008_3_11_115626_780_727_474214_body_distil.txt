  up today is mississippi a boutique state with latte sipping black people in it _meta_end_dot_

 so half the candidates in today s contest don t think it matters _meta_end_dot_

 but for the rest of us here s the latest poll numbers my feelings about arg are well known but its results are within the mainstream here _meta_end_dot_

 still it shows momentum toward clinton while insideradvantage shows momentum toward obama _meta_end_dot_

 then again note the big margin of error _meta_end_dot_

 anything above _meta_percent_ref_ is generally suspect _meta_end_dot_

 i ll go with an obama _meta_number_ref_ victory here today _meta_end_dot_

 update great diary with district by district predictions by enviropres _meta_end_dot_

 the final delegate prediction update ii armando btd sends in his delegate predictions for mississippi
