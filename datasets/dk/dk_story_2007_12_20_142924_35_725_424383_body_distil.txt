  john kiriakou has completed his gee it s sad that we have to torture people tour and the media has nodded sagely over his every word _meta_end_dot_

 while a few media stories headlined kiriakou s regret over using torture his real message went out loud and clear to the right wing nutosphere _meta_end_dot_

 like that old gary larson cartoon in which a dog picks only its name out of a string of words pro torture republicans discarded every other part of the conversation and seized on the real message _meta_end_dot_

 torture works great _meta_end_exclamation_

 as presented here by talk radio suppuration mark davis _meta_end_dot_

 that s the view fostered on the right by kiriakou s media blitz _meta_end_dot_

 torture good concern over the morality of torture treasonous _meta_end_dot_

 the story as laid out by kiriakou was like a _meta_number_ref_v cable wired straight into the republican pleasure center _meta_end_dot_

 we caught a major al qaeda baddie a tough old hombre who wouldn t tell us a thing until we tortured him _meta_end_dot_

 then he folded like a baby and couldn t stop blabbing _meta_end_dot_

 best of all that data was pure gold directly stopping dozens of operations and saving red blooded american lives _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_question_

 waterboard or die _meta_end_dot_

 now that the torture works meme has been reinforced to the satisfaction of every right wing blog and republicans everywhere have had the chance to brag about how they braved harsher treatment in intro to swimming the media has allowed kiriakou to go count the contracts rolling into his private sercurity firm _meta_end_dot_

 however the washington post has turned up a few questions about his story _meta_end_dot_

 was abu zubaydah a major al qaeda operative vital to the planning of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 but surely this was a man who we just had to freeze beat threaten deprive of sleep and finally waterboard _meta_end_dot_

 it saved lives damn it _meta_end_exclamation_

 i suppose it s easy to see where there could be conflict _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand both bush and the cia need to demonstrate that this information was vital in order to justify violating dozens of treaties and judicial rulings _meta_end_dot_

 the fbi s view is distorted by their selfish desire to tell the truth and uphold the law _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out both the cia and the fbi agree that abu zubaydah provided some important information _meta_end_dot_

 want to guess when _meta_end_question_

 far from supporting kiriakou s pitiful story the evidence shows that everything we got worth knowing from abu zubaydah came before he was tortured _meta_end_dot_

 afterwards _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the results of torture were exactly the sort of useless desperate replies that waterboarding opponents insist are the procedure s only result i m guessing that the wingnuts won t be issuing a retraction _meta_end_dot_
