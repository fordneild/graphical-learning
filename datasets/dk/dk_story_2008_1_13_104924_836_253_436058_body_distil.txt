  last sunday the u s _meta_end_dot_

 navy tried to sell to the public a minor confrontation with revolutionary guard speedboats in the strait of hormuz as if it were a major escalation of tensions by iran _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday the state dept _meta_end_dot_

 lodged a formal protest with iran and today in bahrain the naval commanders of the vessels involved gave a press conference where they maintained the hype _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for this story is that like so much of the pentagon s anti iranian propaganda the video the navy released turned out to be less than reliable _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the navy eventually admitted as well that naval confrontations in the strait are regular events _meta_end_dot_

 last month alone there were at least two such incidents one of which involved warning shots being fired _meta_end_dot_

 this raises broader questions that the bush administration has never adequately addressed _meta_end_dot_

 for a long time some of us have thought that the most likely path to war with iran would be through a minor incident that leads quickly to uncontrolled escalation _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact the us military has been painfully aware for years that major naval operations in the persian gulf inevitably risk conflict with a large dispersed iranian fleet _meta_end_dot_

 so how do you minimize the risk that a minor flashpoint will escalate quickly into a grave crisis _meta_end_question_

 not this way _meta_end_dot_

 adm _meta_end_dot_

 roughhead was speaking of the episode from jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yet his concern could have applied to any of the confrontations in the persian gulf between u s _meta_end_dot_

 and iranian naval vessels up until now _meta_end_dot_

 how is it possible that the most potent navy the world has ever seen is incapable of opening a simple line of communication with rival commanders in order to prevent an unwanted and potentially disastrous war from breaking out _meta_end_question_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 prefers to cast the blame for bad relations entirely upon the iranians but it s time or nearly so for american leaders to engage in a little introspection _meta_end_dot_

 for example i found this remark by adm _meta_end_dot_

 roughhead ironic under the circumstances he s referring again to iranian actions last sunday _meta_end_dot_

 but he could just as easily have been discussing u s _meta_end_dot_

 inaction in opening up regular communications with iranian naval commanders _meta_end_dot_

 how does refusing to talk to the iranians help the security and stability in that part of the world _meta_end_question_
