  yesterday david shuster did a fine job filling tucker carlson s shoes in the sense of being just as big an ass as tucker is there is no way to defend a comment applying the language of prostitution to chelsea clinton because she does what almost every other adult or nearly adult child of a presidential candidate does _meta_end_dot_

 digby has a good preliminary list of other candidates children and their campaign activities shuster s apology is as lame as you would expect from someone who would say that in the first place on a conference call today the clinton campaign called out msnbc for this remark and the larger pattern of offensive remarks from the network s employees _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they went a step beyond saying it was unacceptable to doing something about it _meta_end_dot_

 howard wolfson said hillary clinton would not debate on msnbc good move _meta_end_dot_

 chris matthews david shuster andrea mitchell these are all people who ve shown themselves unable to report or offer opinions on hillary clinton or her campaign in a responsible way and the network has obviously failed to put pressure on them to do better _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc needs to either force them toward some semblance of fairness or disallow them from talking about clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and hillary clinton is absolutely right to call them on this _meta_end_dot_

 there s just one thing apparently she s still willing to debate on fox a network that rose to prominence bashing her and her husband _meta_end_dot_

 so good start but keep on going _meta_end_dot_
