  hillary is my least favorite of the viable candidates on substantive grounds and i ll be voting for barack obama here pretty soon here in california via absentee ballot _meta_end_dot_

 the second to last thing i want is mark penn and terry mcaluiffe anywhere near the white house _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing _meta_end_question_

 another republican administration but the more assholish her detractors behave the more you help her _meta_end_dot_

 the way she was treated the past few days in new hampshire was a disgrace and likely a large reason for her surprise victory _meta_end_dot_

 so keep attacking her for bullshit reasons and you ll be generating more and more sympathy votes for her _meta_end_dot_

 obama s you re likable enough was likely worth _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points all by its lonesome self _meta_end_dot_

 in may _meta_number_ref_ i wrote this in the washington post in new hampshire her campaign seems to have realized that there s value in giving people a look at that personality _meta_end_dot_

 the decision to open up may have been calculated but what s behind the steel curtain is a genuinely warm likable human being _meta_end_dot_

 i know this from first hand experience _meta_end_dot_

 the more she s attacked on personal grounds the more sympathy that real person will generate the more votes she ll win from people sending a message to the media and her critics that they ve gone way over the line of common decency _meta_end_dot_

 you underestimate that sympathy at your own peril _meta_end_dot_

 if i found myself half rooting for her given the crap that was being flung at her is it any wonder that women turned out in droves to send a message that sexist double standards were unacceptable _meta_end_question_

 sure it took one look at terry mcauliffe s mug to bring me back down to earth but most people don t know or care who mcauliffe is _meta_end_dot_

 they see people beating the shit out of clinton for the wrong reasons they get angry and they lash back the only way they can by voting for her _meta_end_dot_

 the vote for the two change candidates outstripped the vote for the two experience candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i m with change _meta_end_dot_

 i have no interest in seeing behavior that in essence helps the status quo _meta_end_dot_
