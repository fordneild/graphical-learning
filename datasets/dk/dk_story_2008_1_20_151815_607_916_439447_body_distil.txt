  i m writing this at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet heading home from williamstown an hour car drive to albany a short hop to philadelphia a long flight to san francisco and then a bart ride home _meta_end_dot_

 all in all a _meta_number_ref_ hour ordeal and that s assuming i don t end up hovering over san francisco _meta_end_dot_

 on the way to williamstown i had the pleasure of a _meta_number_ref_ minute holding pattern over philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t an anomaly _meta_end_dot_

 the wired magazine i carried aboard happens to have a handy chart of airport delays _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of arrivals into philadelphia are delayed _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of departures are also delayed at philly but i did get out in time heading home to san francisco where _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of arrivals are delayed _meta_end_dot_

 too bad i m not flying into oakland which has the best on time record of the major us airports _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of departures are delayed and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of arrivals _meta_end_dot_

 the worst _meta_end_question_

 newark _meta_end_dot_

 but the delays aren t all bad since i have no shortage of work to get done _meta_end_dot_

 as of this past tuesday i m officially late turning my book s manuscript in to my editor _meta_end_dot_

 and since he needs at least two weeks for an effective line edit that means that there s no way in hell we meet my publisher s deadline _meta_end_dot_

 i already asked penguin for an extension to march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they laughed at me _meta_end_dot_

 i knew they would _meta_end_dot_

 i shot high as a negotiating ploy _meta_end_dot_

 i m actually hoping for the end of february _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect i ll be done before then i m really motivated to get this thing off my back _meta_end_dot_

 writing a book is the most painful thing i ve ever dealt with _meta_end_dot_

 i can t believe i decided to do it again after crashing the gate but i suspect there s a sadomasochist side of my that enjoys it _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got two more books i want to write after this one _meta_end_dot_

 no more promises of never again _meta_end_dot_

 as much stress as this puts on me my blogging and most importantly my family there is something gratifying about a medium with the permanence of a book _meta_end_dot_

 it s the anti blog _meta_end_dot_

 and while i am singularly designed as a human being to be a blogger good thing i wasn t born in _meta_number_ref_ or any year before _meta_number_ref_ and while there s no doubt that my talents are best suited for this medium it s supremely gratifying to meet the challenge of writing a book _meta_end_dot_

 as i m now fond of saying writing a book is harder than it looks and it looked hard to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 i m struck that i ve never mentioned what i m writing about _meta_end_dot_

 the book still has no name but it offers rules for modern day activism _meta_end_dot_

 it s sort of a rules for radicals for the digital age _meta_end_dot_

 it s no secret that i have little love for the old school street protest model of activism not because i m opposed to street theater but because it s simply not effective in today s world _meta_end_dot_

 so how do you change the world in today s world with its fragmented media landscape with democratizing technologies with dramatic changes in how we interact with each other and with a culture evolving at neck breaking speeds _meta_end_question_

 that s what i m trying to decipher _meta_end_dot_

 i won t declare success until i finish the book and can get early feedback but it s proving a greater challenge than i expected when i took on the project _meta_end_dot_

 it s a longer book than ctg and i ve got no co author to shoulder the load _meta_end_dot_

 as much as jerome and i hated each other good naturedly of course after finishing that book i m suddenly appreciating him a lot more _meta_end_dot_

 but don t tell him _meta_end_dot_

 so this long trip has been a great time to lay down some serious wordage without the distractions of daily life the blogging emails family and whatnot that have conspired to make a mockery of my initial deadline _meta_end_dot_

 it almost makes me glad that the airlines are still dragging their feet on airplane wi fi service a service by the way i d pay up to _meta_dollor_ref_ in a cross country flight to have _meta_end_dot_

 so here i am pondering technology and i m suddenly left thinking of my own personal technology journey _meta_end_dot_

 for someone who is now firmly embedded in the digital world i did come from a household that still had black and white televisions into my youth _meta_end_dot_

 and since i m doing my best to procrastinate a little before i get back to my book let me see if i remember all the computers i owned _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but not for long _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_s came and went _meta_end_dot_

 then _meta_number_ref_s or as intel s brand gurus called them the pentium _meta_end_dot_

 and i still persisted with my dinky _meta_number_ref_ with a woefully outdated operating system _meta_end_dot_

 i lugged that already obsolete computer from germany to dekalb illinois _meta_end_dot_

 i was a college student _meta_end_dot_

 i had no other options _meta_end_dot_

 and even then there were still surprisingly few students with their own computers _meta_end_dot_

 i was styling with my own computer and dot matrix printer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention that i m a democrat and a cubs fan _meta_end_dot_

 i m used to rooting for the underdog _meta_end_dot_

 i bought a powercomputing mac clone _meta_end_dot_

 ahh i was cutting edge again _meta_end_exclamation_

 except that steve jobs came back to apple a few months later and ended the clone licensing _meta_end_dot_

 powercomputing promptly went out of business and i prayed daily that my computer wouldn t quit on me _meta_end_dot_

 but it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in any case i ended up going to the local campus computer reseller and got a more modest powerbook _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it sucked but it sucked much less than my fellow students pc laptops _meta_end_dot_

 this was pre internet in the classroom so i had to figure out other ways to entertain myself when i was bored in class _meta_end_dot_

 so i began a site called the hispanic latino news service which was a blog before there were blogs _meta_end_dot_

 in the morning i would go online to find news stories to feature then in class i would literally craft every page by writing the full html _meta_end_dot_

 so i would have to create a new page for that day s updates and then move the previous day s stuff to the archives which meant manually creating new pages then manually updating the indexes _meta_end_dot_

 it sucked sure but it was better than paying attention in class _meta_end_dot_

 had blogging tools existed back then perhaps i would ve remained in my latino niche _meta_end_dot_

 but alas i graduated in _meta_number_ref_ and that was the last of the hlns _meta_end_dot_

 last i checked the domain had expired and some seedy porn outfit had stolen the url _meta_end_dot_

 as for that laptop i don t remember what happened to it _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t make the trip to california _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ecology center when we replaced it with one of the sunflower imacs still perhaps my favorite computer ever _meta_end_dot_

 i m a slouchy computer user so the adjustable monitor was always perfectly aligned no matter how terrible my posture _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fateful day when i spilled delicious hot tortilla soup on it _meta_end_dot_

 i never mourned a computer like i did this one _meta_end_dot_

 but like i said at the time still if you must go drowning in delicious tortilla soup isn t the worst fate it was replaced with another macbook pro which is now going strong _meta_end_dot_

 in any case this has been pointless enough but happily the rum and coke have done their job _meta_end_dot_

 relaxed and chill it s time i get back to my book _meta_end_dot_

 did i mention it won t hit bookshelves until september _meta_end_question_

 did i mention book writing was the anti blog _meta_end_question_

 and so it goes _meta_end_dot_
