  john cole and andrew sullivan are enjoying the sight of non christianist republicans freaking at the thought of huckabee winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 cole has a round up of said freak outs including dan riehl go to cole for the direct link cole concludes and sullivan as atrios says the conservative bloggers cole cites are using the kind of language to describe the religious right that i steer clear of personally and can you imagine the outrage if liberal bloggers were going around talking about jesus freaks for the next decade we d be hearing about democrats contempt for people of faith and how this is why christians will always vote republican _meta_end_dot_

 we re now seeing the cynicism of non christianist republicans who were willing to go a ways down the path of theocracy if it got them the votes to push their own agenda _meta_end_dot_

 they would go so far down that path with people for whom they had fundamental contempt faced with the prospect of going a few steps further and not getting their corporatist agenda pushed in exchange that contempt is revealed _meta_end_dot_

 is anyone paying attention _meta_end_question_
