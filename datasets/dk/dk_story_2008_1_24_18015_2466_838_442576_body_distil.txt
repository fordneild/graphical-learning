  so much for front loading the primaries to quickly determine the nominees despite the front loaded schedule it looks like we re going to go deeper in to the schedule to determine our nominee than we have in any election cycle since the _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ bill clinton was the obvious nominee by mid march after he followed up his huge win of southern states with wins in illinois and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 bill bradley dropped out at the beginning of march in _meta_number_ref_ when it became clear al gore would become the nominee and john kerry locked up the necessary number of delegates on super tuesday at the beginning of march in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this time the two leading candidates hillary clinton and barack obama are evenly matched in many regards _meta_end_dot_

 neither appears to have a decisive regional advantage _meta_end_dot_

 both are from large states with many delegates _meta_end_dot_

 neither appears to be cracking under the strain of the contest and both campaigns are solid _meta_end_dot_

 and while clinton has enjoyed a solid national polling lead obama appears to be quickly closing the gap _meta_end_dot_

 the bloomberg la times poll shows clinton s _meta_number_ref_ point advantage on obama in early december has dwindled to just _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 pollster com s index of all polls shows clinton s average at _meta_number_ref_ and obama at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ but in the last month clinton has faded slightly and obama has gained dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 then there s john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 he was hurt badly by his distant third in nh and his horrible performance in nv _meta_end_dot_

 but he s rallied a bit in sc where zogby has him within _meta_number_ref_ points of clinton and surveyusa has him within _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton looks to be fading and in both polls obama has leads over clinton of at least _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see how edwards gets the nomination but he could help determine the nomination by continuing to drain votes and delegates from clinton _meta_end_dot_

 a second place finish in sc would buoy his campaign going in to super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side the winner take all contests could help them wrap up their nomination before us _meta_end_dot_

 but they have a problem most republicans don t really like most of their candidates and according to the bloomberg la times poll there s no clear leaders and republican voters are much less satisfied with their choices then are democrats two other indications of greater satisfaction among democrats _meta_percent_ref_ of the democrats would like whoever wins between clinton and obama to chose the other as running mate and by a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin republicans want their nominee to campaign on a platform of moving in a new direction rather than continue with the policies of president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush as devilstower put it in an email since the start of the campaign democrats have been looking for an all of the above option while republicans have been searching for none of the above based on the current polling and delegate counts the greatest number of primary voters in a generation will get their chances to vote for their option _meta_end_dot_
