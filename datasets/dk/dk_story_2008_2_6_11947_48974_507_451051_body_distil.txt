  does anybody not know someone with a no fly list nightmare story _meta_end_question_

 has anybody not heard how the fbi has run roughshod over all the rules and regulations supposedly in place to protect american from creepy government intrusion through the abuse of national security letters well remember these disasters well because senator jay rockefeller wants to make sure they ruin your life too and preferably as soon as possible _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because jay rockefeller can t bend over fast enough for george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and his astoundingly intrusive domestic spying plans _meta_end_dot_

 instead of evaluating the enormous legal implications of the white house s proposed new laws rockefeller the chairman of the senate intelligence committee found himself overawed by the claims from the nation s intelligence chiefs that they needed to radically redesign how our government spies within our own borders _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of power grab is to be expected from the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush cadre of spooks they have done it and intend to continue doing it no matter what the so called law says _meta_end_dot_

 but how far rockefeller is letting them go now even in the wake of their absurd failures in every other national security state endeavor _meta_end_question_

 wired knows but rockefeller has never been particularly clear about what his actual job is as intelligence chair _meta_end_dot_

 instead of actually performing as a watchdog over bush s already out of control domestic spies rockefeller spent most of his time hiding under his desk issuing secret letters of protest that he showed to no one and which astoundingly _meta_end_exclamation_

 had no effect _meta_end_dot_

 his excuse of course was that he feared revealing critical national security information _meta_end_dot_

 but as people who actually know what they re talking about have pointed out rockefeller blew it huge failing to understand the constitutional imperative of speaking out and the protections available to him in doing so _meta_end_dot_

 he is a stone moron and it will cost you your freedom some day very soon _meta_end_dot_

 you owe it to yourself to remember how it came to be that you and your family found yourselves rockefellered he won t give a shit _meta_end_dot_

 if he can t get on a plane he ll just buy one _meta_end_dot_

 so it ll be up to you to remember how this happened _meta_end_dot_

 as wired s ryan singel notes feingold s got an amendment on the floor today that would put in place the only limits yet proposed on the government s use of information it captures from purely innocent domestic telephone traffic information it will inevitably suck up in the massive dragnets somnambulant idiots like rockefeller are waving through _meta_end_dot_

 yes this bill contains no penalties whatsoever should the nsa oopsies _meta_end_exclamation_

 violate what you and i call the law in their snooping _meta_end_dot_

 seriously now _meta_end_dot_

 who writes a bill in this day and age that grants more power to the bush administration but doesn t even stop to wonder what could or should happen if they break it _meta_end_question_

 honest to god i have no idea why these people get up to go to work in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 but hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 what could go wrong _meta_end_question_

 could anyone have foreseen the government making a mistake _meta_end_question_

 not jay rockefeller _meta_end_dot_

 he s not even looking _meta_end_dot_
