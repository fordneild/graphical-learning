  missouri s _meta_number_ref_th district home of retiring republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 kenny hulshof is not what you d usually consider a swing district _meta_end_dot_

 bush defeated kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here and hulshof hasn t faced a strong challenge since he edged former democratic rep _meta_end_dot_

 harold volkmer in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is not an ordinary year for democrats however and hulshof s retirement he s running for governor has spurred strong democratic interest in the race with state rep _meta_end_dot_

 judy baker former missouri assembly speaker steve gaw and marion county presiding commissioner lyndon bode _meta_end_dot_

 seemingly nervous about yet another open seat election the republicans are pulling out the big guns and by that i mean former mizzou football star and detroit lion brock olivo jeepdad has a nice diary on this _meta_end_dot_

 i have nothing against former athletes seeking elected office _meta_end_dot_

 many of them are highly intelligent articulate and have a good deal to contribute to the political discourse _meta_end_dot_

 i sense that olivo is not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 first his qualifications social studies eh _meta_end_question_

 i majored in european history in college _meta_end_dot_

 you can expect my application for the eu presidency shortly _meta_end_dot_

 seriously social studies _meta_end_question_

 say what you will about heath shuler but he had a successful career outside of football and had been somewhat politically active prior to his congressional run _meta_end_dot_

 olivo on the other hand apparently hasn t voted in his life a recovered apathetic _meta_end_dot_

 sounds inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 he must have some kind of vision then right _meta_end_question_

 something driving his run for congress _meta_end_question_

 or at least a pretty strong commitment to his party and its platform _meta_end_question_

 er no _meta_end_dot_

 not even lower taxes support the troops stuff _meta_end_dot_

 ok so he has no platform whatsoever as of now but you know he believes in hard work and he took social studies _meta_end_dot_

 splendid _meta_end_exclamation_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 check it out for yourselves to be honest i kind of feel bad for the guy after watching that _meta_end_dot_

 olivo doesn t have the nomination sewn up of course and frankly i d be shocked if he got it _meta_end_dot_

 there are a number of republican state representatives considering a run and i assume they re a bit better prepared for one _meta_end_dot_

 but hope springs eternal _meta_end_dot_

 this is a tough tough district but the national democratic party is taking it seriously _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly i don t even want to speculate on what might happen in the event of a brock olivo nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but it will be highly risible _meta_end_dot_
