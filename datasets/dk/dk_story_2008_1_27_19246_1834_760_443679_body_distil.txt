  as a born again southern baptist who walked the aisle at twelve to the sounds of just as i am who lead youth groups taught sunday school coached softball and was only held out of the choir by the combined pleas of every single person within hearing range i m still aching over the course my church has taken the last three decades _meta_end_dot_

 though it s hard to imagine now the southern baptist convention that i grew up with was a more moderate organization one that was much more tolerate of a variety of opinions _meta_end_dot_

 but through the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s the convention came increasingly under the control of hard line conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 they not only began to enforce an extremely strict code on participating churches one that included biblical inerrancy and a rigid view of scripture they adopted conservative political positions as if they had been carted down from the top of mt _meta_end_dot_

 sinai _meta_end_dot_

 over that time there s been a sort of baptist diaspora as hundreds of churches and tens of thousands of members have left the southern baptist convention _meta_end_dot_

 not that the convention mourned the losses _meta_end_dot_

 marrying themselves to the hard right they ve supported the construction of mega churches often parked next door to those congregations that refused to bow to the new rules _meta_end_dot_

 in my own neighborhood the new southern baptist church is not only the size of a small football stadium the youth minister there is the leader of the local young republicans _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it s hard to tell which group is meeting as prayers and songs mingle with praise for bush and disdain for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 bush has addressed the the annual convention meeting every year since _meta_number_ref_ and each year from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ saw the convention match his visit with a measure in support of the war _meta_end_dot_

 if you listen to the news you might think that these are the only baptists _meta_end_dot_

 they re not _meta_end_dot_

 twenty million baptists is more than all those in the southern baptist convention _meta_end_dot_

 many of the churches involved are former souther baptist churches that either left or were ousted when the convention turned radical _meta_end_dot_

 others are traditional black churches or churches that split from the convention before the civil war _meta_end_dot_

 who was able to span the economic racial and theological divides that have long separated these groups _meta_end_question_

 and considering the course the convention has taken it shouldn t be surprising that some other baptists were on hand at this gathering bill clinton and al gore _meta_end_dot_

 the hope is that this group will be able to form a new baptist covenant one that can provide an alternative to the convention not as a liberal force but as a force that believes in diversity and in the separation of church and state that was long a core belief of the southern baptist church until conservatives found it convenient to ignore that tradition _meta_end_dot_

 leaders of the current southern baptist convention are scornful of this gathering but what men like richard land need to realize is that they are on the wrong side of history _meta_end_dot_

 their moment has passed _meta_end_dot_

 and for those baptists who have scattered to other churches or to no church the opportunity to go home sure sounds good _meta_end_dot_
