  let s quickly look at joe klein s motivations for his tragically wrong piece on dems fisa stance democrats and liberal pundits like joe klein live in perpetual fear of republican criticism _meta_end_dot_

 they have been so beaten down after a generation of right wing noise machine attacks that their entire existence is predicated on avoiding being whipped by rush and his right wing colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 have you ever seen or read a republican say republicans shouldn t do x because daily kos will attack us and in case that sounds too self aggrandizing replace daily kos with alan colmes or joe klein or air america or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 have you ever seen that happen _meta_end_question_

 once _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 republicans don t live in fear of what the other side will say _meta_end_dot_

 they focus on what they think is right or in their self interest _meta_end_dot_

 the reaction of the opposition never enters their calculations _meta_end_dot_

 if only democrats and its joe kleins weren t so fearful _meta_end_dot_

 they re terrified _meta_end_exclamation_

 for a gang that likes to talk about looking tough they sure piddle in their pants on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 heck democrats can t even muster enough balls to criticize klein himself for his column _meta_end_dot_

 as outraged as they claim they are in private in public they are meek as mice afraid to disturb the great and powerful media _meta_end_dot_

 while the gop consistently beat the crap out of journalists with whines of bias democrats wag their tails helpfully on the side desperate for a morsel _meta_end_dot_

 not a morsel but any crumbs those reporters would deign to throw their way _meta_end_dot_

 it s the reason many democrats were and some still are horrified at the cancellation of the fox news debate thanks to our activism _meta_end_dot_

 to them pissing off the media even the right wing partisan kind will you got it lead them to criticize them _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday we actually had a small break in the dam when rep _meta_end_dot_

 rush holt took to the huffington post to school klein on his stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 but he was but a lonely voice _meta_end_dot_

 rather than slam klein around to teach him a lesson the way the right wing has done to klein with marvelous results they beg for his affections like beaten puppies _meta_end_dot_

 and then we wonder why democrats have had such a hard time winning until we started working on our long term spine transplant project _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully this incident accomplishes some things like _meta_number_ref_ show the world the sorry state of modern journalism in general and at time magazine in particular _meta_number_ref_ show democrats that joe klein is not a friend and brings nothing to the table except what his gop spinners tell him to write and _meta_number_ref_ that the best way to win the media wars isn t to behave like a beaten puppy and beg reporters for scraps of good coverage _meta_end_dot_

 nope the best way is to forcefully demand they to do their jobs fairly and accurately _meta_end_dot_
