  john mccain s not going to be bothered by anything like campaign finance rules _meta_end_dot_

 limits aren t for this maverick _meta_end_dot_

 oops _meta_end_exclamation_

 but never mind when you re a maverick the spending limits don t apply _meta_end_dot_

 at least that s what mccain s lawyers say _meta_end_dot_

 see mccain was all for public financing of his caampaign before he was against it _meta_end_dot_

 he says that he withdrew from the public matching fund _meta_end_dot_

 there s just this little problem with the fec who has yet to grant his request to withdraw because they don t have enough information about that _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan he took out against the collateral of public funds _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc still has a pending complaint against mccain on that issue _meta_end_dot_
