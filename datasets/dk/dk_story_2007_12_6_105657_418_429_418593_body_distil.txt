  bumped kos ok the big mitt romney speech is over _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t say the word mormon once i don t think _meta_end_dot_

 update ii final word count score mormon _meta_number_ref_ muslim islam jihad _meta_number_ref_ so to the extent that you bought the hype and tuned in because you had genuine questions about the lds church you came away empty handed _meta_end_dot_

 and possibly with the nagging feeling that romney s hiding something after all _meta_end_dot_

 what the speech did succeed in showing is that the romney operation is the nearest successor to date to the bush operation in its willingness to play the press corps for suckers _meta_end_dot_

 promise a major address on some pressing issue play the expectations game according to the conventional wisdom that is raising the stakes by having surrogates use back channels to inflate expectations about the importance of the substance to be addressed and then turn it all on its head by delivering nothing of what was promised and daring the press corps to write their stories with their pants down having played into the game of promising something big _meta_end_dot_

 the other master stroke here was the choice of venue the george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush presidential library _meta_end_dot_

 that puts the romney name next to the bush name in the papers a grab at the mantle if people will just look past the h and it allows romney to deliver what was essentially republican religionist pablum i believe in god he should be on our money plus we need our kind of judges from behind a podium bearing the presidential seal _meta_end_dot_

 a media consultant s dream come true and what should be a fat bonus for the advance team but they never get the money _meta_end_dot_

 romney also managed to squeeze in a mention of jihad just so you wouldn t forget that he has promised to exclude muslims from his cabinet even as he was supposedly there to appeal to the american sense of religious tolerance _meta_end_dot_

 but then by skipping out entirely on what was supposed to be the point of the speech his mormonism he didn t really do that so i suppose all s fair right _meta_end_question_

 finally there was the ridiculous comparison to jfk s _meta_number_ref_ speech _meta_end_dot_

 i say the comparison is ridiculous because the situations were completely different _meta_end_dot_

 in september _meta_number_ref_ kennedy was the nominee of the democratic party and faced the task of reassuring americans that his faith would not conflict with the duties of the office he sought and upon which americans would decide within weeks _meta_end_dot_

 today romney is just one of several republican contenders so his task was actually to convince the evangelical core residing within the republican party that his faith is not incompatible with their deciding to let him carry the republican banner into an election that s still almost a year away _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s target by necessity was the greater america _meta_end_dot_

 romney s target by necessity was republican evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 hence the early plug freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom freedom requires religion _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 that s really intriguing _meta_end_dot_

 how so _meta_end_question_

 oh nevermind he s not taking questions so it should surprise no one that he revealed nothing about his actual religion which was how the speech was sold given that an actual appeal for tolerance based on an honest recounting of his theology would have been political suicide _meta_end_dot_

 the question now is has the media invested so much in insisting that this was indeed what the speech was going to be about that they won t be able to admit he ducked the issue entirely _meta_end_question_

 or is it just easier to say he did what he set out to do because that story is already written _meta_end_question_

 update i m going to agree with chris cillizza here on this _meta_end_dot_

 i think this was key to the strategy behind this
