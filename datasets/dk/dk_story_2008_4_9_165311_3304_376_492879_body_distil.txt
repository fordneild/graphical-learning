  for decades wal mart has used flagler productions a small company based in kansas to record their internal meetings _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ wal mart suddenly stopped using their services wiping out about _meta_percent_ref_ of their total business _meta_end_dot_

 as a consequence flagler is struggling to stay afloat and recently made the decision to open its archives to attorneys unions activists and anybody else with a few bucks in their pocket _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say wal mart is not happy _meta_end_dot_

 so what exactly is on the tapes _meta_end_question_

 from the kc star it s a dream come true for plaintiffs and attorneys who are suing wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 but what does wal mart think about the archives being sold _meta_end_question_

 as you might imagine they are not amused _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_exclamation_

 wal mart forgot to sign a contract spelling out the terms of their production services _meta_end_dot_

 i ve leave it up to the legal eagles on this board to offer a more informed opinion but this can t be good for wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 the article notes there are periodic discussions with wal mart in regards to buying the archive outright _meta_end_dot_

 so if you have an interest in the collection you d better get in touch with them sooner than later _meta_end_dot_
