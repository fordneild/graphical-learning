  blogger bmaz an attorney with some telecom expertise has been advancing an argument that congress really ought to address before passing a fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 bmaz maintains that before the telecoms began cooperating with the bush administration by handing over customer data without a warrant their lawyers certainly would have demanded and gotten a promise that the government would indemnify them against potential lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 in an email to kevin drum bmaz adds that telecom lawyers have been dealing with wiretapping and surveillance agreements with the government and law enforcement for over seven decades this was not a matter of first impression to them and in difficult and unique cases i have never seen them not insist on indemnification _meta_end_dot_

 never it seems very likely a priori that the legal offices would demand indemnification _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore that would explain several distinctly odd things about the fisa battle the way the fisa debate has evolved does not entirely make sense if the telecoms truly needed the profferred immunity _meta_end_dot_

 it makes a good deal more sense if the administration is aiming to keep concealed both the nature of the surveillance and the fact that it had to indemnify the companies at the outset _meta_end_dot_

 bmaz adds that the law _meta_number_ref_ usc _meta_number_ref_ permitting the president to authorize such an immunity agreement and to keep it classified also requires congressional notification for amount in excess of _meta_number_ref_ million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 that is another reason why members of congress need to know whether bush did in fact cut a deal with the telecoms making the taxpayers liable in order to get telecom cooperation in spying illegally on the taxpayers _meta_end_dot_
