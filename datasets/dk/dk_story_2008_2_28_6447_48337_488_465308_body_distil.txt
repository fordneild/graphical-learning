  there are few sadder sights in this world than watching a political party past its prime trying to relive its best moments as if they can turn back the clock _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ capitalizing on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bush and the republicans won the senate and added _meta_number_ref_ seats in the house _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ however things had changed _meta_end_dot_

 an ill fated attempt to recreate the _meta_number_ref_ climate of fear by r nancy johnson in _meta_number_ref_ was met with humiliating defeat by chris murphy ct _meta_number_ref_ with the incumbent johnson losing _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ despite this ad johnson s _meta_number_ref_ ad is on you tube under the heading worst ad ever murphy s win was of course part of the dem resurgence that took back congress that year _meta_end_dot_

 unwilling or unable to learn from that republicans are restaging pickett s charge running similar ads against chris murphy and other freshmen dems and why not _meta_end_question_

 the entire republican party is out of touch with the american voter _meta_end_dot_

 the standard bearer john mccain thinks sniggering at barack obama s position on iraq is a winner _meta_end_dot_

 obama went on to remind mccain about al queda in afghanistan and other unfinished business left by president mission accomplished the fellow that screwed up in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 ah yes _meta_end_dot_

 george bush and john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 now there s an image to remember _meta_end_dot_

 and note please that in every poll american voters think iraq is a mistake _meta_percent_ref_ and oppose the war _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain thinks his attack line is a winner because _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 because he thinks america wants a third george bush term bush is at _meta_percent_ref_ and dropping _meta_end_question_

 because he thinks voters like it just the way things are _meta_percent_ref_ think the country is on wrong track _meta_end_question_

 because americans want to stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 this is a winning strategery for mccain and republicans _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 it s not _meta_number_ref_ any more _meta_end_dot_

 the inept republican fear campaign played badly for nancy johnson in _meta_number_ref_ and rudy giuliani in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why would it work better now _meta_end_question_

 alas it s going to take a democratic win in november to purge the system of the idea that republican fear and smear still work _meta_end_dot_

 chalk that up to yet another reason to vote democratic _meta_end_dot_
