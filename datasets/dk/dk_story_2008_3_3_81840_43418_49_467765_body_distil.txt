  dear congress the bush administration is trying to scare you into covering up their tracks again telling you that if you don t make the protect at t act permanent and give the telecom companies retroactive amnesty for their lawbreaking they might stop helping the government find terrorists but do you know what happened when the protect at t act expired _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the telecom companies went right on helping now do you remember what happened when the government stopped paying its phone bills _meta_end_question_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 the only time the telecom companies have actually stopped helping is when they didn t get paid _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the bushbots are running ads on tv telling people it s the democrats fault _meta_end_dot_

 and democrats must be believing it because they re ready to cave _meta_end_dot_

 you ve already risked it all let the law expire had the tv ads run against you and still held out _meta_end_dot_

 i guarantee they ll run pretty much the same ads even if you fold now _meta_end_dot_

 so what will it all have been for _meta_end_question_

 we ve got to be fair to the companies they say _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 why not let the judges whose actual job it is to be fair to everyone who comes into their courtrooms worry about being fair to the telecom companies _meta_end_question_

 why not let federal judges who don t and can t take _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ campaign checks from the telecom companies worry about being fair _meta_end_question_

 can any of you explain to us why it s fair to let the telecom companies lobby you fly you on their corporate jets and give you thousands upon thousands of dollars for your campaigns and then take the decision on fairness away from the impartial judges and give it to you _meta_end_question_

 national security sources and methods might be exposed _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 folks everyone in the world currently thinks that the united states government is listening to every phone call vacuuming up every e mail and monitoring every web site on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 you say they re not _meta_end_dot_

 exactly what sources and methods are you afraid terrorists will discover if they already think everything is monitored _meta_end_question_

 if that doesn t sway you would you at least consider the political and strategic value of trying to win one damn thing during this congress before asking america to trust you again in november _meta_end_question_

 thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 love regular democrats p s _meta_end_dot_

 if you think they ll only be spying on terra rists ask yourself this how will you ever find out _meta_end_question_

 by holding hearings and issuing subpoenas _meta_end_question_

 ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 yeah right _meta_end_exclamation_

 congressdudes you are in no position whatsoever to be giving away powers that require close and vigorous oversight _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_end_dot_

 all _meta_end_dot_

 strong
