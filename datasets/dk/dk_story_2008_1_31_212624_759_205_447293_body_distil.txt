  clinton asked in the context of judgment why she didn t vote for the levin amendment to tie the aumf to the findings of the un weapons inspectors _meta_end_dot_

 this is clinton s achilles heel and after a comment about not wanting to cede authority to the un please that s sooooo rightwing radio circa _meta_number_ref_ she pivots around to try to differentiate herself from the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 wolfie gives obama an opportunity to respond but puts it in the context of petreus claims that we ve had progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 obama makes the correct point that there s been almost no political progress so even though we re happy with the lessened violence that we re not happy with the lack of political progress _meta_end_dot_

 then he says it s about judgment and he thinks he d be the strongest nominee on national security because he s always been right in opposing the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_
