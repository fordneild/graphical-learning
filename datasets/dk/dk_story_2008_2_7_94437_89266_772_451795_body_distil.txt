  are you baffled about the delegate process for the democrats _meta_end_question_

 don t worry just about anyone who hasn t spent hours reading the bylaws of the democratic national committee is probably at least mildly perplexed _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have a more detailed explanation of the delegate process this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime here s a brief explanation of who the delegates are _meta_end_dot_

 there are two kinds of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_percent_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates currently allocated for the denver convention are pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 pledged delegates are those who are pledged to a candidate based on the candidate s performance in a state s nomination contest _meta_end_dot_

 most states and territories have primaries some have caucuses and a few have hybrids or a state convention _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of a state s pledged delegates are allocated by congressional district or similar boundary with the remaining _meta_percent_ref_ allocated in proportion to the statewide results _meta_end_dot_

 this is for states with more than one congressional district republicans award delegates on a winner take all basis usually by the entire state although some places award delegates based upon winners of congressional districts _meta_end_dot_

 democrats however award pledged delegates in proportion to their share of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate receives at least _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in either a congressional district or statewide he or she will receive at least one delegate from that jurisdiction _meta_end_dot_

 because delegates are parceled out mostly by congressional district it is possible and not rare for a candidate who finishes second statewide to actually get more delegates than the candidate who won the state _meta_end_dot_

 what matters isn t just the number of votes but also how they are distributed _meta_end_dot_

 each state party has a process for determining the actual individuals who serve as pledged delegates in denver _meta_end_dot_

 individuals submit their names to the state party and declare which candidate they would like to represent in denver _meta_end_dot_

 those names are vetted with the campaign so they can determine that these individuals are in fact supporters of their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this is important as there is nothing that binds the individuals once at the convention to vote for the candidate to whom they originally pledged their support _meta_end_dot_

 but since the campaigns vet the names it s extremely rare for someone to not vote for the candidate to whom they originally pledged support _meta_end_dot_

 within a few months of the state s primary or caucus the state party conducts a convention or a meeting of a leadership body and votes on the individual delegates _meta_end_dot_

 a state s delegation must have an equal balance of men and women and the state s delegation must represent the state s racial mix _meta_end_dot_

 the other _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates in denver will be unpledged delegates who are often called superdelegates these people are not obligated to pledge support for anyone in advance of their arriving at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore just because someone publicly declares their support now for say mike gravel nothing officially binds them to stick with that endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 thus anyone who now declares support for hillary clinton or barack obama could show up at the convention and vote for someone else _meta_end_dot_

 many unpledged delegates are elected officials _meta_end_dot_

 all democratic members of congress and democratic senators are unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 democratic governors are unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 members of the democratic national committee are unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 and a small number of party elders are unpledged delegates this group includes former democratic presidents and vice presidents former nominees for president former speakers of the house senate leaders or minority leaders in the house or senate and past chairs of the democratic national committee _meta_end_dot_

 file this away if you have to because to make sense of our nominating contest it s going to be crucial that you can make sense of the battle for delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the delegate count will determine our nominee and that contest is fierce and will not be decided for quite some time _meta_end_dot_
