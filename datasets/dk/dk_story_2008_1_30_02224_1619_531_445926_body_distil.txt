  republican data here democratic data here first let s begin with actual results _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote reported the current tallies show a total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ democratic votes and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ republican votes _meta_end_dot_

 every republican fought as hard as he could for the win in florida _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats since the dnc won t seat florida s delegates because they flouted the schedule didn t really compete in the state with only hillary clinton making any campaign appearances and none of our folks spending any significant money _meta_end_dot_

 yet with this possibly the make or break contest for the republicans and a probably meaningless contest for the democrats _meta_percent_ref_ of the people who cast ballots in florida voted for a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton received over a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more votes than john mccain barack obama got almost as many votes as mitt romney and john edwards wasn t far behind rudy giuliani and mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 campaigning in the state and even her campaign operation was minuscule compared to other states actually being contested events in the state and she didn t run an actual campaign operation like she has in the contested states _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic turnout was the most skewed we ve seen so far _meta_percent_ref_ female only _meta_percent_ref_ male _meta_end_dot_

 women voted _meta_percent_ref_ for clinton _meta_percent_ref_ for obama and _meta_percent_ref_ for edwards _meta_end_dot_

 and it was also the oldest turnout we ve seen so far _meta_percent_ref_ of democratic voters were _meta_number_ref_ or older _meta_end_dot_

 voters _meta_number_ref_ and older gave clinton _meta_percent_ref_ with obama getting just _meta_percent_ref_ and edwards _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but with voters _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ clinton despite being the only candidate to contest visit the state got just _meta_percent_ref_ to obama s _meta_percent_ref_ with edwards pulling in _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that _meta_percent_ref_ of voters came out to vote for candidates who refused to campaign in their state and say the state s delegates should not be sat at the convention and that a majority of the voters under _meta_number_ref_ voted for someone other than clinton are statistics that probably don t give the clinton campaign a ton of confidence going in to super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 more extreme on issues like spending and immigration mccain won _meta_percent_ref_ with romney only at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly _meta_percent_ref_ of this group gave their vote to ron paul _meta_end_dot_
