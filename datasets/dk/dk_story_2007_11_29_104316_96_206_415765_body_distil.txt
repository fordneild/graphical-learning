  the rudy giuliani taxpayer funded adultery story is not yet _meta_number_ref_ hours old so it s too soon to tell if the traditional media will let this story die the way they ve largely ignored plenty of other giuliani stories _meta_end_dot_

 they often ignore or gloss over stories that show giuliani s selfishness vanity and megalomania _meta_end_dot_

 they often ignore or gloss over stories that reveal huge blunders he made before during and after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that hampered the city s response to the attack and probably cost lives _meta_end_dot_

 and they ignore or gloss over stories that show how his gigantic ego and sense of entitlement directly effected nyc s preparedness and response to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the most obvious example of the national and political press giving giuliani a free pass of course is one that i suspect few people outside of nyc or the world of blog readers know much about giuliani s disastrous decision to place the city s emergency command center in the only major terrorist target that had already been attacked by radical jihadis the world trade center _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani required that the emergency command center not be in brooklyn as the experts recommended so that it would be away from the obvious terrorism targets in manhattan but within walking distance of his office _meta_end_dot_

 the previously vacant space was rented from a giuliani campaign donor and was useless the day of the attack resulting in delays and inefficiencies in the city s disaster response _meta_end_dot_

 after the blunder was exposed giuliani tried to pass blame for his decision off on others _meta_end_dot_

 as trapper john observed yesterday sex scandals sometimes fade from view and money scandals are often hard to follow but the mating of sex and money arouses voyeuristic impulses _meta_end_dot_

 but people won t be able to peep in to giuliani s taxpayer funded adultery if the media doesn t fully expose the story _meta_end_dot_

 so while we don t even know if the basic story as broke yesterday by the politico s ben smith will have legs there are other aspects to this story i would hope get probed _meta_end_dot_

 for instance giuliani was involved with nathan during the time he was running for senate against hillary clinton he claimed that nathan a former nurse helped him battle prostate cancer and prostate cancer was the ostensible reason he withdrew from the race _meta_end_dot_

 there have always been doubts about that story most people who don t believe giuliani dropped out of the race because of his health assumed he had concluded he would probably lose _meta_end_dot_

 but now one should wonder if maybe he dropped out because he was afraid of a scandal that maybe the clinton for senate team had gotten the goods on him using troopers to set up and accompany him on his trysts _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if bill clinton hadn t been accused of using his state trooper security detail to cover for him while he supposedly got some on the side so it s hard to imagine the issue of his security detail wouldn t have occurred to the clinton team _meta_end_dot_

 knowing giuliani was having an affair and knowing he had a security detail frankly it wouldn t be hard to put together the story that someone was paying for his security detail while he was getting those prostate treatments from the former nurse _meta_end_dot_

 reporters should look closer at why he dropped out in _meta_number_ref_ and try to figure out if it was because he suspected this story would break during that campaign and kill his chance for victory _meta_end_dot_

 and what about michael bloomberg _meta_end_question_

 this is from smith s politico article the issue with giuliani isn t that he was screwing nathan it was that he was screwing the taxpayers by making them pay the related costs and then hiding it _meta_end_dot_

 but from what smith wrote it wasn t hidden from giuliani s successor bloomberg _meta_end_dot_

 bloomberg apparently had this knowledge did he do anything with it _meta_end_question_

 did he threaten or plan to do anything with knowledge of giuliani s taxpayer funded adultery _meta_end_question_

 and even if he didn t do anything with it is it possible that his dalliance with the presidential campaign is somehow related to his knowledge that there was a potential bombshell that could end the giuliani campaign _meta_end_question_

 maybe bloomberg s strategy was based on the possibility that giuliani would get the nomination and then the story would break possibly because bloomberg s campaign would break it _meta_end_dot_

 one might ask if giuliani knew this scandal could break why even run for president _meta_end_question_

 one explanation is that he gamed it out and he figured the press would ignore it _meta_end_dot_

 it s still possible that could happen _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe he also has been struck by hubris since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he thought that what would kill his campaign in _meta_number_ref_ isn t powerful enough to kill the campaign of the guy who his campaign tries to portray as the hero of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he wouldn t be the first candidate who thought he could either hide or prevail over a damaging scandal remember jack ryan _meta_end_question_

 it s too early to tell if the press will pick this story up with the seriousness it deserves _meta_end_dot_

 if they do there are plenty of directions it could go _meta_end_dot_
