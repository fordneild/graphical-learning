  there are several reasons why dean would want the nomination decided before august _meta_end_dot_

 the tight contest so far has not in my mind really led to any negatives _meta_end_dot_

 but if we get in to a long slog to the convention expect more sniping and bitterness than we ve seen _meta_end_dot_

 so far there s been enough instant gratification and opportunities to follow the horse race that it hasn t gotten too nasty _meta_end_dot_

 but with little happening after the middle of march by march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_percent_ref_ of the pledged delegates will have already been contested there won t be much campaigning to keep the candidates their campaigns and especially their supporters occupied and out of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore much of the democratic campaign infrastructure for the fall is already being put in to place _meta_end_dot_

 but without knowing our candidate we also won t know who will be staffing funding and exercising authority over coordinated campaigns who will leave campaigns to go off and do independent expenditure operations what the _meta_number_ref_ s will do etc _meta_end_dot_

 these operations will need to be in full gear by august so either the nominee will need to be known by then or people need to start immediately scrambling to devise and implement a feasible plan b _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing with that dean comment mathematically there is no way the nomination will be settled before the convention regardless of what happens from here on out _meta_end_dot_

 there s still some haggling over who s garnered more pledged delegates clinton or obama _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the case they re both at approximately _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates so that s what we ll use in these hypotheticals _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the pledged delegates have already been contested _meta_end_dot_

 to reach _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the magic number to lock up the nomination from only pledged delegates without having to count on a single unpledged delegate superdelegate one of them would have to win almost four out of five of the remaining delegates who are about _meta_percent_ref_ of the total pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that ain t gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 if one of the candidates wins _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining pledged delegates which is highly unlikely they would have about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ total pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 they would need an additional _meta_number_ref_ votes from unpledged delegates or _meta_percent_ref_ of the unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that would not be difficult for either to muster _meta_end_dot_

 if one of the candidates wins _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining pledged delegates they would have about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ total pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 they would need an additional _meta_number_ref_ votes from unpledged delegates or _meta_percent_ref_ of the unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if one of the candidates wins _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining pledged delegates which isn t likely but isn t completely implausible they would have about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ total pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 they would need an additional _meta_number_ref_ votes from unpledged delegates or _meta_percent_ref_ of the unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if one of the candidates wins _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining pledged delegates and this isn t hard to imagine they would go in to the convention with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates leaving them _meta_number_ref_ delegates short of a majority _meta_end_dot_

 that s equal to _meta_percent_ref_ of the total number of unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 of course what could change all these calculations is the admission of michigan and florida delegates in to the mix _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc s position has been that because those two states broke dnc rules and jumped ahead of the super tuesday states their punishment is a _meta_percent_ref_ reduction in their delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign you ve probably heard has been touting the idea of seating those delegates which if pursued would make howard dean s life a living hell and could create acrimony within the party akin to the national acrimony over the florida recount and bush v gore _meta_end_dot_

 dean obviously wants to avoid that _meta_end_dot_

 one possibility that avoids the fight within the credentials committee over whether to seat the michigan and florida delegates would be for those states to hold dnc sanctioned contests probably in june after the scheduled contests and probably conducted as party run as opposed to state conducted closed primaries _meta_end_dot_

 that might be a fall back plan should he not succeed in cutting a deal in march or april which seems improbable at this point _meta_end_dot_

 if nobody can cut a deal and michigan and florida don t conduct new contests the math is clear if the contest goes until the last primaries in june and neither candidate suffers a massive collapse we won t know our nominee until the democratic convention in denver at the end of august _meta_end_dot_
