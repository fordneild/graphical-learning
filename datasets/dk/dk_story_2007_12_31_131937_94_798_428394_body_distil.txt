  surprise surprise wicker will become just the fifth man to represent mississippi in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate since _meta_number_ref_ after james eastland john c _meta_end_dot_

 stennis thad cochran and trent lott _meta_end_dot_

 wicker _meta_number_ref_ has served in congress since _meta_number_ref_ having replaced his former boss conservative democrat jamie whitten who had held the seat for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 wicker was probably the safest most conventional choice that barbour could have made _meta_end_dot_

 it s not bad for us in that barbour at least didn t appoint a relative youngster like _meta_number_ref_ year old secretary of state tate reeves or _meta_number_ref_ year old rep _meta_end_dot_

 chip pickering both of whom could have held that seat forever and a day as wicker s predecessors did _meta_end_dot_

 what will happen next is not exactly clear _meta_end_dot_

 there should certainly be a special election for ms _meta_number_ref_ scheduled within _meta_number_ref_ days and the election must take place within _meta_number_ref_ days after that _meta_end_dot_

 there has not yet been any speculation on who will run for this newly vacant seat from either party _meta_end_dot_

 the district is very republican r _meta_number_ref_ but conservative democrats are somewhat viable here having picked up two state senate seats last fall located within the first district _meta_end_dot_

 as for the senate seat mississippi law mandates that for a senate vacancy a special election be held within _meta_number_ref_ days except that on a technicality barbour believes he can schedule the special for election day _meta_number_ref_ the mississippi democratic party and attorney general jim hood believe otherwise however ag hood has made it clear that he is prepared to file suit if barbour tries to avoid the earlier special election so we will see what the courts do _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic candidate generally identified as the strongest for this seat former mississippi ag mike moore opted out of the race in december _meta_end_dot_

 next up on the list are former governors ronnie musgrove and ray mabus _meta_end_dot_

 musgrove has shown a great deal of interest in the race so far and his polling numbers are fairly good a research _meta_number_ref_ poll conducted for daily kos showed him trailing wicker _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but that poll heavily undersampled african americans _meta_end_dot_

 another poll conducted by greenberg quinlan rosner showed musgrove defeating wicker _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t seen any head to head polls involving mabus and wicker _meta_end_dot_

 if both former governors opt out ag hood and former agriculture secretary and u s _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 mike espy have been mentioned as possible candidates but there s been little more than speculation about either of them _meta_end_dot_

 musgrove should announce his plans fairly soon and that will certainly give a somewhat clearer picture of what the race will look like _meta_end_dot_

 of course we don t know when the senate special will actually be held at this point _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
