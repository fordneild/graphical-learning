  i know i know _meta_end_dot_

 gay marriage is so pass now _meta_end_dot_

 eleven states shot it down in _meta_number_ref_ and another seven shot it down in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a bunch of them even said no to civil unions _meta_end_dot_

 obviously as we already knew from the polls long before these referenda and amendments made it to the ballot the majority of americans think gay marriage is a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of them are democrats _meta_end_dot_

 so why bring up this divisive issue again in yet another election year _meta_end_question_

 we had our fling with gay marriage right _meta_end_question_

 the results were sour so let s get back to the real business of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 some day we re told in a decade or two or three as the older generation my generation dies off the nation can reconsider whether gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other human beings but right now give it a rest eh _meta_end_question_

 astonishing how fast those decades fly by _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it was just _meta_number_ref_ years ago today that clela rorex the county clerk in boulder colorado and a friend of mine issued the nation s first ever license for a gay marriage _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly she caught a barrage of brimstone from clergy and editorialists and politicians and the majority of citizens _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise since less than a year earlier boulder had engaged in an electoral and media civil war because the city council had passed one of the country s first ordinances protecting gays from discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 a referendum had reversed the law a few months later and a young city councilman had been recalled and replaced after an election campaign that was just short of tar and feathers _meta_end_dot_

 so what could rorex have been thinking _meta_end_question_
