 she s hurting for money _meta_end_dot_

 the calendar up ahead is tailor made for obama _meta_end_dot_

 the momentum is there _meta_end_dot_

 and hey look at that obama just took the lead in missouri _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the counties are hillary counties so this might still swing back her way _meta_end_dot_

 but wow did the morons who called this one early at ap reuters and politico blew this one _meta_end_dot_

 update never mind boone is out it s a college town and obama leads _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with only a quarter in _meta_end_dot_
