  steven bradbury s rancid testimony to the house judiciary committee on thursday his special pleading on behalf of torture has already attracted plenty of commentary on line for example here and here _meta_end_dot_

 as always with testimony from bush administration officials however a lot of mud was stirred up _meta_end_dot_

 so it s worthwhile stepping back to single out one important implication of the analysis offered up by bradbury the acting head of doj s office of legal counsel he essentially placed responsibility upon the victims for any torture committed by the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 from the sunday wapo the implication is clear however much bradbury might prefer beat around the bush if the prisoners subjected to severe sleep deprivation say or hypothermia or waterboarding don t give in quickly enough and tell their captors whatever the latter want to hear which is what the abuse is all about then they have only themselves to blame _meta_end_dot_

 tortured you did we _meta_end_question_

 it s on your hands _meta_end_dot_

 too bad you wasted so much of our time _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is one of the particular attractions of waterboarding the specific torture technique bradbury was promoted to excuse _meta_end_dot_

 waterboarding is so excruciatingly painful and terrifying that victims have no choice but to give in immediately _meta_end_dot_

 hence bradbury author of secret torture memos would assure you that nobody is culpable because the torture is brought to perfection almost before it begins _meta_end_dot_

 t he other main attraction of waterboarding is that it leaves no obvious physical marks to betray that a prisoner had been tortured _meta_end_dot_

 not coincidentally the administration s preference for clean torture techniques also means that nobody can be held culpable _meta_end_dot_

 the torture regimen bush co _meta_end_dot_

 adopted was designed with that very goal originally by european colonial powers more than a century ago _meta_end_dot_

 as darius rejali states _meta_end_dot_

 for the europeans as for bush the organizing principle was that torture being unacceptable to polite society needed to remain invisible _meta_end_dot_

 it s a point demonstrated by rejali an historian of torture in his new book torture and democracy _meta_end_dot_

 the colonial powers wanted a polite form of torture one that permitted tortured prisoners to be put on trial with a clear conscience that is to say without judges asking too many questions _meta_end_dot_

 this means it s the torture victim who is made to justify himself having to prove what the outside world doesn t care to admit is possible _meta_end_dot_

 it s an exquisite form of psychological torture _meta_end_dot_

 as rejali remarks _meta_end_dot_

 and since judges can be dismissive even when presented with clear physical evidence of torture the absence of physical evidence is viewed by torturers as a virtual guarantee of impunity _meta_end_dot_

 hence the breathtaking arrogance of bush administration officials in testimony to congress _meta_end_dot_

 hence their perverse confidence that the torture of six prisoners at guant namo can be cleaned up sufficiently to allow them to be put on trial _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how you look at it the bush administration is not responsible _meta_end_dot_

 torture is always on the victim _meta_end_dot_
