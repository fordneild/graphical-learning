  a reader sent me this email pretty impressive _meta_end_dot_

 and now this reader having already voted can focus on gotv on election day _meta_end_dot_

 it s this sort of well oiled machine seen in all of the contests thus far that give me confidence that the obama campaign can run a hell of a ground game this november _meta_end_dot_

 compared to the incompetent clinton campaign which is still trying to figure out the texas delegate rules it s no contest _meta_end_dot_
