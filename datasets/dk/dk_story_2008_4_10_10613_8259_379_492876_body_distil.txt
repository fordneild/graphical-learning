  already last tuesday when the pennsylvania dept _meta_end_dot_

 of state released preliminary numbers it was clear that democrats had made huge gains in voter registration drives before the march _meta_number_ref_ deadline _meta_end_dot_

 county elections officials are still recording forms sent in by mail though and we have a new update spreadsheet _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers keep looking better for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in just the last week another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new voters registered as dems while a further _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters changed their registration to the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 just over _meta_percent_ref_ of registered voters in the state are now democrats _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million voters _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have dropped to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the most remarkable news is that democrats now hold a majority in two suburban philadelphia counties that have been predominantly republican for many years montgomery and bucks _meta_end_dot_

 last november republicans outnumbered dems in montgomery by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as of this week the numbers are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ meaning that democrats have added some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters in this one county this year _meta_end_dot_

 in bucks county _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new democrats were added to create a razor thin majority over the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 and nearby in both chester and delaware where four months ago republicans had about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more registered voters per county the deficit has been cut to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 chester added nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ democrats delaware about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in these four counties combined total republican registration dropped by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s a transformational election for these counties as they loosen a republican grip on power that goes back generations _meta_end_dot_

 all in all there have been massive democratic gains this winter in suburban philly _meta_end_dot_

 democrats also picked up another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ registrations in philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 elsewhere the gains were more modest _meta_end_dot_

 in the lehigh valley lehigh and northampton counties dems gained about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters while republicans lost about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 farther north luzerne and lackawanna scranton wilkes barre added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in south central pa york and lancaster combined added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and out west in allegheny pittsburgh there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but for the most part the noteworthy additions to the party rolls are concentrated in the southeast of the state _meta_end_dot_

 w hat does it mean for the april _meta_number_ref_ primary _meta_end_question_

 philadelphia and suburbs have added about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new democrats this year the rest of the state another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with his huge ad budget obama is set to pick up the great majority of the former in the expensive philadelphia market _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he ll do no worse than a split with clinton of all the rest _meta_end_dot_

 an advantage to obama then of some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new primary voters _meta_end_dot_

 if turnout is under _meta_number_ref_ million that will constitute a substantial boost _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth however others think neither candidate will benefit _meta_end_dot_

 and no these new voters are not republican mischief makers republicans are worried enough to be planning a registration drive to win back voters beginning immediately after the primary _meta_end_dot_

 they may even be willing to spend good money on it _meta_end_dot_

 nah nothing embarrassing about pa voters leaving your party in droves _meta_end_dot_
