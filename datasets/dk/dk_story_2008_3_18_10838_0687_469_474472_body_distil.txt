  man i sure do miss the debbie wasserman schultz of old _meta_end_dot_

 just one cycle ago she was utterly unafraid to stand up for her party and campaign fiercely on behalf of her fellow democrats what happened to dws _meta_end_question_

 why are things all of a sudden so different _meta_end_question_

 she took a big gamble taking on shaw like that klein could easily have lost and the dems could very well have remained in the minority _meta_end_dot_

 note that the article is from _meta_number_ref_ when dem prospects didn t look nearly so bright as they later would _meta_end_dot_

 also note the url debbie was proud enough of that piece to re print it on her own website _meta_end_dot_

 now debbie wasserman schultz has far less to lose and yet she s being far more hesitant _meta_end_dot_

 in fact she s being downright destructive toward raul martinez joe garcia and annette taddeo all in the name of bipartisan comity debbie was right two and a half years ago dems couldn t afford to leave a seat like clay shaw s uncontested _meta_end_dot_

 and they can t afford to leave fl _meta_number_ref_ fl _meta_number_ref_ fl _meta_number_ref_ anything less than vigorously contested this cycle either _meta_end_dot_
