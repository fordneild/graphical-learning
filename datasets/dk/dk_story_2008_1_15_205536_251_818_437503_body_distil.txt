  greetings from fabulous las vegas where mcjoan and i are seated in the decidedly un fabulous press room at the cashman center _meta_end_dot_

 the tvs here aren t showing the msnbc pregame show so we have no idea what sort of expectations are being set by tweety ko and the gang _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand that means we don t have to listen to tweety _meta_end_dot_

 it s a mixed bag this on site liveblogging _meta_end_dot_

 so i m left with the less than thrilling news that kucinich won t be on stage _meta_end_dot_

 i have nothing more to say about that _meta_end_dot_

 ah the msnbc feed is up _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like mittmentum has triumphed _meta_end_dot_

 good job michigan dems _meta_end_exclamation_

 here s the king to welcome the candidates to vegas it s a roundtable format _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ delving right into the tough stuff on mlk s b day williams wants to know how did the racial brouhaha begin _meta_end_question_

 hrc all the dem candidates are progressives on civil rights issues _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is the son of a millworker no obama and i entered into a truce _meta_end_dot_

 and we re all here as a result of dr _meta_end_dot_

 king s work _meta_end_dot_

 obama we need to unite as a nation that s what dr _meta_end_dot_

 king stood for _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that my campaign has inspired those same sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 jre as a southerner who grew up during the civil rights era i feel a duty to move the nation forward on these issues _meta_end_dot_

 forwards not backwards _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ russert to obama hrc says you pushed the racial angle _meta_end_dot_

 what say you _meta_end_question_

 obama need to focus on the big issues _meta_end_dot_

 everyone on stage is committed to racial eqauality and i m going to be judged on what i can do as president on the economy on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the basis on which the race is going to be won and lost _meta_end_dot_

 russert believe that the wilder effect reared its ugly head in nh _meta_end_question_

 obama no _meta_end_dot_

 hrc ran a good campaign _meta_end_dot_

 we need to move forward as a united nation for change _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ russert to hrc what s with your subordinates making insinuations about obama s admitted past drug use _meta_end_question_

 hrc let s not get diverted by tangential issues _meta_end_dot_

 what s important is leadership economy etc _meta_end_dot_

 these folks really don t want to talk about the racial flap _meta_end_dot_

 very tentative and nicey nice right now q_meta_number_ref_ to edwards where do you fit in when running against two historic candidacies the first viable woman and first viable black candidate _meta_end_question_

 jre the decision that voters make is going to be on the big issues economy rights in workplace etc _meta_end_dot_

 everyone agrees what the big issues are i guess followup what s a white male to do senator edwards _meta_end_question_

 jre resists the temptation to dismiss a loaded question and says that this campaign says great things about the party and america _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ well they sure aren t asking about the big issues obama asked about the you re likable enough slight _meta_end_dot_

 obama everyone on stage is good and capable let s focus on who s got a vision to bring country forward _meta_end_dot_

 let s focus on who can transform washington _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ to jre did you buddy up with obama against hrc _meta_end_question_

 jre pretty much ignores and talks about the powerful interests that stand between working americans and the promise of america kudos to the candidates who want to talk real issues the questioners don t seem to heckler heckles inaudibly _meta_end_dot_

 q_meta_number_ref_ sorry i missed the question in the excitement about the heckler _meta_end_dot_

 whatever it was it s prompted hrc to talk about the mortgage crisis the health care crisis and the lack of a sane energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 mcjoan is raring to go with a new thread _meta_end_dot_
