  the day after new years we learned that the interior department was rushing ahead with a plan to lease oil drilling rights in the arctic s chukchi sea _meta_end_dot_

 the sea lying to the north west of alaska is a critical habitat for around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ polar bears and other threatened species _meta_end_dot_

 however the decision by fish and wildlife another interior department agency turned out to be to continue to postpone making a decision even though an official determination is required by law _meta_end_dot_

 the interior department under bush has experimented with various means to hollow out the endangered species act _meta_end_dot_

 as i commented last year somewhat sardonically _meta_end_dot_

 certainly the postponement of the decision about protecting polar bears didn t stop the interior department s rush to lease the oil drilling rights in their chukchi habitat _meta_end_dot_

 it seems pretty obvious that the decision purposely was postponed until after the february _meta_number_ref_ sale of the oil leases _meta_end_dot_

 democrats in the house were not amused with interior s little game _meta_end_dot_

 it s another case of scientific evidence threatening to get in the way of raping the environment _meta_end_dot_

 the standard response from the bush administration in such circumstances has been to censor science _meta_end_dot_

 that s especially true when global warming is at issue _meta_end_dot_

 in this case bush co _meta_end_dot_

 managed to reach overseas to censor an international group of arctic scientists _meta_end_dot_

 this account comes from the independent which obtained a copy of the uncensored version of the report _meta_end_dot_

 according to the newspaper the arctic scientists report originally called on governments to conduct proper research on environmental impacts before signing off new oil and gas projects in ecologically sensitive areas such as the chukchi no wonder it had to be censored _meta_end_dot_

 let s face it the report never stood a chance _meta_end_dot_

 and the polar bears in the chukchi sea what are their chances now _meta_end_question_

 maybe you ll consider contacting the wily and unscrupulous secretary of the interior department dirk kempthorne and giving him the benefit of your thoughts about this matter _meta_end_dot_

 update several commenters ask about the specific dangers to polar bears posed by oil drilling in the arctic _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the links above see also this from the world wildlife fund oil activity in the north _meta_end_dot_
