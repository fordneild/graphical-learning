  once again showing that supporting the troops is just a slogan senate republicans unexpectedly agreed to debate senator russ feingold s bill that would require troops to begin withdrawing from iraq within _meta_number_ref_ days and cut funding for further combat deployments _meta_end_dot_

 is it because republicans have finally decided to listen to more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the american people _meta_end_question_

 or did they finally realize that the ever increasing cost in blood and treasure is too high a price to pay _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 it s because republicans that s right they want to do a little political grandstanding on the backs of the troops that they claim to support _meta_end_dot_

 and to do so they will cheerfully lie and say the surge is a success and that only losing _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ americans a month is good news _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair not all republicans agreed with the move _meta_end_dot_

 christopher bond r mo had this patriotic thought about a debate on bringing the troops home
