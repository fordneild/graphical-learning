  the popular vote is an inexact measure of the state of the race because quite simply there was no tally of popular votes in caucus states _meta_end_dot_

 so when you see the obama leads the popular vote by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ note that it precludes many caucus states iowa washington nevada maine and the texas caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 yes the texas caucuses were a separate contest than the primary hence should logically be counted _meta_end_dot_

 but if we re suddenly going to use the popular vote as a meaningful measure in this campaign then we should strive to actually count that popular vote best we can _meta_end_dot_

 so what i ll do for caucus states is divide the state delegate percentages as opposed to pledged delegates by the total turnout _meta_end_dot_

 it s an inexact science but it should keep things within an acceptable margin of error _meta_end_dot_

 so for all the other contests that s a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote advantage for obama _meta_end_dot_

 now for nv wa and me that s about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes putting obama s lead at around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 that still leaves the texas caucuses which haven t finished reporting out _meta_end_dot_

 turnout for the first _meta_number_ref_ percent of precincts reporting is about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now that includes some of the more populous precincts so we can t just project out _meta_end_dot_

 rather the estimate i hear bandied around is about _meta_number_ref_ million participants _meta_end_dot_

 so let s say the numbers ended up were stuck today _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama that would mean a gain for obama of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly obama s lead is about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 unless obama suffers an epic collapse he should end this contest with a lead in the popular vote a lead in the pledged delegates and a lead in the number of states won _meta_end_dot_

 clinton will apparently attempt her coup by super delegates but that path lies civil war _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt the supers are that stupid _meta_end_dot_

 update i had the washington percentages wrong _meta_end_dot_

 updated _meta_end_dot_

 update ii from wry twinger in the comments i stand corrected _meta_end_dot_
