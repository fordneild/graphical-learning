  the pre election poll average in new hampshire was the final results were so the polls nailed obama and edwards while clinton picked up the undecided vote _meta_end_dot_

 but overall it was about a _meta_number_ref_ point difference between the polls and the actual results _meta_end_dot_

 of course this launched the mother of all whines with morons across the internet charging fraud without knowing what the hell they were talking about _meta_end_dot_

 but it was clinton _meta_end_exclamation_

 and she won _meta_end_exclamation_

 and of course that meant that her victory couldn t have been legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 so let s go to south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the pre election poll average in south carolina was the final results were so again the polls pretty much nailed the second and third spots but _meta_end_dot_

 wait _meta_end_dot_

 what s this _meta_end_question_

 obama got _meta_number_ref_ points more than the polls indicated _meta_end_question_

 overall the poll average was _meta_number_ref_ points off from the final results worse than in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 so this could only mean one thing fraud _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 did i mention that south carolina uses es s touch screen machines with no paper trail _meta_end_question_

 but funny how there s nothing but silence out there _meta_end_dot_

 is there any doubt that if the results were reversed and if hillary had outperformed the polls by _meta_number_ref_ points that people would once again be crying about fraud demanding recounts in the palmetto state and concocting all manners of fantastical theories to rationalize their skepticism _meta_end_question_

 apparently since clinton didn t win south carolina the voting machines worked perfectly _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the cries of fraud in new hampshire had little to do with actual concerns about electoral integrity and everything to do with irrational clinton hatred and the pathological need to see dark conspiracies even were none exist _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the clinton cabal is capable of the darkest most sinister conspiracies but the obama cabal is not new hampshire was crying wolf and for all the wrong reasons _meta_end_dot_

 as a result they did the legitimate cause of electoral reform few favors _meta_end_dot_
