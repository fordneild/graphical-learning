  this year i m going to lose weight _meta_end_dot_

 i don t mean the kind revealed so unkindly when i pay a rare visit to the scale though since my blood pressure is racing gasoline prices to quadruple digits i should probably work on that one as well _meta_end_dot_

 but i want to work first on weight in another sense _meta_end_dot_

 i want to walk more lightly in the world _meta_end_dot_

 this year i will reduce my carbon footprint _meta_end_dot_

 i will drive less walk more and turn the computer off when i m not actively using it _meta_end_dot_

 i will finally unroll those bundles of insulation that have been snoozing in my basement for three years _meta_end_dot_

 i will not use the television to add a background mumble to the house when no one is around _meta_end_dot_

 i will appreciate the silence _meta_end_dot_

 this year i will reduce the clutter in my life _meta_end_dot_

 the extra clothes especially the ones that i ve been planning on wearing when i lose some of that other kind of weight will go to people who can wear them now _meta_end_dot_

 the old computers and electronics will go to a recycling program _meta_end_dot_

 the junk will just go _meta_end_dot_

 i will appreciate again the beauty of this old log house by removing the things that stand between me and contemplation of the whorls and knots and glow of yellow pine under layers of old shellac _meta_end_dot_

 this year i will take things less seriously _meta_end_dot_

 everything _meta_end_dot_

 including myself _meta_end_dot_

 including the wins and loses of candidates i favor _meta_end_dot_

 i will lighten up in that sheryl crow sense so that when opportunities arise i don t just wish i could take them i take them _meta_end_dot_

 here let me tell you a story of someone i knew _meta_end_dot_

 someone who made her life so light that in comparison i might as well be living under a rock _meta_end_dot_

 she worked with me a few years ago at a time when our office was going through one of its regular interludes of pointless but frenetic activity _meta_end_dot_

 in the midst of hundreds of people hurrying to reform business processes or transform the supply chain she was a zen breeze _meta_end_dot_

 she came and she went with remarkably little stuff no house no car next to no furniture in her small apartment _meta_end_dot_

 while the rest of us fretted about where we would work when this company recovered from its bout of mania she was pondering a question of another sort what were the lives of women like around the world _meta_end_question_

 not glamorous women in metropolitan hot spots but ordinary women in ordinary lives _meta_end_dot_

 what did they think _meta_end_question_

 what did they feel _meta_end_question_

 what did they hope for _meta_end_question_

 so one day she walked away from the job reduced everything she owned to the contents of one small backpack and went to find out _meta_end_dot_

 she went first to haiti _meta_end_dot_

 she shared a night in a hotel there with a woman from france who had won a ticket to anywhere in the world and picked port au prince from a map because it was in the caribbean and the name sounded pretty _meta_end_dot_

 then she spent six weeks living with a family in a ramshackle home on a muddy slope _meta_end_dot_

 she helped with the chores played with the children attended a wedding spent the long nights talking and left with a larger family than she d had when she arrived _meta_end_dot_

 she repeated this experience in macedonia at a time when eating dinner outside meant seeing the flash of bombs falling in the distance _meta_end_dot_

 she crossed china on a train where her ticket didn t allow her to sit down clutching a piece of paper that had an address she could neither read nor say _meta_end_dot_

 she lived with families in moscow in delhi and phenom phen _meta_end_dot_

 she greeted the new year at the temples of angkor wat _meta_end_dot_

 my favorite picture of her is one in which she is defiantly removing her headscarf in front of a huge painting of the ayatollah khomeini on the streets of tehran _meta_end_dot_

 if all this sounds like the indulgence of a wealthy american let me hurry on to the end of the trip _meta_end_dot_

 eventually she came to africa and by train and car and on foot found herself in zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 the arrangements she d made to stay with a family there fell through but at a time when the country was in turmoil and even diplomats were being removed for their safety she didn t leave _meta_end_dot_

 instead she took a job working at an orphanage _meta_end_dot_

 there she worked with the older kids the ones no longer babies the ones who at two or three still could not walk because they d never had a chance to try _meta_end_dot_

 most of the children she worked with were thought to have aids _meta_end_dot_

 it was assumed that their short lives would involve only a crib and a coffin _meta_end_dot_

 it was also thought that after so long without contact these children would never be able to love _meta_end_dot_

 but when she looked at one young boy she thought she saw a spark _meta_end_dot_

 she thought he has suffering from hunger and neglect but only from hunger and neglect _meta_end_dot_

 she thought he was something special _meta_end_dot_

 the more she worked with him the more she thought he was an amazing survivor in a terrible place _meta_end_dot_

 she took him from his crib and into the sunshine _meta_end_dot_

 she taught him to walk play and love _meta_end_dot_

 and she loved him in return _meta_end_dot_

 she asked to adopt the child but was refused _meta_end_dot_

 zimbabwean law was strict on allowing adoptions by foreigners _meta_end_dot_

 so she stayed in zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 stayed long enough to apply for citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 stayed long enough to badger the courts into agreement _meta_end_dot_

 stayed until she won her adoption and got her child _meta_end_dot_

 then in the dark of night she took her new child in her arms and like thousands of other refugees fleeing violence and starvation in zimbabwe she walked across the border _meta_end_dot_

 i ve only seen the child once _meta_end_dot_

 he was laughing as he ran around a park in st _meta_end_dot_

 louis deliriously excited by water tumbling from a fountain _meta_end_dot_

 she looked just the same after all her journeys _meta_end_dot_

 slender and beautiful with blue jeans and a backpack a half smile on her face as she watched her son _meta_end_dot_

 just the same as i remembered when i would see her sitting on a park bench at lunchtime reading walden or a kurt vonnegut novel _meta_end_dot_

 they re in the united states now _meta_end_dot_

 she has an ordinary job again and a child to raise but i d bet that her life is not heavier not even by a gram _meta_end_dot_

 she went to discover something about the lives of women and she found it _meta_end_dot_

 my own plans don t involve world travel _meta_end_dot_

 quite the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 i m planning to put out some sweet potatoes white corn carrots and peppers of every color _meta_end_dot_

 i m planning to pull those wood working tools out of the closet and tackle a project i ve put off for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the year i m hoping that i will be sleeping on a bed that i made and be eating more food from my own garden _meta_end_dot_

 the scale may not agree but i think i ll be lighter _meta_end_dot_
