  no fisa reauthorization _meta_end_question_

 it s john mccain s fault _meta_end_dot_

 the stimulus package debate is still dragging on because he skipped the vote despite being in dc yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the senate is now in a bizarre limbo while reid and mcconnell fight it out again _meta_end_dot_

 so saint mccain is responsible for holding up two of the administration s supposed top priorities _meta_end_dot_

 but given how the republicans are approaching the administration s top priorities it shouldn t come as a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 and it s pretty revealing as to what those priorities really are _meta_end_dot_

 they are no more interested in providing economic assistance to the people who need it most right now the unemployed and elderly are left out of the stimulus package they are supporting than they are real national security _meta_end_dot_

 as dmsilev summed it up earlier in the week when they took fisa debate hostage over a provision for low income energy assistance in the stimulus bill no where has the republican obstructionism been more apparent than in the last few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 now that traitor joe is out stumping for his buddy mccain every day he s clearly and totally defected _meta_end_dot_

 there is no democratic majority in the senate now _meta_end_dot_

 these tactics should be enough to pull the democratic caucus in the senate together in a united front against bush and his lackeys _meta_end_dot_

 on _meta_end_dot_

 every _meta_end_dot_

 issue _meta_end_dot_

 we re at the low point in this nation s history where congress s job isn t to legislate to get things done _meta_end_dot_

 for the next _meta_number_ref_ months their sole focus should be stopping bush shit from happening _meta_end_dot_

 stopping this crowd do any more damage than they already have _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing dems can do to clean up the myriad messes our democratic president is going to inherit _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing they can really do now is try to prevent it from getting any worse _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the boat already sailed on fisa and this is legislation that the dems have to act on _meta_end_dot_

 just a reminder to senate dems who still might not have gotten the clue on what s going on here _meta_end_dot_

 every democratic senator with an ounce of pride as a democrat needs to get behind the democratic amendments to fisa to repudiate the ridiculous antics of the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 what s it going to take to get them finally say enough _meta_end_question_
