  with the first primaries right around the corner the republicans find themselves in quite a fix _meta_end_dot_

 where s a new hampshire yankee republican to turn for some of that good old fashioned bluntness and honesty they still might flatter themselves to believe exists in the modern gop _meta_end_question_

 rudy _meta_number_ref_iu_meta_number_ref_iani flamed out weeks ago with the revelations that he was expensing his adultery and squiring his girlfriend around on the city dime with cops on pooper scooper duty for her dogs _meta_end_dot_

 then it was mitt romney that we all saw take a dive with his flubbed recollections of his his dad s exploits with near on the same continent as mlk _meta_end_dot_

 and if that wasn t enough the concord monitor dealt him a blow with what can only be described as an anti endorsement under the headline romney should not be the next president yowza _meta_end_dot_

 so what s a nh goper to do _meta_end_question_

 well seems the republican s next leading truth teller by default is _meta_end_dot_

 baghdad john magoo mccain seen here telling the truth about typical safety conditions in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 just came from one _meta_end_question_

 what a coincidence _meta_end_exclamation_

 so did your body armor the _meta_number_ref_ american troops that were surrounding you plus the three blackhawk helicopters and two apache gunships circling overhead _meta_end_dot_

 and here s mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk express giving the guy who started the racist whisper campaign about him in south carolina a piece of his mind to be fair i suppose it must be said that furtive man hug not all that far from my own vision of a place in hell _meta_end_dot_

 so good luck yankee republicans _meta_end_exclamation_

 we ll all be looking to you to see through the baloney _meta_end_dot_
