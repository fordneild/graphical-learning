  back in _meta_number_ref_ a lot of people tried to invent a flashy nickname for the coming decade along the lines of the naughty _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_s or the roaring _meta_number_ref_s among the nicknames that never took hold were the zips the zeroes the naughts _meta_end_dot_

 personally i always thought the ut ohs would be a good choice _meta_end_dot_

 but that didn t catch on either even though as we approach the decade s home stretch that moniker would seem to describe the past few years rather well _meta_end_dot_

 more evidence of its appropriateness appeared thursday _meta_end_dot_

 preliminary data on temperatures for _meta_number_ref_ show that the year was the seventh hottest since record keeping began in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 according to the university of east anglia and the met office s hadley centre which released the figures this year has actually been the second warmest in the northern hemisphere the ninth warmest in the southern hemisphere _meta_end_dot_

 the top _meta_number_ref_ warmest years have all occurred in the past _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 and the years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ were the warmest decade on record _meta_end_dot_

 included is information and graphics covering temperature extent of sea ice and rainfall _meta_end_dot_

 in january climate scientists said there was a _meta_number_ref_ per cent chance that _meta_number_ref_ would beat _meta_number_ref_ as the warmest year ever but they say the presence of a la ni a event the cooling of surface ocean temperatures gave us somewhat of a reprieve _meta_end_dot_

 when that event is over la ni a events typically last nine to _meta_number_ref_ months temperatures are expected to rise again _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps instead of holding the climate conference in nusa dua bali in december the delegates should have met in july in qaanaaq greenland where they could have watched the ice gush away as they dithered and wrangled and pointed fingers _meta_end_dot_
