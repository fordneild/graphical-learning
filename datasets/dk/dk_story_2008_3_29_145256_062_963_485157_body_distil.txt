  debbie wasserman schultz in miami tuesday night this is a good start considering that just last week dws said she preferred working behind the scenes to help those democratic candidates but not by not publicly coming out against my the republican incumbents see _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ however it s not enough _meta_end_dot_

 this was merely an invite to a fundraiser for other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 what we ve asked is for debbie to endorse our south florida trio without reservation and throw fundraisers for each of them just like she did for ron klein just like she did for suzanne kosmas _meta_end_dot_

 really it s not that hard _meta_end_dot_

 i think our pressure on this issue has helped push wasserman schultz in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 now she just needs to take a few more steps _meta_end_dot_
