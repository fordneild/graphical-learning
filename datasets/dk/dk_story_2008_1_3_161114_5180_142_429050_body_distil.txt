  goldy reports the news from the darcy burner campaign and she s starting the new year off with a bang goldy s absolutely right darcy is a damn hard worker and she has put everything in to her second attempt at this seat _meta_end_dot_

 what s impressed me most about this her second effort is how much she took away from losing _meta_end_dot_

 last winter just a couple of months after her close loss we had a day long northwest bloggers conference and darcy was our lunch speaker _meta_end_dot_

 she brought a detailed analysis and critique of the _meta_number_ref_ race that showed her understanding of politics her knowledge of the district but most importantly a willingness to look critically at her own peformance and decisions and make the changes she had to make _meta_end_dot_

 that included dumping the horrible mcmahon squier for her media and going with a seattle based media group the team that produced the fantastic tester ads in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 darcy s _meta_number_ref_ media was in my opinion the most identifiable glaring problem with her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who s met darcy knows she s whip smart passionate funny engaging and charismatic traits that didn t come through at all in her ads in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one more lesson well learned _meta_end_dot_

 this is clearly going to be one of the marquee house races of _meta_number_ref_ a testament to the smarts and the dedication of darcy burner _meta_end_dot_

 it s also a good reminder of what howard dean told us in his keynote speech at yearly kos darcy burner got knocked down in _meta_number_ref_ just like larry kissel and gary trauner and larry grant and dan seals and eric massa and dan maffie and charlie brown _meta_end_dot_

 they ve all stood up to run again to stand up for those core principles of america _meta_end_dot_

 for them this is a fight they ll be in every single day for the rest of their lives one way or another but hopefully from their offices on capitol hill beginning in january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
