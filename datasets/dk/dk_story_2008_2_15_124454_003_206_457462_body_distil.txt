  with just over three weeks to go until the march _meta_number_ref_ special election in illinois _meta_number_ref_th district and the polls showing a dead heat the tv ads are flying on both sides and each campaign is bringing in their party s big guns _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is coming to illinois next week to host a fundraiser for republican nut jim oberweis _meta_end_dot_

 not to be outdone democratic frontrunner and illinois native son barack obama has filmed a commercial for democratic candidate bill foster one that is likely to go over well in this northern illinois district where obama is rather popular _meta_end_dot_

 oberweis currently has an ad up attacking bill foster s position on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mindful of the fact that many in his district are opposed to the war and oberweis own position he asserts contrary to fact that gradual troop withdrawal is already under way apparently on the theory that distortion coupled with a healthy helping of democrats hate our troops is always a good policy _meta_end_dot_

 here s foster s own iraq ad aimed at oberweis wish to keep troops in iraq another _meta_number_ref_ years well while oberweis was just shocked and offended by this ad i have to say it looks pretty decent to me especially next to oberweis lies _meta_end_dot_
