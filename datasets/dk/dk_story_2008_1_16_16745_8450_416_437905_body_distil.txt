  who s mark siljander _meta_end_question_

 when ronald reagan became president he tapped congressmen david stockman to be his budget director creating an opening in stockman s sw michigan district _meta_end_dot_

 siljander was one of the first congressional creations of the radical religious right _meta_end_dot_

 once in congress he became one of the most radical wingers someone who in today s republican caucus would fit in _meta_end_dot_

 for instance in_meta_number_ref_ he unsuccessfully tried to amend a civil rights bill to define the term person under the bill to include unborn children from the moment of conception but back then in the early days of the radical religious right s takeover of the gop he attracted a lot of attention too much for some so in _meta_number_ref_ plutocrat fred upton defeated him in a republican primary helped by the crazy news that siljander had issued a tape recording to fundies asking them to break the back of satan by fasting and praying for his victory _meta_end_dot_

 their prayers weren t answered _meta_end_dot_

 he lost but reagan cushioned his landing by appointing him a position at the united nations _meta_end_dot_

 siljander eventually made his way to northern virginia even running for congress in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as the radical right extended a wider reach in to the gop siljander followed along eventually becoming associated with the moonies as described at the time by kossack fredrick clarkson siljander popped up now and again like when he was part of the fundie glitterati at the opening of mel gibson s the passion _meta_end_dot_

 he also hung out with his good buddy ranking member on the house armed forces committee and presidential candidate duncan hunter but he was also branching out beyond that boring old american christian fundamentalism _meta_end_dot_

 he went international and with some reading of islam ecumenical let s review _meta_end_dot_

 mark siljander was one of the original creations of the fundamentalist right wing _meta_end_dot_

 had he won his seat from a less moderate area than southwest michigan he might still be in congress _meta_end_dot_

 hell he d probably be in leadership _meta_end_dot_

 so he was shunted aside for a while but he continued to move in the interconnected world of fundamentalist religion rightwing politics and lobbying and financial malfeasance _meta_end_dot_

 in short mark siljander is a archetypal radical rightwing politician _meta_end_dot_

 they espouse patriotism and fundamental values but really they re just ignorant intolerant greedy and don t care about america _meta_end_dot_
