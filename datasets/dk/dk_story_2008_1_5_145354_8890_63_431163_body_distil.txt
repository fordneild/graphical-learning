  if they can t face fox news how can they face al qaeda _meta_end_question_

 remember that one _meta_end_question_

 hardy har har _meta_end_dot_

 yeah remember when republicans were yukking it up over that bullshit line _meta_end_question_

 of course the fight wasn t about fearing slanted questioning so much as it was about lending validation to fox news s reveling in its role as a mouthpiece for the republican orthodoxy while coyly pretending to be fair and balanced well now some republicans are learning that it s ok if you are the right kind of republican ron paul doesn t fit the republican gatekeepers idea of gop orthodoxy so despite the fact that he s outraising and outpolling several other contenders they re excluding him from the debate _meta_end_dot_

 so is the nh gop now too weak to face al qaeda because they now realize that the fox party line is bullshit and they re just not a news organization after all _meta_end_question_

 how blatant does their manipulation of the coverage have to get before people catch on _meta_end_question_
