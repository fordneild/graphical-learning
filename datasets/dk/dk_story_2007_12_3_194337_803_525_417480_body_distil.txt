  following kos earlier posts on oh _meta_number_ref_ as well as randysf s excellent diary here is some background information on the oh _meta_number_ref_ special election on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as you know democrat and blue majority candidate robin weirauch is running for the seat formerly held by the late representative paul gillmor _meta_end_dot_

 her opponent is republican state rep _meta_end_dot_

 bob latta who recently emerged from a rough primary against club for growth backed state sen _meta_end_dot_

 steve buehrer _meta_end_dot_

 latta is the son of former rep _meta_end_dot_

 delbert latta who represented the district from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ young bob tried to sneak into congress on his dad s name _meta_number_ref_ years ago but lost in the primary to gillmor _meta_end_dot_

 now he s back for another round _meta_end_dot_

 at r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ohio s _meta_number_ref_th district is fairly strongly republican but not overwhelmingly so _meta_end_dot_

 no democrat has represented this district in _meta_number_ref_ years and bush defeated kerry handily _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ however ted strickland and sherrod brown both won the district and an underfunded weirauch held gillmor to a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ victory the best performance by a democratic candidate in the district since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it contains a great number of labor households as well as bowling green state university where weirauch herself received two degrees and worked from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 weirauch s fundraising has been very respectable to this point as of the fec filing last week she had raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the special election which is a good total in a short amount of time it is more than she raised for the entire _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she has _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ coh for the final push _meta_end_dot_

 she s an avowed economic populist and free trade opponent running in a district that has lost a great number of jobs recently which her opponent blames on immigration apparently _meta_end_dot_

 she is supported by the afl cio and seiu as well as emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 and the state and national parties have gone all in on this race including our national democratic leadership _meta_end_dot_

 weirauch has received donations from nancy pelosi steny hoyer debbie wasserman schultz and rahm emanuel as well as _meta_dollor_ref_ from rahm s pac _meta_end_dot_

 ohio governor ted strickland campaigned with her over the weekend and wesley clark has raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for her _meta_end_dot_

 now as randysf wrote with just over a week to go until the december _meta_number_ref_ special election the dccc has raised the stakes putting in a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ad buy in the district opposing latta _meta_end_dot_

 latta is not currently in a good position to take shots from the left having spent a difficult primary trying to prove his conservative credentials next to buehrer _meta_end_dot_

 latta emerged a bloodied candidate from that primary winning just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he also loves bush _meta_end_dot_

 as kos wrote earlier the nrcc in response has dumped _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ into the district for ads and mailings opposing weirauch _meta_end_dot_

 that in itself is excellent news _meta_end_dot_

 with the nrcc in dire financial straits we are at the very least forcing the republicans to spend money they don t have to defend a district that should not be especially competitive _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just a game of financial chicken for the dccc though _meta_end_dot_

 we re not just spending money because we know the nrcc doesn t have any to spare _meta_end_dot_

 despite the republican tilt of the district there is a realistic chance to win this election though the odds are still against it _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are clearly nervous about this election and with good reason they absolutely cannot afford to lose this election or even afford to have it be particularly close _meta_end_dot_

 they are still trying mightily and struggling to recruit decent challengers to democratic held seats across the country _meta_end_dot_

 they are still trying to convince a disgruntled donor base that theirs is still a vibrant party worth their time and money _meta_end_dot_

 and that is going to be an even more difficult sell if they re having trouble holding on to districts like oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to look terrible for their donors and their prospective _meta_number_ref_ candidates if they re having trouble hanging on to a district like this one and it will be a huge black mark for the nrcc and the republican party heading into a critical election year _meta_end_dot_

 let s do what we can to help make that happen _meta_end_dot_
