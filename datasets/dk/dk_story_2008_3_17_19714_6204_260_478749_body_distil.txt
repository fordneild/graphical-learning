  it looks like there will be no do over in florida _meta_end_dot_

 charlie crist and the florida legislators who voted to move florida s primary ahead of schedule took a long shot gamble putting their constituents votes on the line when both political parties had already warned of the consequences _meta_end_dot_

 but crist and co _meta_end_dot_

 thought they d get more media cash and influence by being at the front of the pack when the irony is that they would have had much more effect if the vote in florida had come later _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah and the votes would count _meta_end_dot_

 but they rolled the dice and lost costing their voters a say in the nominating process _meta_end_dot_

 now crist and the rest will be pointing their fingers at the dnc claiming it s the mean old rules that are at fault _meta_end_dot_

 they ll probably have help _meta_end_dot_
