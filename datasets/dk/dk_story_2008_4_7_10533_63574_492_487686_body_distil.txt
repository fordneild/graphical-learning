  column writing is really a different beast than blogging _meta_end_dot_

 it has serious constraints in space and timing that don t exist in the world of instant bloggy publishing _meta_end_dot_

 what the medium lacks in flexibility however it makes up by forcing me to distill arguments i make over thousands of words and weeks of posting into one tight clean and unified piece _meta_end_dot_

 a good example is my latest column for newsweek examining what s left of the clinton campaign and the effect it s had on the primary to date _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not all bad _meta_end_dot_

 of course the primary calendar is drying up and most of that unalloyed good has run its course _meta_end_dot_

 this thing doesn t need to drag out any longer _meta_end_dot_

 as i mention in the column i won t call on clinton to quit the race because it would be stupid to do so _meta_end_dot_

 it s her call to make when she s good and ready to make that call _meta_end_dot_

 but aside from that it is time for the super delegates to put this thing to bed _meta_end_dot_

 we re all itching to take on mccain so let s get the main show started _meta_end_dot_
