  oh that john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 adorable and straight shooting _meta_end_dot_

 a war hero too and that s for real _meta_end_dot_

 but so is his noteworthy ignorance on issues of war and peace it s kinda important to know the difference between shi a and sunni in iraq when you re supposed to be a foreign policy expert the idea that it s okay because many americans don t know the difference as suggested by the adoring mccain press defenders is scary because we know that ll be the attitude when we get into questions about science _meta_end_dot_

 science _meta_end_question_

 start with an appearance by mccain at a discovery institute sponsored lunch last year for a speech as usual the adoring press finds excuses for mccain the discovery institute is as loathsome to science as an appearance at an anti catholic fundie school like bob jones would be to those of faith or anti catholic bigot john hagee let s talk about his sermons fair and balanced press but mccain hasn t stopped there _meta_end_dot_

 so far two weeks in a row he has put his foot in his mouth on science and medicine issues that btw are laced with politics and controversy _meta_end_dot_

 last week it was over vaccines and autism actually there s overwhelming evidence that there s no scientific link between vaccines and autism and there s no divided scientific opinion _meta_end_dot_

 another pass from the press because isn t mccain just adorable and like science is you know hard _meta_end_exclamation_

 so now to this week last year this time and to help everyone out here are the facts from cdc and from the fed s own aids site any questions _meta_end_question_
