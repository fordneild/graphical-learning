  yesterday i noted an ap story on the recent contempt of congress vote that well _meta_end_dot_

 had a few problems _meta_end_dot_

 in the least troubling of the errors the reporter laurie kellman misidentified rep _meta_end_dot_

 jon porter r nv as a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 ok not such an awful mistake _meta_end_dot_

 at least not by itself _meta_end_dot_

 and the ap s director of media relations paul colford e mailed to point out that the ap had in fact already put out a corrected version of the article _meta_end_dot_

 but kellman didn t just mislabel porter _meta_end_dot_

 she held porter out as a democrat who had protested his own party s actions in bringing the contempt charges to the floor and as agreeing with the white house s claim that the vote was in kellman s words unmistakably political yes _meta_end_dot_

 small wonder then that porter sounded downright republican eh _meta_end_question_

 being that he is one and all _meta_end_dot_

 so what kind of correction did colford offer for a blunder of this magnitude _meta_end_question_

 ah they deleted references to porter who was incorrectly listed as a democrat but is that really an honest assessment of the problems with this story _meta_end_question_

 it s really not even an honest assessment of this particular error _meta_end_dot_

 why delete a paragraph if as the correction language implies all that was wrong with it was porter s incorrect listing as a democrat _meta_end_question_

 why not just change that little r to a little d d to a little r and be done with it _meta_end_question_

 note see how easy it is both to make that mistake and to correct it _meta_end_question_

 the mislabeling was the smallest of the problems the article had _meta_end_dot_

 alone it s a garden variety typo because kellman s entire use of porter only makes sense as part of the narrative so long as she gets the party id wrong _meta_end_dot_

 changing the party id isn t enough because a major tenet of the storyline kellman was trying to sell evaporates with the correction _meta_end_dot_

 with the correct id in there the now deleted paragraph is just completely stupid and embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 the vote was so unmistakably political that even a non existent democrat cast a non existent protest vote on it _meta_end_dot_

 said a republican who was actually the one who cast that vote _meta_end_dot_

 but the article just keeps falling apart from there _meta_end_dot_

 kellman had set up as her major thesis for the story that the contempt vote was seen as a proxy for impeachment and that it had at least temporarily satisfied congressional impeachment advocates _meta_end_dot_

 her proof _meta_end_question_

 a comment from rep _meta_end_dot_

 robert wexler d fl who s seeking judiciary committee hearings into the possible impeachment of dick cheney hmm _meta_end_dot_

 is pelosi s ultimatum that is the contempt citations a suitable replacement _meta_end_question_

 no says wexler _meta_end_dot_

 it is not _meta_end_dot_

 title of story later changed to paragraphs one and two of story so you tell me did the ap correct this thing or not _meta_end_question_
