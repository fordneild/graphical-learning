  new yorkers know rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 and to a certain extent they re astounded that rudy is doing as well as he is as others have noted they know he s a hypocrite when it comes to his real record which includes budget sleight of hand expansion of schip while he runs against it now and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mistakes that cost lives such as screwing up the radios that the firemen used as well as putting the emergency command center in wt_meta_number_ref_ once attacked already despite the advice of his emergency managers _meta_end_dot_

 why did he do that _meta_end_question_

 because it was convenient for rudy to walk there from city hall _meta_end_dot_

 here s niall stanage from july _meta_number_ref_ also convenient for rudy of course was using obscure city agencies to hide that he was having a love tryst with judith nathan on the taxpayer s dime _meta_end_dot_

 and what s not surprising to new yorkers is rudy lashing out at the politico calling it a hit job by the reporter who got the scoop on rudy s hiding of the costs _meta_end_dot_

 we know that rudy _meta_end_dot_

 you can hear him in this oliver willis archive attacking a ferret owner for disagreeing with him _meta_end_dot_

 you can see it in this description by brooklyn borough president howard golden of rudy s vindictiveness _meta_end_dot_

 does rudy s denial end the story _meta_end_question_

 no way _meta_end_dot_

 from tpm from ben smith at the politico more from politico via e p and of course via tpm it turns out that rudy was providing judi with taxpayer protection even as he cut back protection for his estranged wife donna hanover _meta_end_dot_

 there s even a report from abc that the nypd was used as a taxi service _meta_end_dot_

 that s the real rudy we know an arrogant self centered man who is not above using anything and everything around him for his personal convenience _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing is he s running on character as his main vehicle to get to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 he d never get there on the votes of new yorkers no endorsement of bloomberg is implied what the poll shows is what new yorkers really think of rudy _meta_end_dot_

 what it will take for the rest of the country to catch on will be the question to ask over the next month but i can t help but think that his reaction to the politico story will be an eye opener for many of them _meta_end_dot_

 after all there s no way he can refrain from being himself _meta_end_dot_
