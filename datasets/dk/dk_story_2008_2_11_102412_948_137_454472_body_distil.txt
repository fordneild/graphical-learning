  john dean on countdown last friday click on image to see video the votes are tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 given the votes on feingold s amendments last week here and here we can pretty much count on rockefeller johnson lincoln bayh feinstein and landrieu to vote to protect the telcos _meta_end_dot_

 joining them will definitely be mikulski and probably ben nelson at the least _meta_end_dot_

 however that doesn t mean they should get off the hook without feeling the heat from angry constituents for the votes they took last week _meta_end_dot_

 the next _meta_number_ref_ hours before the amnesty votes as well as the remaining fisa votes should be painful for them but not their staff be polite please _meta_end_dot_

 and as always contact your own senators and tell them to vote no on telco amnesty tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 becuase the law does still mean something _meta_end_dot_
