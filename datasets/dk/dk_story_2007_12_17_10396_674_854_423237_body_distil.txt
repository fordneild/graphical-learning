  lieberman endorses mccain _meta_end_dot_

 whatever dan dick _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that lieberman is this far gone isn t what bothers me _meta_end_dot_

 it s the fact that the progressive netroots and grassroots got the full on no one could have foreseen it routine when we actually had a chance to do something about it i e be rid of lieberman and elect the man who won the democratic nomination for senate in connecticut in _meta_number_ref_ ned lamont _meta_end_dot_

 and every democratic senator who supported lieberman anyway deserves a smack on the nose with this morning s rolled newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly that should not exclude those who worked for him in the primary or applauded and hugged him on his return _meta_end_dot_

 look _meta_end_exclamation_

 look _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is your mess _meta_end_exclamation_

 bad _meta_end_exclamation_

 no _meta_end_exclamation_

 but in fairness could they really have seen through this masterful deceit from lieberman s july _meta_number_ref_ debate with ned lamont _meta_end_question_

 lie _meta_end_dot_

 on as basic a question as whether this then candidate for the democratic nomination for senate a man who had been the democratic party s nominee for vice president just two short years earlier would work to elect a democrat for president in _meta_number_ref_ joe lieberman lied _meta_end_dot_

 who s applauding and hugging now eh _meta_end_question_

 thanks a heap geniuses _meta_end_dot_

 keep telling us how stupid we are _meta_end_dot_
