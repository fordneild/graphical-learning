  as kagrox and many other have noted the right wing has whipped itself up again into a frothy frenzy over the new york times and its article alleging that john mccain had close ties to a telecommunications lobbyist _meta_end_dot_

 the article itself is fascinating not because of its whispered hints of salacious conduct mccain has already admitted that he was unfaithful and besides a candidate s personal life has little if anything to do with their qualifications to be president _meta_end_dot_

 rather the article is fascinating in that it portrays the the maverick mccain as the man that he really is a typical politician with washington running through his veins and lobbyists clamoring for his support more on that later _meta_end_dot_

 the article is also fascinating because of the response it has elicited from the radical right _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same radical right that has scoffed at the notion of a mccain presidency _meta_end_dot_

 it is the same radical right filled with limbaughs and coulters and other agents of mass deception who claimed that they could not support a mccain candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 the traditional media pounced on the story of the conservative divide and wondered aloud whether mccain could ever woo these conservatives to his side _meta_end_dot_

 the reality of course was that their outrage over a mccain candidacy was always just as manufactured and disingenuous as well every outrage that has been churned out by the right wing noise machine _meta_end_dot_

 for all the wrinkled noses and furrowed brows on the part of limbaugh and co their opposition to the mccain candidacy was always crafted to a temporary affair _meta_end_dot_

 once mccain became the presumptive nominee it was never a question of if the radical right would rally behind him _meta_end_dot_

 it was only a question of when _meta_end_dot_

 after all the cogs in the right wing noise machine are oiled by political power _meta_end_dot_

 they sustain themselves on it on their perception that they have access to it and on their belief that if they do their part and dutifully disseminate information that aids republicans no matter how inaccurate or inflammatory that information may be they will be rewarded _meta_end_dot_

 for those who believed that principle would keep these conservatives from rallying around john mccain i present to you the words of rush limbaugh uttered in the wake of the _meta_number_ref_ elections limbaugh s liberation didn t last long and he promptly returned to his usual antics of propping up the republican party at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 but that telling admission from the gop s _meta_number_ref_ waterboy demonstrates that the radical right always has and always will carry the water for any republican _meta_end_dot_

 they must if they are to feed their need for relevance and power _meta_end_dot_

 and despite their misgivings about mccain s stance on immigration and other issues they were always going to support him because he will be their party s nominee and because they value party above all else especially principle _meta_end_dot_

 and so today through the spittle and blustering aimed at the new york times we see that the inevitable is occurring _meta_end_dot_

 the radical right is predictably falling into form lining up behind their candidate ready to carry water and bury truth _meta_end_dot_

 ready to deflect and distort _meta_end_dot_

 and ready to act as they have always acted to win elections by raising hell and lowering discourse by attacking the media and backing the man who they believe can keep their party in power _meta_end_dot_
