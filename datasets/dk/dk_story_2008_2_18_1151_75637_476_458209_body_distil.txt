  let us be utterly clear on this point john mccain s efforts to paint barack obama into a corner on the issue of public financing for the general election constitute rank opportunism of the worst kind _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain only cares about public financing when it suits his political prospects _meta_end_dot_

 i alluded to it in my last story on this topic but loan documents now public on the fec s website make clear the extent of mccain s perfidy _meta_end_dot_

 here s the one you ll want to see and the wapo s matthew mosk gives the flyover yes dear readers mccain s chief counsel is the same trevor potter who argued before the fec that sites like this one should not be treated as media exempt campaign finance law so go to the third page of that document where at the bottom you ll see mccain agree that if he doesn t win new hampshire or place within ten points there i e if his campaign is dead he ll still stay in the race for another _meta_number_ref_ days reapply for public matching funds and use that money to pay off the loan _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to say two pages later that he agrees to stay within the limits to remain eligible for public financing modified pre nh to be won t break the limits without asking the bank first as cleta mitchell a veteran republican campaign finance lawyer put it in the wapo piece let s explain john mccain tried to use the public financing system only as a crutch in case his campaign tanked _meta_end_dot_

 if he bombed in new hampshire he d take our money to bail out his failed campaign otherwise he d pretend he never applied for and received a certificate guaranteeing him _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m _meta_end_dot_

 there is no principle involved whatsoever just a desire to game the system when it suits him _meta_end_dot_

 indeed back in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain voted to kill the presidential public financing program altogether and today refuses to back a bipartisan bill to bring public financing to senate and house elections _meta_end_dot_

 so the only reason mccain wants barack obama in the public financing system is because he knows that obama will obliterate him in general election fundraising otherwise and tapped s mark schmitt accurately captures the meaning of obama s pledge is john mccain interested in a real pledge _meta_end_question_

 would he agree to refund all federal lobbyist and pac money currently in his coffers should obama clinch the democratic nomination _meta_end_question_

 will he denounce the use of _meta_number_ref_ money on his behalf _meta_end_question_

 will he pledge to fix the presidential public financing system for future elections _meta_end_question_

 how many of the reforms to which obama committed in that midwest democracy network questionnaire will mccain pledge as well _meta_end_question_

 is john mccain sincerely interested in meaningful comprehensive campaign finance reform including a viable public financing system for all future elections or is he just trying to win this election by any means necessary _meta_end_question_

 or ask yourself this if the republican base were excited about mccain if he had even brought in as much from small dollar donors last year as folksy fred thompson do you think we would be having this conversation at all _meta_end_question_

 update mark schmitt took a look at the same documents i did and now has this to say
