  a key leader of the democratic congressional campaign committee by her own admission has a serious conflict of interest let s leave aside for a moment that the first part of this statement is incorrect the first round of red to blue challengers has already been announced _meta_end_dot_

 it s the second sentence that troubles me _meta_end_dot_

 debbie dubya co chairs the red to blue program _meta_end_dot_

 she has a major say in who gets tapped for it _meta_end_dot_

 yet here she is saying she wouldn t help three awesome candidates joe garcia raul martinez and annette taddeo if they get picked for that program _meta_end_dot_

 but if she s already so hostile to the idea of them running don t you think she might steer the d trip away from choosing any of these three for r to b status in the first place _meta_end_question_

 how can these three get a fair hearing _meta_end_question_

 this is a major conflict of interest one which threatens to hurt not just our south florida trio but the fortunes of the democratic party as well _meta_end_dot_

 i also think it undermines the dccc s broader efforts too for instance which other potential recruits might shy away from running if they thought that the scales were tipped against them _meta_end_question_

 as james hell said there are no recusals in politics _meta_end_dot_

 debbie dubya has to buck up heartily endorse all three candidates and throw fundraisers for each of them _meta_end_dot_

 if she can t do that then she is hopelessly unqualified to perform her job at the dccc _meta_end_dot_

 an enraged rahm emanuel once thundered w e ve got a republican target and you re out there kissing his ass in the press rahm didn t accept this kind of bullshit from alcee hastings and chris van hollen shouldn t accept it from debbie wasserman schultz _meta_end_dot_

 she needs to change her tune or take a seat on the bench _meta_end_dot_
