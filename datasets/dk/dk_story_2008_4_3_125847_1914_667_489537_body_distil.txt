  greenwald has a follow up post to the one i highlighted earlier examining the assertion michael mukasey made in a speech last week before the commonwealth club that somehow our intelligence community was unable to pursue a telephone call made by an al qaeda terrorist from a known safe house in afghanistan into the united states because of fisa thereby claiming that fisa was responsible for the deaths of thousands of americans on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 an assertion that is patently false as monitoring calls originating in a foreign country have never required a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 but there s more important aspects of this story _meta_end_dot_

 glenn greenwald asked _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission chairs hamilton and kean as well as director phillip zelikow for clarification about this story since it did not appear in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission report _meta_end_dot_

 hamilton refused comment and kean hasn t responded yet _meta_end_dot_

 but zelikow said this in other words as glenn says polite beltway talk for saying that nothing like what mukasey described actually happened of course there was plenty of information withheld by the administration with gonzales leading the obstruction charge _meta_end_dot_

 would they have withheld this nugget in an attempt to make them look a little less incompetent _meta_end_question_

 the intelligence failures in the days leading up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ are legion and every one of them an embarrassment to the administration _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps they didn t want to have one more damning incident _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps michael mukasey is a lying political hack trying to exploit the still gaping wound of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to secure his bosses greatest desire retroactive telecom amnesty that will also conveniently close the judicial book on this illegal program _meta_end_dot_

 we were better off with gonzales in many ways _meta_end_dot_

 at least we knew his default mode was lying _meta_end_dot_

 mukasey is more dangerous because he s respectable _meta_end_dot_

 but he s apparently as much of a lying hack and lackey as his predecessor _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of principle this congress should refuse to consider any more intelligence related legislation put forth by this administration particularly fisa _meta_end_dot_

 this administration and the two point men they have put in charge of their fisa case mukasey and dni mcconnell have proven time and time again to be outright liars to be so politically motivated in pursuing retroactive amnesty that they will say anything to gain leverage _meta_end_dot_

 at the very least there should be a complete moratorium on congressional action on any intelligence related matter particularly fisa until mukasey testifies before congressional committees about this assertion _meta_end_dot_

 update contact the congressional leadership and the chairs of the judiciary and intelligence committees to demand hearings to determine whether mukasey is telling the truth and whether there s more we need to know about fisa and intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 contact your own senators and representative too and ask them to demand answers before they vote on fisa
