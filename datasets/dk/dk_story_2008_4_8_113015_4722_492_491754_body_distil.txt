  think progress noted again on sunday that john mccain continues to repeat false statements about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 except al sadr didn t declare the ceasefire the maliki government brokered it _meta_end_dot_

 this is after fundamentally and repeatedly misstating i e _meta_end_dot_

 getting flat wrong basic facts about the dynamic between iraq iran and al qaeda and gets to the heart a certain press dynamic that i think is becoming more and more apparent as this race goes on aside from places like think progress media matters and the like has mccain got any substantial coverage anywhere detailing how something he said was false _meta_end_question_

 i m all for a harsh level of scrutiny for the candidates both democrats and the republicans it s the entire point of the press _meta_end_dot_

 an informed electorate cannot exist without it _meta_end_dot_

 but increasingly it seems that mccain is getting a very bush like free pass when it comes to his fabrications _meta_end_dot_

 m ccain has a history of false statements with regards to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but when mccain says something obviously false about iraq or iran about this cease fire etc _meta_end_dot_

 it s at worst labeled by reporters as a gaffe _meta_end_dot_

 a gaffe because he s just misspeaking or spinning or misremembered or let s say is not fully aware of the facts involved _meta_end_dot_

 it s very bushlike in terms of the media just doesn t expect him not to say false things especially on his self declared strong point foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 bush could say false things throughout his campaign and presidency because he was considered let s be honest dumb as a post _meta_end_dot_

 it was expected that he didn t understand some of the things he was saying or his blatantly false statements were pointed to as perfectly acceptable political spin evidence of a laudable tightly controlled message by the white house and at worst looked upon with little knowing smirks by the press corps covering them _meta_end_dot_

 obama would be squashed for saying such transparently false things for getting things as flagrantly wrong about basic aspects of foreign policy as mccain does on a repeated basis _meta_end_dot_

 if obama did it it d be damning evidence of inexperience a similar gaffe would set the narrative for the rest of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s being cut to ribbons over apparent falsehoods on her part the sniper thing is still going strong and is presumed much in the same dynamic as the gore campaign coverage to be a definitive measure of her character _meta_end_dot_

 at least in her case the things she s being hammered for saying are at least usually things she actually said as opposed to things reporters or right wing pundits imagined she said but with mccain his campaign trail misrepresentations are covered by places like think progress but those now frequent falsehoods aren t defining the character of the man in the papers and on the networks _meta_end_dot_

 even though or perhaps because his statements are blatant denials of actual current world facts it hardly seems to tarnish his image _meta_end_dot_

 eyebrow raising but not entirely surprising _meta_end_dot_

 as i said it seems very similar to the treatment bush has received the past eight years _meta_end_dot_
