  we ve seen the narrative take shape on the republican side of the michigan contest _meta_end_dot_

 what about the dems _meta_end_question_

 skeptics of the dems for mitt maneuver insisted that if the crossover voters had picked up dem ballots and voted uncommitted the state would deliver a stinging rebuke to clinton that would echo across the country _meta_end_dot_

 truth be told if the crossover voters had done just that they d have reduced clinton s margin of victory from _meta_number_ref_ points to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not much chance of changing the narrative _meta_end_dot_

 and what is that narrative _meta_end_question_

 it s a mixed bag at best _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand _meta_end_dot_

 arizona daily star clinton s michigan win virtually uncontested detroit news clinton coasts to democratic victory boston globe clinton wins largely uncontested michigan primary fox news hillary wins uncontested michigan primary upi clinton romney take michigan primaries port huron mi times herald clinton wins on short ballot and on the other _meta_end_dot_

 grand rapids press _meta_number_ref_ percent of democrats vote uncommitted washington post _meta_number_ref_ percent vote against clinton the nation michigan s ominous message for hillary clinton detroit free press clinton fends off uncommitted detroit free press confusion wins in democratic vote but sometimes you had to dig deep into the paper to get these messages _meta_end_dot_

 dfm skeptics also assured us that while the national press might not all necessarily echo the clinton s hollow victory line surely the michigan press would lead the way and some would take their cues from the locals _meta_end_dot_

 that just doesn t appear to be the case for the most part _meta_end_dot_

 was the michigan media s message on clinton just not clear enough to be heard _meta_end_question_

 or was there no penetrating message at all _meta_end_question_

 you tell me
