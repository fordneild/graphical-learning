  the doctor is in remember the peanuts comic strips where lucy sat under a sign that said psychiatric help _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 while the doctor is out i ve borrowed her booth and i m here to answer your non mathematics questions about delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but before i do that let me try to preempt some of your questions which will in the process probably just prompt new questions which you hadn t previously considered _meta_end_dot_

 before i do some q and a let s start with an excerpt from a brief primer on delegates i posted a few days ago ok now that we ve reviewed some of the basics let s go over some questions _meta_end_dot_

 how did they come up with these delegate counts for each state _meta_end_question_

 iowa and connecticut have similar populations why does iowa get _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates and connecticut _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 pledged delegates are apportioned to states using a formula that factors in the number of electoral votes plus the number of votes for the democratic presidential nominee in the last two elections _meta_end_dot_

 more democratic states get more delegates _meta_end_dot_

 ok then that explains why dc gets _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates and wyoming only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but why does south dakota get _meta_number_ref_ and montana get _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 ah good question _meta_end_dot_

 it s because the dnc calculated the delegates to leave a couple dozen left over which they used as an inducement to keep every state from rushing forward to be part of super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 the ten states and territories with primaries or caucuses in april or later get bonus delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that means more influence and more people who get to go to the convention with delegate credentials so they can wear stupid hats and not hear what s being said from the stage _meta_end_dot_

 wait what s that _meta_end_question_

 territories _meta_end_question_

 puerto rico all get votes for our nominee and send delegates to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 there s also a group called democrats abroad for dems around the globe _meta_end_dot_

 these territories and dems abroad also get slots on committees such as the credentials committee and the platform committee _meta_end_dot_

 their votes however are fractional and not worth as much as delegates from states and the district of columbia which all have electoral votes in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of the credentials committee isn t that the committee that will decide whether the michigan and florida delegations get seated at the convention _meta_end_question_

 yes but that s a big enough subject to warrant a piece by itself _meta_end_dot_

 i ll post one later this week _meta_end_dot_

 but at least tell me this the delegates currently require _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes does that include the delegates from mi and fl _meta_end_question_

 no mi and fl are not factored in to the current totals _meta_end_dot_

 alright a question about totals why does every place i look have different delegate totals _meta_end_question_

 short answer is that many in the media are nitwits and are mixing apples and anvils _meta_end_dot_

 remember upthread where i explained the difference between pledged delegates and unpledged delegates _meta_end_question_

 what s going on is that a bunch of media outlets are combining the totals of pledged delegates which is a discernable and eventually unambiguous number with unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 unpledged delegates can say one thing and do another at the convention so in my opinion they should be tallied separate from the pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but why are even the pledged delegate totals often different _meta_end_question_

 a few reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first because of the proportional allocation of delegates until votes are certified you don t necessarily know who got how many delegates _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore technically the delegates in most caucus states aren t finally determined for a couple months after the caucus _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt had a good discussion of these vagaries yesterday you should check it out _meta_end_dot_

 will either candidate get enough pledged delegates to officially lock up the nomination before the convention _meta_end_question_

 if one of the candidates goes on a run and wins contest after contests there s certainly a possibility of a deal so we ll get a de facto nominee before denver _meta_end_dot_

 but mathematically it s highly unlikely that either candidate will have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates before the convention _meta_end_dot_

 so that means the unpledged delegates can overturn the will of the people at the convention _meta_end_question_

 hold on there _meta_end_dot_

 how do you determine the will of the people in this kind of contest _meta_end_question_

 we ve had open primaries we ve had closed primaries primaries where republicans could vote others where only dems and independents could vote but not republicans caucuses with a wide range of rules and these contests are spread out over _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way to compare popular votes _meta_end_dot_

 so one can t easily know if the system doesn t reflect majority will like you can if the winner of the popular vote loses the electoral college _meta_end_dot_

 ok whatever but the question remains can t the unpledged delegates thwart the decisions of the voters and overturn the results of the primaries and caucuses _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates are unpledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if i had to put money on it right now i d say that obama will arrive in denver without enough pledged delegates to lock up the nomination but only needing a couple hundred or fewer unpledged delegates to get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 of course michigan and florida could really complicate this all of this and in case you re wondering the unpledged delegates are not currently slated to be seated at the convention but there s also the chance that mi and fl will have to conduct new contests _meta_end_dot_

 i know i said i wouldn t discuss mi and fl but the way to think about this isn t that the unpledged delegates will chose the nominee but that the nominee in order to secure the nomination will require some his nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but doesn t it suck that people we didn t elect will have that much power _meta_end_question_

 i m only here to explain the process today _meta_end_dot_

 but it is the process and it s not going to change this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 if people didn t like it the time to change it was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll say this _meta_end_dot_

 most unpledged delegates are elected officials _meta_end_dot_

 as elected officials they live or die politically by keeping large or key blocs of voters and influential people happy _meta_end_dot_

 most of the people at dkos who are preemptively screaming about the unpledged delegates screwing us are obama folks and i think it strains credulity to think that if obama continues to gain momentum and raise more money than clinton if he continues to win most contests and he goes in to denver having opened a gap on clinton and looks like the stronger candidate in november that the unpledged delegates will coalesce to back clinton over obama _meta_end_dot_

 most of them would face a revolt back home if they did that _meta_end_dot_

 besides don t overestimate the influence of the clintons among party leadership _meta_end_dot_

 some love them _meta_end_dot_

 some would love to see someone different _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want to influence the unpledged delegates from your state figure out an effective way to get your voice heard and maybe even heeded _meta_end_dot_

 well at least tell me this much is that weasel joe lieberman an unpledged delegate _meta_end_question_

 we may have a screwed up system but there s a great rule in the dnc bylaws that unpledged delegates can endorse or not endorse anyone they want as long as it s not a candidate from another party _meta_end_dot_

 when joementum endorsed mccain he broke that rule and is no longer an unpledged delegate _meta_end_dot_

 so we at least have that rule that we can all agree worked brilliantly _meta_end_dot_
