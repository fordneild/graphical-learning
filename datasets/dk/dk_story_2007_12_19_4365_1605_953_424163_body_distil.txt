  yesterday twenty one democratic senators joined their republican brethren and voted to hand george bush another blank check for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because if you ignore the fact that every benchmark laid out by bush has failed we re winning _meta_end_dot_

 and with only forty or so soldiers dying in iraq every month what better way to support the troops than voting to keep them there indefinitely _meta_end_question_

 well not all of the troops because just since that magical september _meta_number_ref_ soldiers from these democratic senators home states have died _meta_end_dot_

 and when these senators defend their vote will they remember those men and women _meta_end_question_

 senators lincoln and pryor remember senator salazar remember senator bill nelson remember senators akaka and inouye remember senator bayh remember senator landrieu remember senator mikulski remember senator levin remember senators baucus and tester remember senator mccaskill remember bob casey remember senator tim johnson remember senator rockefeller remember senator webb remember so when these senators explain their vote by saying progress is on the march ask them if they remember the men and women who continue to die everyday for george bush s war and for their capitulation _meta_end_dot_
