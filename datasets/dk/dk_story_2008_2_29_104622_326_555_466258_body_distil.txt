  the special election in indiana s democratic _meta_number_ref_th district is now less than two weeks away and we have good news and bad news _meta_end_dot_

 the good news such as it is is that the latest poll on the race has democrat andre carson up big _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over republican jon elrod _meta_end_dot_

 however i m not that excited about these results because i m not sure how reliable the poll is _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing it s a pretty small sample _meta_number_ref_ likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 for another the poll has a large margin of error of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and finally it just has a lot of results i find hard to believe _meta_end_dot_

 the poll also shows governor mitch daniels with _meta_number_ref_ point leads over his democratic opponents which is radically different from any other polling i ve seen _meta_end_dot_

 it shows andre carson with _meta_percent_ref_ name id and with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ favorable unfavorables among democrats _meta_end_dot_

 i find those numbers quite hard to believe _meta_end_dot_

 still the results are nice _meta_end_dot_

 the cook political report however is not sanguine about our chances here _meta_end_dot_

 they have downgraded this race from likely democratic to leans democratic the mirror of il _meta_number_ref_ which is now lean republican as opposed to likely republican _meta_end_dot_

 that s not the end of the world and i m not surprised indiana republicans have been going hard after this seat but it s still cause for concern _meta_end_dot_

 carson is still favored he s raised five times what elrod has raised and i d expect him to win _meta_end_dot_

 but this race is miles from a sure thing _meta_end_dot_

 the good people at blue indiana have been covering this race extensively including a gem on jon elrod s bizarre priorities such as seemingly ignoring iraq on his website as well as a fun piece about the lame attempts of conservative bloggers to try and make scandals up out of whole cloth _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned with this election on the _meta_number_ref_th and illinois _meta_number_ref_th district special on the _meta_number_ref_th things are about to get real interesting _meta_end_dot_
