  the latest in the disgusting story of longtime racist geraldine ferraro hey former congresswoman ferraro i ve got a message for you from the _meta_number_ref_st century it s not ok to be sexist or racist _meta_end_dot_

 it s not ok to create a hierarchy of persecution and apply it to democratic politics _meta_end_dot_

 it s not ok to imply as you ve seemed to be implying in recent days that because women supposedly have it harder that hillary clinton should get an easier path or that it s ok to denigrate barack obama s achievements by characterizing them as arising from advantages supposedly afforded to african americans _meta_end_dot_

 there s also this reaction from clinton campaign manager maggie williams when john edwards and the other candidates were still in the race legitimate questions raised about hillary clinton were characterized by her campaign as examples of the male candidates ganging up on clinton as if she should be measured by different rules because she was a woman _meta_end_dot_

 since these arguments were advanced on behalf of the same person who was claiming that only she was experienced enough and tough enough to be commander in chief reporters and voters couldn t be convinced to see her as the tender woman under assault from the testosterone addled brutes _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign eventually abandoned that calumny _meta_end_dot_

 ferraro is reprising the same tactic but with a twist _meta_end_dot_

 she s fusing the politics of gender bias with a resentment of racial integration that glides imperceptibly past many people but like a dog whistle delivers its message on a frequency that many older white voters hear acutely _meta_end_dot_

 it s not legitimate for barack obama to question or challenge hillary clinton implies ferraro not only because hillary is a woman and women take too much crap from men but also and this is crucial because barack obama is a black guy and the elites in their nice homes with their fancy degrees are once again taking something away from us that we worked hard to earn and they re giving it away on a silver platter to some young black guy _meta_end_dot_

 ferraro is playing a feminist george wallace _meta_end_dot_

 wallace appealed to insecure whites who felt that their struggles and hard work entitled them to live in all white neighborhoods and elitist judges shouldn t be able to force them to accept black neighbors and integrated schools _meta_end_dot_

 ferraro is trying to appeal to insecure white women who believe they ve put in their time and now they re entitled to get their woman president and nobody should be allowed to take away their presidency and give it to the black guy who hasn t earned it _meta_end_dot_

 when obama rejects racist garbage put forth by a clintonite the clinton campaign attacks obama for supposedly making the campaign personal and nasty _meta_end_dot_

 the tender woman line didn t work by itself _meta_end_dot_

 but the tender woman under assault from the black man that hadn t yet been tried so geraldine ferraro is giving it a whirl and hillary clinton s response is a tepid it s regrettable paired with the false claim that both sides are doing it _meta_end_dot_

 we democrats with the evident exception of geraldine ferraro and possibly some members of the clinton braintrust are better than this _meta_end_dot_

 we have evolved to the point where a woman and an african american are competing for our presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i m happy to be supporting the candidate who is likely to stave off a tough challenge from a formidable rival and become our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 geraldine ferraro is angry because she believes the woman she supports is entitled to the nomination but her black rival is not _meta_end_dot_

 i want the person i believe is our best candidate to earn our nomination _meta_end_dot_

 geraldine ferraro wants the woman to get the nomination instead of the black guy _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton says ferraro s comments are regrettable _meta_end_dot_

 i think clinton should declare that the attitudes and beliefs underlying ferraro s comments are repugnant _meta_end_dot_
