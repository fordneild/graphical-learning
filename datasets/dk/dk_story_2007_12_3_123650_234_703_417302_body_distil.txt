  while he was in san francisco last week congressman and colorado senate candidate mark udall met with a packed room of democratic activists including kos and gave what markos says was an excellent talk _meta_end_dot_

 the turnout was very good helped no doubt by markos pumping up the event in a post which tweaked the nrsc for their tired and witless attacks on san francisco liberals he had extra fun with this post from the nrsc s blog on friday the nrsc seized what they thought was an opportunity i don t make a habit of believing the nrsc so in fact i did look it up _meta_end_dot_

 i looked it up in the oxford english dictionary _meta_end_dot_

 all but two of the usage examples were from the _meta_number_ref_th century by the likes of jeremy bentham and orestes brownson _meta_end_dot_

 so yeah it s a word it s an infrequently used synonym of liberal _meta_end_dot_

 but it s anachronistic which is apt since the republican party would like to return the country back to the days before roe v wade before griswold before brown v board of education to the good old days before the embrace of the new deal maybe to the lochner era maybe even the republican heyday of the gilded age _meta_end_dot_

 so the nrsc proved liberalist is a word _meta_end_dot_

 however they also proved that whoever controls their blog needs remedial grammar classes _meta_end_dot_

 just because liberalist is in the dictionary doesn t mean they used it properly _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 liberalist as an adjective pertains to liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 it does not signify a degree or intensity of liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 it is not in other words a superlative _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 look it up you know what a superlative is _meta_end_dot_

 for instance look at the comparative and superlative s of stupid stupider and stupidest _meta_end_dot_

 it was stupid of the nrsc to waste a bunch of money in _meta_number_ref_ trying to defeat debbie stabenow who won easily _meta_end_dot_

 it was stupider to waste even more money trying to defeat bob menendez who also won easily _meta_end_dot_

 but the stupidest thing the nrsc did was to not put more money in to montana and virginia where a little extra spending might have kept tester and webb from winning close elections _meta_end_dot_

 stupid stupider stupidest _meta_end_dot_

 now try that with liberal _meta_end_dot_

 you can t because the comparative and superlative of liberal aren t liberal liberaler liberalest _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there are no such words as liberaler or liberalest the comparative and superlative of liberal and that s what the nrsc was trying to convey are more liberal most liberal _meta_end_dot_

 the difference here is the suffix _meta_end_dot_

 superlatives have est endings _meta_end_dot_

 now admittedly this is pedantic _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also amusing and more than a tad pathetic because at a time when just about every indication is that the republicans might be facing their worst election since _meta_number_ref_ that there are strong parallels to _meta_number_ref_ and senate election experts suggest the possibility that the republicans could lose up to nine seats next november giving democrats a filibuster proof majority the nrsc is using its blog to tout their ignorance of grammar _meta_end_dot_

 hint to the nrsc before flying off the handle and making yourselves look like fools for the third time try doing your homework first _meta_end_dot_

 update thanks to gchaucher_meta_number_ref_ for pointing out my failure to note the comparative form before the superlative form update _meta_number_ref_ as dss points out there s no entry for liberalist in the conservapedia _meta_end_dot_
