  from email press release the complaint further alleges that some reichert donors have contributed more than the allowed limit but what struck me most was that number the bush fundraiser looks to have raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for reichert _meta_end_dot_

 we in the netroots raised about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in our counter fundraiser for darcy burner _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the president of the united states was able to raise only about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more than us _meta_end_dot_

 throw in the pr hit reichert took by having to do an event with mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ and now their problems with the fec over their fundraising lies and obfuscations and suddenly you see the whole affair being a huge disaster for the gop _meta_end_dot_
