  in the year _meta_number_ref_ a devastating blow was dealt to conservative ideology _meta_end_dot_

 they were at long last given simultaneous control of all parts of government and a chance to implement their philosophies _meta_end_dot_

 the outcome proved of course to be a fiasco of monumental proportions _meta_end_dot_

 from budget surpluses to record deficits unchecked pork a tide of corruption both moral and legal that thinned their ranks like smallpox mismanagement of even basic government tasks such as emergency response capabilities a national economy constantly teetering between mere sluggishness and outright recession the entrance into a quagmire of a war one with unclear initial purpose and even less clear strategies for exit _meta_end_dot_

 and those are just the highlights _meta_end_dot_

 it would be enough to drive even the most sane person to despair in fact the more sane you are the more likely you are to feel despair over any of these things _meta_end_dot_

 with the agonizing lack of grace of a faceplanting pole vaulter and in every realm economics oversight foreign policy etc _meta_end_dot_

 conservatism unleashed into the real world met once again with abject and humiliating failure _meta_end_dot_

 it seems there is no aspect of government that conservatism is actually good at once the adherents are given any more responsibilities than being the besuited blowhards of washington cocktail parties _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it might be appropriate at this point to go over the five conservative stages of grief _meta_end_dot_

 they are taken directly from kubler ross and so are solidly backed by the best psychological modeling _meta_end_dot_

 in their moments of understandable despair over actually having finally been given the unfair and dastardly opportunity to put their signing pens where their mouths have been as opposed the previous years of merely erupting geyserlike on fox news every evening about what they could do if they were in charge it is expected that most conservatives will at this point go through at least some of these stages of grief _meta_end_dot_

 since we are not ogres here we will simply wish them well and pray for their speedy recovery _meta_end_dot_

 stage _meta_number_ref_ john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in the mccain stage of grief a conservative is mentally aware of their surroundings but unable to emotionally process the information _meta_end_dot_

 the result is a mental short circuit _meta_end_dot_

 sufferers are especially prone to thinking that the iraq war is going spectacularly well they may even wander open air marketplaces in which they are protected by a hundred or more fully armed united states soldiers with helicopter gunship support and remark aloud at how normal and stable and safe their location obviously is _meta_end_dot_

 denial may also exist over the state of the economy of their own party or especially their own past actions _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain stage of grief is known to last years or even decades _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately the sufferer usually loses all concept of time such that they cannot differentiate between any particular six month period and will eventually declare them all to be a hundred years long _meta_end_dot_

 stage _meta_number_ref_ rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 the giuliani stage of grief is marked by constant seething anger _meta_end_dot_

 individuals may reduce their entire range of emotional responses to one that of constant self righteous rage _meta_end_dot_

 the stage is usually accompanied by napoleonic fantasies declaring the fearsome breadth of their own inner fury to be the only salvation not just of themselves but of the entire world in which they live _meta_end_dot_

 every situation every social interaction and every problem is met with a frequently irrational and always militant response _meta_end_dot_

 long term sufferers of the giuliani stage may eventually suffer from a permanent bug eyed expression and the onset of sociopathy _meta_end_dot_

 they may sometimes be mistaken for necrophiliacs _meta_end_dot_

 stage _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 in the romney stage the full impact of the conservative situation begins to become clear to the individual who then begins to attempt to extricate themselves from their predicament through the process of bargaining _meta_end_dot_

 sufferers may upon recognizing the unpopularity of past positions shift those positions wildly from one year to the next one week to the next or even during consecutive sentences _meta_end_dot_

 they are driven by a need for popularity and acceptance and are willing to tailor their speech behavior and even their thoughts to whatever may be necessary to obtain it _meta_end_dot_

 sufferers of the romney stage of grief are aware of their surroundings and the negative situation they are in and are even aware of how their behavior may have contributed to the failure but lack the mental ability to then adapt their behaviors as a result of those past failures _meta_end_dot_

 instead they flit haphazardly from idea to idea from constituency to constituency looking to empty sloganeering and focus group ideas to rebuild the trust that they have lost _meta_end_dot_

 stage _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 eventually sufferers of conservative grief may become distant and despondent entering the thompson stage _meta_end_dot_

 individuals may retreat into isolation even if they are currently supposed to be running for president of the united states or something _meta_end_dot_

 while they can sometimes be goaded into action say for an evening debate they are more prone to minimalist activities such as making a few phone calls showing up at a county fair or merely driving around in a truck _meta_end_dot_

 sufferers of the thompson stage are fully aware of past conservative failures but are unable to make even token attempts at new ideas or substantively critiquing the old ones _meta_end_dot_

 they become stiff and emotionless as if a writers strike is incapacitating them _meta_end_dot_

 they may begin to age creepily and horribly _meta_end_dot_

 stage _meta_number_ref_ mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 finally the huckabee stage may be reached _meta_end_dot_

 in this stage the grief sufferer finally comes to term with the situation for himself and his fellow conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he realizes fully how he has been used he realizes fully how shallow and insincere conservative behavior has been he realizes that there is little way to change the situation _meta_end_dot_

 he may surround himself with trivialities or attempts at obvious self deprecation in order to make light of the situation for example using elderly b list television action stars as inexplicable campaign props _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless acceptance of the situation is achieved _meta_end_dot_

 in the huckabee stage the individual no longer grieves for the losses of conservatism but comes to accept them as the reality of the movement and nothing that either can or should be changed _meta_end_dot_

 token apologies for past behavior may be issued with the full internal knowledge that those transgressions will be repeated in the future _meta_end_dot_

 individuals that reach the huckabethan stage of conservative grief may achieve serenity and spirituality the stage is frequently accompanied by the belief that no matter how bad the situation is those tragedies and failures were preordained by god who will return at any moment to kick the asses of all those that may now stand in your way _meta_end_dot_

 these seemingly baseless assertions of preordained destiny and of imminent divine intervention on your personal behalf may not be emotionally rational but it at least allows the individual a cognitive basis for continuing their conservatism even in the wake of obvious and dramatic movement wide failures _meta_end_dot_

 in this manner a conservative can continue to remain conservative indefinitely or at least until their conservatism results in another multi fronted national crisis _meta_end_dot_
