  the dccc has released its list of targeted races for the _meta_number_ref_ cycle and it is manna from heaven for horserace junkies and really all democrats who want to feel optimistic about this fall _meta_end_dot_

 they have targeted _meta_number_ref_ republican held seats up to this point as well as identifying _meta_number_ref_ democratic held seats where they ll be focusing on defense _meta_end_dot_

 i ve posted the full lists below along with some commentary _meta_end_dot_

 as the lists are so long i have focused primarily on the races which i was most surprised to see on the list i ll be posting more on the target list next week _meta_end_dot_

 as usual with lists such as these caveats apply _meta_end_dot_

 first it is likely that the dccc will ultimately be involved in several races not on these list just as it is likely that some of these races will not ultimately be receiving heavy attention from the national party _meta_end_dot_

 second the dccc will be focusing predominantly on its red to blue races of which we should see more over the next several months _meta_end_dot_

 that said here s the list _meta_end_dot_

 an asterisk denotes an open seat denotes a red to blue candidate and italics indicate a blue majority candidate in which case i ve also posted the name of the opposing candidate _meta_end_dot_
