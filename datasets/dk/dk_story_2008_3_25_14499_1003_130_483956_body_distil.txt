  remember clinton s baseline is about _meta_number_ref_ points in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results could be just statistical noise from the last edition though back on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton had a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lead in this poll _meta_end_dot_

 this on the other hand seems more significant to me could the bosnia lie be a factor here _meta_end_question_

 this poll was conducted yesterday so perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 more interestingly is that obama hasn t suffered his favorability ratings despite the wright mess _meta_end_dot_

 chances are those numbers would ve looked differently had this thing been polled last week _meta_end_dot_

 but apparently obama has made up whatever ground he lost _meta_end_dot_

 then there s this that s mostly bluster _meta_end_dot_

 the majority of democrats will vote for the democrat _meta_end_dot_

 likewise no matter how much conservative talk radio hosts bitch about mccain the majority of republicans will vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 the big question isn t who will vote for who but how much effort they ll put into getting their candidate elected _meta_end_dot_

 mccain inspires little excitement _meta_end_dot_

 and the way this democratic nomination is going the increasing bitterness will likely dampen some of the enthusiasm on our side _meta_end_dot_

 and that will be particularly pronounced if we see a coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_
