  yesterday s senate judiciary committee mark up produced some surprising results _meta_end_dot_

 christy hardin smith at firedoglake has a good run down of what happened and what it might mean _meta_end_dot_

 but the quick nutshell version is this the senate intelligence committee rolled over for bush and reported out a fisa bill that includes all the worst of what he s demanding retroactive amnesty for phone company lawbreakers basket warrants that facilitate exactly the type of wholesale data mining everyone thought died with total information awareness and weak or non existent minimization requirements so that all that data on ordinary americans that gets scooped up along the way can be sliced diced and stored for later re education efforts matters of national security the bill then got sent to the senate judiciary committee where chairman pat leahy pulled a big league move and reported the bill out without title ii in it which is where the immunity provisions were stashed _meta_end_dot_

 that set the bill up for floor action in a posture that would require amnesty supporters to stand up and be seen adding it back in on the floor rather than relying on the less transparent committee process and then throwing their hands up with a what can you do shrug _meta_end_dot_

 good news _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t settle matters _meta_end_dot_

 in the world of senate arcana anything can still happen _meta_end_dot_

 depending on what harry reid wants to do he could _meta_number_ref_ claim the intelligence version of the bill is the real one and bring that up _meta_number_ref_ claim the judiciary version is the one that counts _meta_number_ref_ opt to vote on the house passed restore act that has no amnesty in it _meta_number_ref_ cobble together something entirely different perhaps composed from parts of all three _meta_end_dot_

 it s still wide open _meta_end_dot_

 that may not be much help in figuring out exactly what s going to happen but that s the point _meta_end_dot_

 we re still a long way from done _meta_end_dot_

 this might be revealing though commenters in the firedoglake thread report seeing harry reid on c span saying he intends to bring the intelligence committee version to the floor with the judiciayr committee version offered as a substitute _meta_end_dot_

 that reverses the work done by leahy and company yesterday and makes the version including amnesty the presumptive winner forcing opponents to work to take it out _meta_end_dot_

 bad news for fans of spine _meta_end_dot_

 update if true reid s option to bring the intel version to the floor would also bring us back to square one with dodd s hold _meta_end_dot_
