  george bush has signed into law s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a bill that strengthens the freedom of information act _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of signs that bush did not much like this open government act so it s significant that he didn t veto it _meta_end_dot_

 what are the signs of bush s displeasure _meta_end_question_

 for one thing the wh published a description of the new law that is terse and rather glaringly excludes most of its more important provisions _meta_end_dot_

 you ll find these spelled out in some detail in the crs summary of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 as a point of comparison let s look at which elements the associated press chose to include in its summary of the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 according to ap the new law by contrast the published wh summary mentions only that the law amends foia by you ll note that there s barely any overlap between the elements that the ap and the white house highlight _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the four elements listed by the wh say virtually nothing about the need or the mechanisms for greater openness the very goal of the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 as the ap describes it even if the open government act is not a cure for all of foia s ills it is a highly symbolic piece of legislation _meta_end_dot_

 and it s hard to ignore the symbolism of the manner in which bush signed it into law on new year s eve without comment _meta_end_dot_

 it was almost as if bush wanted to avoid drawing attention to a victory for government transparency _meta_end_dot_
