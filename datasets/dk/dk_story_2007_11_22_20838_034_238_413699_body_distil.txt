  if it was anybody but larry craig you might have some sympathy for the guy particularly seeing the picture that accompanies this story of course what craig had to say about global warming is less the story than his having to wait to say it but if you re curious huffpo covered it earlier in the month _meta_end_dot_

 larry craig is biding his time actively working in his committees and after a two month break is back on the senate floor making speeches _meta_end_dot_

 he s also remaining a thorn in the side of his leadership mcconnell refuses to speak about him on the record but is finidng an unlikely ally in an as usual wrong headed battle yes the _meta_number_ref_ mining act a law that hasn t been significantly altered in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the house passed the hardrock mining and reclamation act on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation would end royalty free hard rock mining of public lands and funnel money into reclaiming abandoned mines and community assistance meaning that the public would finally be compensated for the profits the mining industry has reaped off of public lands and that compensation would be the restoration and cleanup of those lands _meta_end_dot_

 reid has stated that reforming the law is necessary but that he doesn t support many of the provisions of what is a tough and responsible reform bill _meta_end_dot_

 given craig s long history of working against just about any conservation of public lands in the west reid s choosing him as an ally in this effort is not encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile back in idaho one gets the sense that the idaho gop is holding its collective breath afraid of doing or saying anything to get craig s back up _meta_end_dot_

 their worst fear has to be his getting so pissed off that he issues the ultimate fu and just decides he wants to keep that seat _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t put it past him and apparently neither would the idaho gop _meta_end_dot_
