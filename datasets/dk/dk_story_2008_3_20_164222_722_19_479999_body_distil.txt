  apparently the dscc chairmanship was considered a lousy and thankless job when chuck schumer took over in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but after a highly successful election cycle in _meta_number_ref_ and a generally outstanding recruiting job this year the future is looking so bright for senate democrats that schumer is considering staying for a third cycle as dscc chair schumer has become one of the highest ranking democrats in the senate and received considerable praise for his stewardship of the dscc in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s no longer doing this job to raise his already high profile _meta_end_dot_

 he s considering sticking around because he apparently feels he can continue to build on the success he had in _meta_number_ref_ and expects this year _meta_end_dot_

 hell with _meta_number_ref_ republicans up in _meta_number_ref_ against _meta_number_ref_ democrats a _meta_number_ref_ seat majority in _meta_number_ref_ does seem plausible _meta_end_dot_

 while republicans are retiring left and right schumer who nearly retired himself after _meta_number_ref_ in order to run for governor has big dreams for the next cycle _meta_end_dot_

 he s having so much fun it seems that he is considering another cycle in a job he didn t especially want three years ago _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of excitement and enthusiasm is nice to see _meta_end_dot_
