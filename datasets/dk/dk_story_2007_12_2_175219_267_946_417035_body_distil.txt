  a couple weeks ago i looked at the possibility that the _meta_number_ref_ election could be a huge and transforming election similar to the _meta_number_ref_ democratic landslide that brought in fdr and led to the solidification of the new deal electoral coalition of southern white protestants northern ethnic catholics african americans and union members that dominated american elections for decades _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ as the wall street crash led to the early days of the great depression democrats won big _meta_end_dot_

 just like _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_number_ref_ election ended _meta_number_ref_ years of republican control in both chambers of congress _meta_end_dot_

 just like in _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_number_ref_ election was a massive repudiation of the republican party and the performance of it s deeply unpopular president who had two years remaining in his term _meta_end_dot_

 so could the trend continue with the _meta_number_ref_ election being not an isolated peak but the first of two massive democratic landslides _meta_end_question_

 could we win the presidency and significantly add to our congressional margins while most likely sweeping democrats in to offices up and down the ballot _meta_end_question_

 at this point all indications are that we very well might _meta_end_dot_

 as discussed in part _meta_number_ref_ of this essay partisan divisions and tactical elections had led to several consecutive close elections _meta_end_dot_

 the country was ripe for a big swing against one of the parties _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike most previous swings against a party there was little chance of a dem backlash because the party that got pounded still controlled the white house and the president remains deeply unpopular _meta_end_dot_

 whereas some experts might look at the historical record and expect a swing back against the democrats or at least no major gains in _meta_number_ref_ i think the historical record suggests it s more likely that _meta_number_ref_ was simply the first stage of at least a two stage major congressional realignment especially since in _meta_number_ref_ the republicans were protecting few open seats but retirements are leaving competitive gop held seats without an incumbent _meta_end_dot_

 in the presidential race the first since _meta_number_ref_ without an incumbent or an outgoing vice president on the ticket we could also have a decisive and possibly even blowout victory _meta_end_dot_

 this scenario may not play out but with the economy now teetering on the brink of a recession it s likely the republicans woes will get worse _meta_end_dot_

 anyone paying attention to the news over the last several months has seen story after story about how the leading democrats running for president consistently poll ahead of the republicans in head to head matchups _meta_end_dot_

 generic ballots show wide democratic leads _meta_end_dot_

 and the democrats are destroying the republicans in the money race which if it continues which is likely will take away what typically has been one of the republicans major advantages _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the deeper numbers _meta_end_question_

 the trends in congressional races the other money races the issue polling the generic ballots and party identification _meta_end_question_

 just about every measure you can find points to major democratic gains in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 democracy corps provides some of the best data and analysis for house watchers because in addition to national and single state or district polling they also poll in _meta_number_ref_ competitive congressional districts _meta_number_ref_ held by democrats _meta_number_ref_ held by republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this was their read on the state of play as of a few months ago one of the keys to the _meta_number_ref_ wave was democratic success in hitting republicans hard in their second tier and even in some of those seats they never expected to have to contest _meta_end_dot_

 not only does that spread gop resources more thinly than they would want it also imposes on incumbents the need to campaign and fight hard _meta_end_dot_

 often these incumbents have never had to fight hard against a democrat or they may have lost the fire in their belly _meta_end_dot_

 in his infamous power point presentation to the general services administration karl rove identified six congressional race in which he attributed the gop loss in part to complacent incumbents if democracy corps is correct and democrats will be able to go hunting for seats in previously uncontested congressional districts they will surprise some complacent incumbents but they ll also find several open seats because republicans are now retiring at a much faster rate than they did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 retirements are contributing greatly to the equally promising situation in the senate as this article from september explained
