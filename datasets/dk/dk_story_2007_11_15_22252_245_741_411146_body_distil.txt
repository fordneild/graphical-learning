 sorry this last thread started at such an awkward moment so use it for your post chat too _meta_end_dot_

 standard post debate caveats winning a primary debate is a tricky question and it s not a zero sum game like a general election debate more than one person can win in the sense of doing what they need to do to help their campaign gain some traction _meta_end_dot_

 but taking into account home runs hit errors and general meh who do you think comes out of this debate most ahead of where they went in _meta_end_question_

 is it the person you supported going in _meta_end_question_

 did you actually change your candidate preference due to this debate do you think your candidate won or are you sticking with your candidate while thinking someone else did better _meta_end_question_

 a poll can t capture all of that so just let us know who you thought won but talk about the other stuff and whatever else you want in the comments _meta_end_dot_

 update and the cnn pundits decree _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 jc watts _meta_beep_ref_ agreed _meta_end_dot_

 carville is surprised that the fireworks were in the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s because the early questions were designed to invite attacks jackass anyway i m not agreeing or disagreeing with this consensus just throwing it out there _meta_end_dot_

 as we saw last time these snap media judgments have a big effect _meta_end_dot_

 the narrative coming out of the last debate was that hillary equivocates and is weak _meta_end_dot_

 and sure enough that was the media narrative for two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 will hillary rights the ship be the new narrative _meta_end_question_

 sounds like it _meta_end_dot_

 my editorial judgment is that wolf blitzer is a superficial twit _meta_end_dot_
