  mccain may have just been side swiped _meta_end_dot_

 the ny times is reporting that several former aides claim that mccain was suspected of having an intimate relationship with telecom lobbyist vicki iseman during his _meta_number_ref_ campaign for president _meta_end_dot_

 the maverick may have been cheating on his wife and voters all at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 how long before mccain is forced to make a i did not have sex with that woman type statement _meta_end_question_

 or worse yet a confession _meta_end_question_

 as of now they are both denying the story _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of whether they were having an intimate affair or not didn t john mccain realize that it was inappropriate for a telecommunications lobbyist to be turning up with him at fund raisers in his offices and aboard a client s corporate jet how could he not realize how inappropriate that is on a variety of levels _meta_end_question_

 but this isn t the first time that john mccain used poor judgement when it comes to lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 and it wouldn t be the first time by his own admission that he cheated on his wife _meta_end_dot_

 he married his current wife cindy only one month after he divorced his first wife _meta_end_dot_

 you d think that he would have learned his lesson by now _meta_end_dot_

 particularly after he had this to say in his memoir via nyt it seems that poor judgement is a theme in john mccain s life _meta_end_dot_

 this story is bad for him from so many angles i m not sure if mccain survives this one _meta_end_dot_

 speculation about an affair is one thing but an intimate relationship with a telecommunications lobbyist _meta_end_question_

 not smart _meta_end_dot_

 not smart at all _meta_end_dot_

 and somewhere mike huckabee is smiling _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
