  as wga members consider a proposed deal with the amptp and wga leadership decides how and how quickly to end the strike there are a lot of questions _meta_end_dot_

 i for sure don t know the answers to all of them and some of them probably don t have answers at this point _meta_end_dot_

 but here s a try and some resources _meta_end_dot_

 is the strike over _meta_end_question_

 not yet but almost certainly within a couple of days _meta_end_dot_

 one possibility is that the wga board could vote to end the strike prior to a ratification vote by the union s membership _meta_end_dot_

 in that case writers could be back to work on monday _meta_end_dot_

 another possibility advocated by most of the founders of united hollywood and reported by deadline hollywood daily to be the plan would be to hold a vote of the membership with _meta_number_ref_ hours notice _meta_end_dot_

 the membership will vote on the deal eventually but this way the strike wouldn t end until it was clear that that was the majority choice _meta_end_dot_

 that would have writers back at work on wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 so when will my favorite tv shows be back on _meta_end_question_

 if your favorite shows are late night talk shows they should be back on as soon as the strike ends _meta_end_dot_

 but so depending on the show and the network it could be a while _meta_end_dot_

 did the writers win _meta_end_question_

 unfortunately it s not that simple _meta_end_dot_

 they certainly didn t get everything they deserved but they got a lot more than they would have had they not gone on strike or ended the strike a couple months ago _meta_end_dot_

 that s a victory just not the hot damn _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is perfect kind _meta_end_dot_

 reports are that meetings on the east and west coasts were positive though not euphoric questions were raised but the overall mood points to acceptance of the deal _meta_end_dot_

 david latt at united hollywood so what did being out on strike for three months get the wga _meta_end_question_

 well it gets fairly technical as this summary pdf shows and i am not an expert in entertainment finance issues _meta_end_dot_

 but a first glance reading of the deal by robert elisberg amplifies my own less informed first reading there are several advances made in the language of the deal the way things are defined and precedents are set _meta_end_dot_

 that s important both for enforcement of this contract and for bargaining for future ones _meta_end_dot_

 but enforcement will be key especially in an industry as renowned for fuzzy bookkeeping as film and television _meta_end_dot_

 tom smuts another wga member makes similar points specifically regarding the initial streaming window or period of time in which a show can be viewed online without triggering payments to writers _meta_end_dot_

 but because new media is new and we don t yet know all the ways content will be acquired through new media a lot of this is guesswork _meta_end_dot_

 will people only stream things when they re relatively new and the writers therefore aren t being paid or will people keep watching weeks and months after an initial airing _meta_end_question_

 radically different possibilities for how this will play out are posed in a point counterpoint at united hollywood _meta_end_dot_
