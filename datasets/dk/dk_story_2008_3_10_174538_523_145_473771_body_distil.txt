  yes clinton surrogate geraldine ferraro said that _meta_end_dot_

 geraldine ferraro nominated as vice president almost entirely because she was a woman ridiculing barack obama s rise as supposedly due to his race is a case of the pot calling the kettle black _meta_end_dot_

 one can laugh at the ridiculousness of the statement or ridicule the idea that african americans somehow have it easier in america than white men or women _meta_end_dot_

 but to do so misses how ferraro s statement will be heard by too many americans _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is there are a lot of white people in american who believe they re at a disadvantage that blacks get things handed to them _meta_end_dot_

 the idea may be foreign to some people but i ve heard it my entire life _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard it at family gatherings in my neighborhood when i was a kid from family friends and all kinds of other folks _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a fringe belief _meta_end_dot_

 it s at the heart of the belief system of the so called reagan democrats swing voters and even some democrats who were cradle democrats but defected to reagan and have been up for grabs in most elections since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 some of these reagan democrats will hear ferraro s comment and they ll think about the job they didn t get because they believe it went to an affirmative action hire _meta_end_dot_

 they ll think about the guy promoted over them because they believe he s black _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll think here we go again believing african americans are affording unfair advantages certainly isn t a belief that prevents people from voting democratic _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ for instance michigan democrats picked up offices and a weak democratic governor won reelection but at the same time _meta_percent_ref_ of democrats voted to ban race from being a factor in state government hiring or university admissions _meta_end_dot_

 one can give ferraro the benefit of the doubt and assume that her comment was just a slip of the tongue one can assume that the wife of bill clinton the man from hope known for his passionate desire to bring about racial reconciliation in america would never hope to benefit from racist envy and distrust _meta_end_dot_

 and one can assume that the clinton campaign wouldn t deliberately appeal to racial prejudice to win the nomination because to conclude otherwise might make you want to vomit _meta_end_dot_
