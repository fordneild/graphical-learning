  a few weeks ago i took a look back at a bit of parliamentary maneuvering that the house republicans have been using to great effect in derailing democratic legislation and even pushing republican legislation through the house even though the _meta_number_ref_ elections gave dems nominal control of the chamber _meta_end_dot_

 specifically i looked at the way republicans were able to use the motion to recommit or even just the threat of it to force through the odious fisa bill passed last august _meta_end_dot_

 the motion to recommit has been used by the republicans used to drive wedges into the democratic caucus time and time again _meta_end_dot_

 that s the modern function of the motion really _meta_end_dot_

 originally the mtr was designed to offer the minority a modicum of fairness in debate by giving it an opportunity to propose either a refinement or even a complete alternative to whatever bill was under consideration and get an up or down vote on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 today it s mostly used to engineer uncomfortable votes that the majority will have to swallow with a smile in order to get legislation passed _meta_end_dot_

 most typically it s used in ways that are substantively meaningless though imbued with symbolic meaning that s destructive to democratic unity such as by offering a motion to amend some pending bill such that the funds in it are prohibited from use for providing services to illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 in almost every case either the the bill itself or existing law already prohibits such spending but republicans insist on a vote on it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and the democratic leadership chiefly it seems at the instruction of steny hoyer and rahm emanuel routinely refrains from instructing democrats in swing districts to avoid such entanglements with the gop agenda and in fact encourages them to defuse potential election issues by going along with such motions since they make no substantive change in the state of the law _meta_end_dot_

 but this freedom to vote your district has a flip side a lack of routine caucus discipline that rejects republican procedural maneuvering in all cases and dismisses out of hand these last minute manipulations _meta_end_dot_

 because democratic members are free to go along with republicans on most motions to recommit it s hard to corral them back when you need them to resist particularly pernicious ones as was the case with the fisa bill in august _meta_end_dot_

 it should come as no surprise then that the same dynamic caused some intra caucus tension late this week through republican use of a close cousin of the motion to recommit the motion to instruct conferees _meta_end_dot_

 find out just what happened after the break _meta_end_dot_
