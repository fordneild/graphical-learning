  my daughter in second grade has been let s face it an unholy terror of a child of late _meta_end_dot_

 i blame this entirely on her fellow classmates at her public school as she was an impeccably well adjusted unfailingly polite and conscientious child before she met them that s my story anyway and i ll stick to it _meta_end_dot_

 before starting school she was an emotionally competent if energetic child able to comport herself with all the grace a preschooler is capable of mustering _meta_end_dot_

 after starting school she almost immediately absorbed all the most primal lessons of grade school social interaction and has become a small pink clothed monster _meta_end_dot_

 some of this i recognize from my own childhood of course _meta_end_dot_

 the petty tribalism the true vapidity of what counts as friend or enemy and the seemingly tidal nature with which the two designations come and go primarily revolving around who brings what fabulous new toy marble trading card sugar bomb handheld game whatever etc and so on _meta_end_dot_

 some comrades show the first twinges of what may someday become true friendship others reveal themselves to be the future bane of all those they come in contact with _meta_end_dot_

 other lessons though are different _meta_end_dot_

 as a grade school boy i cannot deny that social interactions were much more twinged with actual violence in our circles social skills were not just lacking but actively avoided _meta_end_dot_

 my daughter has given me a new window into the interactions of sub ten year old girls which combine the implicit physical violence common among boys with an underlying social viciousness that we boys would have been boggled by _meta_end_dot_

 deny it all you want but young boys and young girls are different and if i had my pick i know i would far rather have been made to eat playground dirt than be subjected with the withering coldly plotting glare of a grade school girl contemplating my relative value in her social circle and what she was about to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 life never progresses much beyond high school goes one common observation _meta_end_dot_

 i think though that this is perhaps being more charitable towards many adults than is warranted _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps some people never manage to evolve past basic high school social interactions but for others even that seems a lofty pinnacle indeed _meta_end_dot_

 everything i needed to know about the implicit tenets and instincts of conservatism for example i learned and rejected before i had turned ten _meta_end_dot_

 my daughter seems on the same path _meta_end_dot_
