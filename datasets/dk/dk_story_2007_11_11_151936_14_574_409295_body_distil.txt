  from the diaries barbinmd right things _meta_end_dot_

 these memorials exist for us to see and reflect to draw our own conclusions about how we feel or felt about a particular war and make judgments as to the war s relative rightness or wrongness _meta_end_dot_

 i deeply appreciate these memorials despite the fact that in some ways they glorify battle something which should be avoided at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 what i mean is if you were an alien who was dropped in the middle of arlington at the iwo jima memorial or you were dropped into the center of the world war ii memorial you d see odes and testaments to bravery and patriotism that wouldn t necessarily tell the real story of the war itself _meta_end_dot_

 it would utterly lack context _meta_end_dot_

 yet living in this country and being reasonably well educated allows me to appreciate the memorials within their respective proper contexts _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t write this diary however to talk about the beauty of our national war memorials or to specifically discuss the bravery of the individuals honored or the folly or wisdom of the particular war itself _meta_end_dot_

 rather this diary operates in reverse order of my thought process as i rose this morning and reflected on veteran s day _meta_end_dot_

 it made me think of a report i saw on cnn last thursday one which featured this staggering opening there have been some great diaries on ptsd here at daily kos follow the link to all _meta_number_ref_ of them and i believe that the readership here understands what a huge problem it already is and its potential for growth _meta_end_dot_

 in a system that already clearly can t accommodate the unique needs of veterans i m sick to think about how many iraq war vets will degenerate from lack of proper mental and physical care and join the ranks of the veteran homeless in the coming years _meta_end_dot_

 i sadly expect that the faces will continue to get younger blending in with the older telling a story of literally generations of veterans tossed aside by a system that doesn t serve their needs or interests _meta_end_dot_

 as i watched the ceremony laying the wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier this morning and saw that it was cheney who did the honors and heard the reporter stating that bush was in crawford engaged in critical meetings i became incensed _meta_end_dot_

 that passed though because i don t know how i could expect better of a person who didn t serve and who currently treats living veterans like garbage _meta_end_dot_

 the only bright spot with this veteran s day and the days leading up to it was the attention that the homeless veteran story received within the more mainstream press _meta_end_dot_

 what better time to show the criminal treatment veterans are receiving than nearly simultaneous with cheney s wreath laying and bush s speech at the waco vfd _meta_end_question_

 does he think that whatever words he spoke this day have truly spoken louder than his actions _meta_end_question_

 sadly there are living memorials across this country _meta_end_dot_

 right now i can tell you for certain that there s an encampment under an overpass on _meta_number_ref_ north i see them there all the time camped out _meta_end_dot_

 they are more valuable than any stone or engraving that men s minds can conceive _meta_end_dot_
