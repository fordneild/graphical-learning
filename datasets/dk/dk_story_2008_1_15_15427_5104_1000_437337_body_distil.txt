  it only took a few tweaks and voila _meta_end_exclamation_

 richard cohen managed to repackage the obama is actually a closet black racist who will turn the white house into a black muslim enclave smears that are circulating the worst of the right wing hate sites into a column for today s washington post that s right _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama goes to a church that has a pastor who has a daughter who publishes a magazine that gave an award to louis farrakhan _meta_end_dot_

 you can understand cohen s outrage _meta_end_dot_

 and apparently that outrage paralyzed him to the point where it took nearly a year after the story was first reported for cohen to call obama out on this _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it lucky for all of america that he was able to find the words to express his feelings in time for the heart of the primary season _meta_end_question_

 and kudos to cohen for being so even handed _meta_end_dot_

 because he does three paragraphs in say that well nothing in his record suggests such a thing but we can t be too careful eh richard _meta_end_question_

 but really nice job on stating that right off there is no doubt that louis farrahkan has a history of making hateful anti semitic remarks _meta_end_dot_

 but barack obama is not an associate of mr _meta_end_dot_

 farrakhan nor has he ever advocated his views so for richard cohen to attempt to connect the two men in the voter s minds is nothing short of equating obama with every vicious racial stereotype out there that is used to generate fear and hatred _meta_end_dot_

 cohen ends with no cohen doesn t think that for a minute but he still chose to write this because obama is a fog of a man you know he s not quite one of us he might be a muslim and i heard that he went to a madrassa _meta_end_dot_

 maybe with louis farrakhan _meta_end_dot_

 we can t be too careful _meta_end_dot_
