  ugh _meta_end_dot_

 i am willing to state that the texas system of primary and caucus is freakin moronic _meta_end_dot_

 throw it on the list of things in desperate need of reform once these elections are done along with all caucuses the super delegates the delegate apportioning formula the calendar the iowa nh monopoly and open primaries _meta_end_dot_

 though i concede that of all of these the open primaries thing would probably meet the most resistance yes many of these rules are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 but they re the rules _meta_end_dot_

 you don t change them mid contest _meta_end_dot_

 yet it always seems as though it s the clinton campaign seeking to change the rules when they don t suit hillary s efforts _meta_end_dot_
