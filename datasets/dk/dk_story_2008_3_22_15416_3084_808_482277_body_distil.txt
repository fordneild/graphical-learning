  the polls the finances and the conventional wisdom are all pointing in the same direction it s almost impossible for hillary clinton to win the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 first the polls _meta_end_dot_

 the wright controversy hurt barack obama and it may in the long run be a problem _meta_end_dot_

 but he appears to have recovered from the dip in the polls that coincided with the height of negative attention over obama s former pastor _meta_end_dot_

 he s recovered the lead over clinton in the gallup daily tracking poll that he lost during the wright affair the day of his philadelphia speech clinton had opened up a _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ lead _meta_end_dot_

 three days later obama has regained the lead _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the cbs nyt poll pdf asked questions about obama s tuesday speech on race _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of voters following the story thought obama did a good job of explaining wright _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of democrats polled agree with obama s views on race relations in the us against only _meta_percent_ref_ who disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 among independents it was _meta_percent_ref_ agreeing and only _meta_percent_ref_ disagreeing _meta_end_dot_

 when asked if his speech would make voters more likely to vote for obama less likely or wouldn t make a difference the net movement was zero _meta_end_dot_

 obama would need to be severely damaged by the wright controversy for it to benefit hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the polls suggest that the damage at least within the democratic primary electorate may be minimal _meta_end_dot_

 obama s strong standing in the polls and his likely insurmountable delegate lead is starting to shape conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 what some of us have known for a month is finally dawning on the traditional media and the dc and nyc gatekeepers of traditional media narratives _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday it was the politico exposing the dirty little secret that traditional media hasn t been reporting that it s damn near impossible for hillary clinton to win the nomination because reporters love the drama and the media companies love the profits generated by the viewers and readers lured by their breathless misreporting _meta_end_dot_

 we know there s reluctance to tell hillary clinton bad news so today we have another gatekeeper and creator of media narratives time senior political analyst mark halperin providing a list of painful things hillary clinton knows or should know _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few of his bullet points the nyt has two stories today about clinton s fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 in the first longer and more prominent story much is made of her improved online fundraising in february _meta_end_dot_

 clinton did see a dramatic up tick in money coming in over the internet last month _meta_end_dot_

 but the harsh realities that the clinton campaign has largely kept from the media until very recently are laid bare in the second article clinton has had a built in advantage in just about every state except illinois in that polls regularly show she s started with an often substantial lead _meta_end_dot_

 it s less expensive to protect a lead than to overcome one _meta_end_dot_

 all things being equal she doesn t need to spend as much as obama _meta_end_dot_

 although all things aren t equal for instance her fec report shows that she owes mark penn about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million however she can t continue to get outspent and win races by the margins that would be required for her to even narrow the delegate gap between her and obama _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday when he endorsed barack obama bill richardson danced close to calling on clinton to step aside and acknowledge that barack obama will be our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 he pulled back from that position later in the day but only a tiny bit richardson may not call directly for clinton to step aside _meta_end_dot_

 but she s headed in that direction _meta_end_dot_

 the facts of delegate math are finally dawning on the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 donors aren t filling her coffers with money at a rate that she can be competitive with obama _meta_end_dot_

 as the media narrative catches up with the delegate math the donors will be even less likely to give to her further exacerbating her financial problems _meta_end_dot_

 with the delegate numbers nearly insurmountable with the media declaring her candidacy nearing its end with money running tight and with more and more prominent democratic leaders likely to join richardson in calling for democrats to unify and turn attention to defeating john mccain the question becomes more urgent when will hillary clinton admit that barack obama will be our presidential nominee _meta_end_question_
