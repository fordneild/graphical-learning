  fresh off bill foster s inspiring victory in the il _meta_number_ref_ special election in early march it looks as though democrats are poised to take a serious run at another republican seat in an even redder district in the special election in louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 subscription only roll call reports that the gop s own internal polls show their frontrunner former state rep _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate nominee woody jenkins trailing democrat don cazayoux hat tip to james at swing state project assuming that cazayoux and jenkins are the nominees they face runoff elections on saturday against state rep _meta_end_dot_

 michael jackson and businesswoman laurinda calongne respectively it sure looks like the republicans are actually going to have to work to keep this very red r _meta_number_ref_ district _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely that the cash strapped nrcc last seen dumping over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million into a losing race in il _meta_number_ref_ will have to throw in quite a bit of money if they want to keep the seat _meta_end_dot_

 cazayoux s fundraising as of mach _meta_number_ref_ filings had dwarfed jenkins with cazayoux pulling in over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to jenkins _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact cazayoux strength against jenkins has led to speculation that the nrcc may back away from this race though i really cannot see them giving up on such a republican district _meta_end_dot_

 so why is jenkins performing so poorly _meta_end_question_

 after all he nearly won his _meta_number_ref_ senate race and he seem like the republicans dream candidate _meta_end_dot_

 his berserk conservative credentials are exceptional he sports endorsements by such luminaries as james dobson tony perkins tim left behind lahaye and the club for growth _meta_end_dot_

 however it seems jenkins has a whole boatload of baggage beyond the fact that extremists love him _meta_end_dot_

 stuart rothenberg reports david duke eh _meta_end_question_

 well i suppose i do see why the nrcc would want to stay away from this race particularly given their financial woes _meta_end_dot_

 of course while they can t afford to dump vats of money into protecting this seat as they did in il _meta_number_ref_ they can t really afford not to spend here either _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have held this district since _meta_number_ref_ when they were able to take it in an overwhelmingly democratic year during a time when louisiana was still strongly democratic _meta_end_dot_

 losing a district such as this one would be a serious black eye for house republicans on top of the one they just received in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there s no good way out for the nrcc and house republicans in this race _meta_end_dot_

 either they spend even more of their precious resources to back a controversial candidate with ugly baggage or they risk losing another high profile special election in a solidly republican district _meta_end_dot_

 or both can happen _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t necessarily bet on us winning this race but the mere fact that it s so competitive is already a win for us _meta_end_dot_

 and it should be very exciting to watch over the next month _meta_end_dot_
