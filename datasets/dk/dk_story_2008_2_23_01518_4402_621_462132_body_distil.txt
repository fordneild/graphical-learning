  there is good news from iraq today day _meta_number_ref_ since mission was accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 while not all of sadr s military and political allies have bought into the cease fire hence that statement from the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military the extension of the cease fire will hopefully continue to tamp down violence because what the country has experienced under the cease fire has been bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 without it it could have been much worse _meta_end_dot_

 this will hopefully provide at least a measure of protection for our forces until we have a new congress and president to bring them home _meta_end_dot_
