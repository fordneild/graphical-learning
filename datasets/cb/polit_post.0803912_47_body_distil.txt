  mississippi sen _meta_end_dot_

 thad cochran r _meta_number_ref_ days ago on the idea of john mccain getting elected mississippi sen _meta_end_dot_

 thad cochran r last night on his presidential endorsement in the end they come around _meta_end_dot_

 they always do _meta_end_dot_

 i argued on monday that mccain despite being the only sitting senator seeking the republican nomination the last four months and despite having been in congress for a quarter century had not exactly won over the people who know him best the other republican senators who work with him day in and day out _meta_end_dot_

 before super tuesday only _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ senators in the republican caucus had backed their colleague s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo had a front page item detailing that mccain s relationship with his co workers has always been strained but that was monday when it seemed as if these guys still had a choice _meta_end_dot_

 f_meta_beep_ref_k you _meta_end_exclamation_

 i know more about this than anyone else in the room mccain shouted _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo added that mccain also used a curse word associated with chickens yesterday cornyn left with no other choice jumped on the bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 or consider the case of senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ken who has never gotten along with mccain but who yesterday threw his support to the likely nominee _meta_end_dot_

 or how about sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r iowa who worked closely with mccain in _meta_number_ref_ on a senate special committee on pow mia affairs _meta_end_dot_

 when grassley disagreed with mccain about something the arizonan told him you know senator i thought your problem was that you don t listen _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not it at all _meta_end_dot_

 your problem is that you re a f_meta_beep_ref_king jerk and yet there was grassley defending mccain this week _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that limbaugh santorum and other republican establishment figures will continue to resist and i suspect most of them are probably sincere _meta_end_dot_

 but come the fall the gop will be united behind mccain and any democratic hopes about a splintered republican party are probably just wishful thinking _meta_end_dot_
