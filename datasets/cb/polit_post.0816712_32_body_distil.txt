  this michelle obama quote uttered back in february is probably the republicans single favorite development of the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the right pounced insisting that this was proof that the obamas are insufficiently patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign quickly explained that she misspoke what she meant is that she s really proud at this moment because for the first time in a long time thousands of americans who ve never participated in politics before are coming out in record numbers to build a grass roots movement for change but to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 less than _meta_number_ref_ hours after obama made the comment cindy mccain pointedly told reporters that she s very proud of my country as if michelle obama isn t _meta_end_dot_

 ms _meta_end_dot_

 mccain repeated the line at multiple campaign events just to make sure the point was driven home the first time in my adult lifetime has been the focus of conservative tv ads and video clips ever since _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind john mccain hosted an online q _meta_number_ref_ a yesterday and heard from a man who was educated at princeton and harvard and who made more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 how can i be proud of my country he asked _meta_end_dot_

 the question was obviously intended to be a pointed joke mocking michelle obama _meta_end_dot_

 not only did mccain not pick up on the joke he offered a surprisingly revealing answer _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan martin reported the irony is mccain s answer was perfectly reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 but by giving an honest response to a sarcastic question mccain inadvertently bolstered the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s tough to be proud of the united states _meta_end_question_

 we re too arrogant and overly exclusive _meta_end_question_

 these aren t radical treasonous ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama had said the same thing you better believe we d not only hear about it but the comments would quickly become the basis for an aggressive push back campaign that would last from now until november _meta_end_dot_

 what do you mean it s tough to be proud of america _meta_end_question_

 it s easy to be proud of the greatest country on earth _meta_end_dot_

 why would someone who wants to lead the nation not believe that something to keep in mind the next time republicans decide to go after michelle obama _meta_end_dot_
