  john mccain has been pursuing a risky campaign strategy of late going relentlessly negative and attacking barack obama s character _meta_end_dot_

 this has offered a short term benefit mccain has made real gains in the polls but has created a long term threat by seriously undermining his brand mccain had developed a reputation for straight talk and substance and he decided to flush it down the toilet _meta_end_dot_

 today in an effort to rehabilitate his former persona mccain s campaign unveiled a new ad that doesn t go after obama at all _meta_end_dot_

 via greg sargent the voice over in this _meta_number_ref_ second spot tells the viewer washington s broken john mccain knows it _meta_end_dot_

 we re worse off than we were four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties _meta_end_dot_

 he ll reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again the ad continues he s the original maverick _meta_end_dot_

 one is ready to lead mccain the ad ends of course with the obligatory i m john mccain and i approved this message it s a nice effort i suppose but it s way too late for the mccain campaign to restore an image that mccain has already thrown away _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the specifics of the claims only help reinforce the fact that mccain is a shadow of his former self _meta_end_dot_

 washington s broken john mccain knows it there s simply no way to run as a washington outsider after three decades of being a washington insider _meta_end_dot_

 we re worse off than we were four years ago really _meta_end_dot_

 is that so _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing mccain was campaigning for and hugging the guy who won four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 for another mccain s been telling voters for a while that americans are better off than we were before bush took office _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has taken on big tobacco actually he used to take on big tobacco and then he shamelessly reversed course on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has taken on drug companies actually he used to take on the drug companies and took an active role in support drug re importation _meta_end_dot_

 this mccain however hasn t mentioned the issue in years _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has fought corruption in both parties actually mccain was part of the corruption in one of the parties _meta_end_dot_

 but my single favorite line in the entire ad is the claim that mccain will battle big oil um senator _meta_end_question_

 your energy policy was written by big oil and your campaign is being financed by big oil _meta_end_dot_

 unless you re prepared to change the meaning of the word battle this is crazy _meta_end_dot_

 obama campaign spokesperson bill burton said in a statement yep _meta_end_dot_
