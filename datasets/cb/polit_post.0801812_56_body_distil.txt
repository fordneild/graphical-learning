  one has to assume that it s tough being a campaign reporter for a major news outlet especially for a wire service like the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 the hours are ridiculous the travel is constant the deadlines are tight and not incidentally they have to listen to presidential candidates repeat quite a bit of nonsense on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 once in a great while not surprisingly a reporter just can t take it anymore _meta_end_dot_

 as keith olbermann explained it s rare for a presidential candidate to be interrupted and criticized to his face rarer still to have it come from a member of the mainstream media and rarest of all to see that candidate resume the battle while cameras roll and yet that s exactly what happened _meta_end_dot_

 lest there be any confusion glen johnson is not just some schmoe he s a highly respected ap reporter and the closest thing to the senior man on the romney beat and as of yesterday he s heard romney dissemble one too many times _meta_end_dot_

 online and is certainly worth watching if only because this kind of exchange simply never happens _meta_end_dot_

 romney made a bogus claim about the role of lobbyists in his campaign johnson called him on it immediately and romney proceeded to debate johnson on the meaning of the phrase my campaign drama aside johnson let the facts speak for themselves in print _meta_end_dot_

 now in context romney was going after john mccain s lobbyists ties and this is to be sure fertile ground _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s criticism of special interest lobbyists is shamelessly hypocritical and misleading _meta_end_dot_

 but romney took his pitch too far and got called on it _meta_end_dot_

 afterwards a romney aide chastised johnson for being unprofessional i m not so sure if more reporters confronted candidates when they lie candidates might tell the truth more often _meta_end_dot_
