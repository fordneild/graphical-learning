  it s just not reasonable to think democratic presidential candidates in the heat of a very competitive campaign are going to stay positive _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 ideally it might sound nice to think everyone will just get along and dems will save all of their criticisms for the republicans but that alas is just not how campaigns work _meta_end_dot_

 i m afraid it s naive to think otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 arguably these intra party fights are a good thing in that they help prepare the eventual nominee for the general election with that in mind i don t much care if hillary clinton john edwards and barack obama go at it aggressively _meta_end_dot_

 i do mind when the attacks are inane misleading and ultimately pointless _meta_end_dot_

 i think the flap over ronald reagan qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 if you re just joining us obama gave an interview this week in nevada in which he said reagan and jfk during their respective eras put the nation on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it obama s democratic critics seized on this as proof of having some kind of affinity for reagan s conservative ideology but i think the fairest most intellectually honest interpretation is that obama was describing transformational figures who seized opportunities to shift the political direction of the country _meta_end_dot_

 specifically regarding reagan obama seemed to be talking about reagan s political skills victories his ability to bring voters into the gop fold and his success at tapping into the public s attitudes of the time _meta_end_dot_

 the country was ready for a fundamental change in _meta_number_ref_ and reagan became a vehicle to move the country to the right _meta_end_dot_

 the country may be ready for a similar kind of change in _meta_number_ref_ and obama wants to be a similar vehicle to move the country to the left _meta_end_dot_

 reagan expanded the republican party obama wants to expand the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 reagan wrapped conservative ideas in warm reassuring rhetoric obama wants to do the same with progressive ideas _meta_end_dot_

 now rank and file dems can certainly disagree about whether obama is the right the vehicle to bring about this change and whether he has the capacity to be a transformational figure _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton edwards and kucinich supporters want to make the case that their candidate is better qualified to take advantage of this historic opportunity more power to em _meta_end_dot_

 may the best candidate win _meta_end_dot_

 but the debate over the last couple of days has devolved into sheer nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday was particularly painful _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj noted the efforts to make obama out to be some kind of reaganite _meta_end_dot_

 of course reagan was destructive force with a conservative agenda _meta_end_dot_

 obama never said he wanted to follow in reagan s footsteps he suggested he wanted to bring about fundamental change that the country is ready for just as reagan did _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t mean the same specific kind of change _meta_end_dot_

 to pretend otherwise is just dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 maybe twisting the meaning of innocuous words will help clinton and edwards score a few cheap points with people who aren t paying close attention to the facts but that doesn t make it right _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it makes it even worse because it compounds cynicism with deceit _meta_end_dot_

 simply mentioning reagan in a positive way does not make a person sympathetic to reagan s policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 last night for example the obama campaign found a couple of instances in which hillary clinton included reagan among the presidents she most admired and praised his communications skills _meta_end_dot_

 should obama now schedule a conference call in which one of his congressional supporters tells reporters ronald reagan was a dedicated right winger it s baffling to me that hillary clinton would speak so favorably of him _meta_end_question_

 of course not that would be ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 and yet that s what the clinton campaign did yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 there are plenty of avenues of attack for clinton and edwards to go after obama _meta_end_dot_

 can t they stick to ones that make sense _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_question_
