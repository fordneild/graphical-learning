  today s installment of campaign related news items that wouldn t generate a post of their own but may be of interest to political observers a boston globe poll of new hampshire voters released yesterday included some eyebrow raising numbers in both primaries _meta_end_dot_

 among republicans while mitt romney has had a comfortable lead in the state his margin is shrinking fast the former massachusetts governor now leading with _meta_percent_ref_ followed closely by john mccain with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani who was a threat to win new hampshire a couple of months ago has slipped to a distant third with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the same globe poll also pointed to a very competitive democratic race _meta_end_dot_

 in last month s poll hillary clinton led by _meta_number_ref_ points now that lead is gone barack obama has inched out in front with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by clinton at _meta_percent_ref_ with john edwards third with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of obama the senator was campaigning in iowa over the weekend when he was confronted with a voter who wanted him to explain his muslim background obama said my father was from kenya and a lot of people in his village were muslim _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t practice islam _meta_end_dot_

 truth is he wasn t very religious _meta_end_dot_

 he met my mother _meta_end_dot_

 my mother was a christian from kansas _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always been a christian _meta_end_dot_

 the only connection i ve had to islam is that my grandfather on my father s side came from that country _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve never practiced islam the voter seemed satisfied _meta_end_dot_

 newspapers in iowa and new hampshire routinely write endorsement editorials this time of year but the concord monitor editorial board tried something different over the weekend imploring readers not to vote for romney who the paper said most surely must be stopped with a touch of condescension giuliani told reporters yesterday that he likes mccain and would consider bringing him on as a presidential advisor if elected _meta_end_dot_

 john would be a really good adviser giuliani said adding i have great respect for him _meta_end_dot_

 i know he has great respect for me wsj john edwards will get a welcome endorsement this evening from the iowa farmers union the state s biggest advocacy group for family farmers and rural communities _meta_end_dot_

 the endorsement comes as the top democratic presidential candidates have been trying to woo the rural vote in hopes that iowa s rural communities will make the difference in what is expected to be a historically close caucus on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while the rural vote has typically favored republicans economic uncertainty and frustration with the war in iraq has motivated many rural voters to consider democrats bob novak reported yesterday that mccain is openly boosting huckabee s campaign in iowa with the hopes that a romney defeat will make it easier for mccain in new hampshire t he mccain camp acknowledges that a romney victory in iowa may trigger a win in new hampshire and a chance to sweep subsequent primaries _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain insiders feel huckabee will not be a serious candidate even if he defeats romney in iowa ron paul was on meet the press yesterday and would not rule out an independent presidential campaign saying only i have no intention of doing that when pressed by russert to state unequivocally that he would not paul joked i deserve one wiggle now and then tim the nra isn t likely to play a significant role in the early democratic contests but for what it s worth the gun group is backing richardson the national rifle association of america political victory fund has reported spending money on a planned mailing for bill richardson _meta_end_dot_

 the move appears at least for now to be a token gesture just under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ all told spent on lists printing and labor
