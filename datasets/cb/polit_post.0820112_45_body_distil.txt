  for the last several years anytime high profile u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials arrive in iraq or afghanistan it s described as a surprise visit _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how many times these officials go to the countries or how long their stay it s always a surprise there s no real mystery here if the arrival of vips were publicized their lives might be in danger _meta_end_dot_

 journalists are almost always responsible with this information and see no reason to create a potentially dangerous situation _meta_end_dot_

 when there are exceptions it tends to spark outrage john mccain for example was furious when the press reported on his son serving in iraq because mccain feared the coverage would make him a target the point is obvious to protect americans lives details on trips to iraq and or afghanistan are kept under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows this and everyone respects this _meta_end_dot_

 it makes john mccain s careless remarks yesterday all the more striking _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry said he was surprised by mccain s apparent breach of protocol i ve been around enough of these trips to know that i m leery of saying anything for security reasons _meta_end_dot_

 end of story and therein lies the point john mccain has been around enough of these trips to know the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for whatever reason he ignored security concerns because he wanted to score a cheap political point _meta_end_dot_

 actually i really wish he had but that s not what happened _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said either today or tomorrow those aren t broader terms they re fairly specific terms _meta_end_dot_

 a handful of reporters alluded to a general timeline nbc s andrea mitchell told viewers yesterday that obama would be arriving in iraq shortly but only mccain referenced specific days _meta_end_dot_

 mark kleiman considered some competing explanations _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to imagine the first and third options being true which suggests mccain was either confused forgetful or dangerously careless or possible some combination therein _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen some suggestions that mccain might have been trying to force obama to postpone his stop in iraq by making it excessively risky and thereby saying a ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 obama won t go to iraq after all this too strikes me as unlikely i m hesitant to get too outraged by this _meta_end_dot_

 obama s schedule wasn t classified and given what we know about the rest of his european schedule one might have been able to infer that the stops in the middle east were going to happen this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter as much as i ve lost respect for mccain i m hardly at the point at which i believe he s willing to literally put obama s life in danger _meta_end_dot_

 that said john mccain s increasing recklessness raises legitimate questions _meta_end_dot_

 even if he wasn t sure about obama s schedule and was merely speculating about the weekend mccain knows how this system works _meta_end_dot_

 he knows why any and all details are kept secret _meta_end_dot_

 he knows why breaking protocol is literally dangerous to those traveling into war zones _meta_end_dot_

 for most of us it s just common sense _meta_end_dot_

 for someone who s been in the senate as long as mccain has and has traveled as extensively as mccain has it s standard operating procedure _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he did it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 at an absolute minimum it should undermine public confidence in john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add one thing _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall asked any thoughts on the reaction if barack obama had publicly broken the embargo on details and timing of sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s imminent visit to a war zone i shudder to think of the apoplexy _meta_end_dot_

 we would hear about it literally every day for the rest of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 republicans everywhere would call obama a traitor and the media would create huge graphics that read obama does he want mccain killed democratic members of congress would distance themselves from obama and the senator would be forced to issue a public apology _meta_end_dot_

 every media narrative about inexperience lack of national security bona fides etc _meta_end_dot_

 would be reinforced _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a development that literally changed the election _meta_end_dot_

 but given that it was mccain who divulged details the story will probably go nowhere _meta_end_dot_
