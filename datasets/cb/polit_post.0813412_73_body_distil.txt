  the new washington post abc news poll is chock full of interesting tidbits to mull over _meta_end_dot_

 most notably in light of the past week s events in the democratic presidential race it appears that barack obama is largely where he wants to be _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly about a month ago when jeremiah wright was dominating the news hillary clinton performed better than obama in several general election match ups against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that obama now has a slight advantage on this point the post abc poll shows obama leading mccain by seven _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ while clinton leads mccain by three _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this edge is even more striking among independents who prefer obama to mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ but prefer mccain to clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of the issues obama enjoys double digit advantages over mccain on healthcare gas prices and the economy while mccain has a _meta_number_ref_ point lead in combating terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 on personal attributes obama excels in bringing needed change temperament empathy and clarity of vision _meta_end_dot_

 mccain fares better on experience and knowledge of world affairs _meta_end_dot_

 they re about tied on leadership and personal and ethical standards as for the septuagenarian issue which i ve been harping on for weeks the polling data points to this remaining a key hurdle for mccain only three in _meta_number_ref_ said they were entirely comfortable with the prospect of a _meta_number_ref_ year old new president about half as many as those who said they would be similarly comfortable with an african american or female president i don t doubt that at least some of this is skewed by those who don t want to admit to racism or misogyny but i emphasize this again because it continues to look like an issue that few are talking about but which may make a difference _meta_end_dot_

 as for the general landscape to say republicans are at a disadvantage this year is quite an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 really unhappy with the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 as for the biggest surprise in the poll i had assumed dems were anxious to see the nomination fight end _meta_end_dot_

 apparently despite obama s double digit lead among dems the party s rank and file are not exactly anxious to see clinton drop out _meta_end_dot_

 a new usa today gallup poll found a similar response with only _meta_percent_ref_ of dems saying clinton should withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 that s up _meta_number_ref_ points since last week but it s still only a third _meta_percent_ref_ of dems are happy to have both obama and clinton keep campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 and as long as we re going through national polls the latest gallup daily tracking poll shows obama expanding his lead over clinton to seven points _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ the largest the margin has been in a few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly obama also has taken a four point lead over mccain the largest lead obama has enjoyed since gallup began asking the question in march _meta_end_dot_
