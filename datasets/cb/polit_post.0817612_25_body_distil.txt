  in _meta_number_ref_ in his keynote address to the democratic national convention barack obama briefly touched on the scourge of racial stereotypes the people i meet in small towns and big cities in diners and office parks they don t expect government to solve all their problems _meta_end_dot_

 they know that parents have to parent that children can t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white nevertheless not only do the stereotypes persist but obama s detractors are applying the same standard to him personally _meta_end_dot_

 right wing loudmouth glenn beck recently said obama might as well be white rush limbaugh said obama has disowned his white half _meta_end_dot_

 h e s decided he s got to go all in on the black side and yesterday washington post political reporter jonathan weisman who s not a columnist or pundit participated in an online discussion with readers during which he went to the same place _meta_end_dot_

 the analysis is itself flawed _meta_end_dot_

 the ad talks about obama s background and it s likely he didn t feature a picture of his father because he wasn t a part of obama s childhood _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly the notion that other than his skin color obama is much more white than black is utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 what is a comment like this even based on _meta_end_question_

 black people are only really black if white washington post reporters perceive them as immersed in black american culture _meta_end_question_

 black people are whiter if they re raised by white relatives _meta_end_question_

 who comes up with these rules _meta_end_question_

 and what does beyond skin color even mean _meta_end_question_

 it s like saying i m much more short than tall beyond my _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ height _meta_end_dot_

 but weisman seems to really let his guard down during these chats and reveals a little too much _meta_end_dot_

 about a year ago for example in the midst of a congressional investigation into voter suppression allegations against karl rove protege u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney tim griffin a reader asked weisman about monica goodling s testimony on caging _meta_end_dot_

 weisman responded so what is this caging thing _meta_end_question_

 last month weisman participated in a chat and when five of the first _meta_number_ref_ questions focused on john mccain weisman complained about readers interests _meta_end_dot_

 asked about senior mccain adviser charlie black s lobbying for ahmed chalabi weisman responded oy what s with all the mccain questions _meta_end_question_

 shortly thereafter asked about a democratic lawmaker weisman was relieved ah thank goodness someone in chatting land is a republican around the same time weisman defended mccain s maverick reputation telling readers mccain has cultivated an image that has branded him as an independent maverick now for more than a decade _meta_end_dot_

 he fought the gop over tobacco in _meta_number_ref_ weisman either neglected to mention or didn t know that mccain has abandoned his previous position on tobacco and now agrees with the policy he used to fight against and now the same reporter wants readers to know that other than the color of obama s skin the african american senator is much more white than black why _meta_end_question_

 because the reporter says so _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
