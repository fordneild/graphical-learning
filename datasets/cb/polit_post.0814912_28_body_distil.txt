  i honestly thought the mccain campaign s reliance on high priced corporate lobbyists couldn t be any more ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 i obviously underestimated the mccain campaign s propensity for wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 given the spate of controversies surrounding mccain and the legion of lobbyists running his campaign this is probably not welcome news for the republican presidential hopeful _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to offer voters an awful housing policy in the midst of a mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 it s altogether worse to offer an awful housing policy written by a lobbyist representing a foreign bank that would make a fortune as a result of the awful policy _meta_end_dot_

 keep the timeline in mind too _meta_end_dot_

 gramm was registered as a lobbyist for ubs through april _meta_number_ref_ despite having signed on as mccain s chief economic advisor months earlier _meta_end_dot_

 this necessarily means gramm the former senator from the great state of enron shaped mccain s housing policy and lobbied for ubs at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 adds some context to the extent of ubs s role in the subprime mortgage fiasco _meta_end_dot_

 i was trying to come up with the perfect comparison here but it looks like hilzoy beat me to it what s next the revelation that mccain s policy on iran is being written by a lobbyist for the makers of cruise missiles _meta_end_question_

 or that he has outsourced his health care policy to a lobbyist for the national funeral directors association i was going to go with taking advice on fire safety from an arsonist but hilzoy s are funnier in any case the truth is mccain picking gramm to be his chief economic policy advisor was always a spectacularly stupid thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 some of the key factors contributing to the mortgage crisis and credit crunch are the direct result of phil gramm s work in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman noted in march that most reasonable people seem to realize that we re in serious need of financial reform and expanded regulation _meta_end_dot_

 that is except gramm who s championed financial deregulation for years _meta_end_dot_

 i d argue that aside from alan greenspan nobody did as much as mr _meta_end_dot_

 gramm to make this crisis possible krugman said _meta_end_dot_

 and now the story is even worse _meta_end_dot_

 remind me again how any serious person would consider voting for mccain _meta_end_question_
