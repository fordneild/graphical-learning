  chris matthews record of creepy on air misogyny is not exactly new but it reached new depths last week with his small minded dismissal of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 after years of anti woman rhetoric this one seemed to cross the line _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully matthews seemed to get the message _meta_end_dot_

 or at a minimum his bosses seemed to get the message and told matthews to apologize _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth watching the comments were certainly welcome but are they enough _meta_end_question_

 i am too but at the risk of sounding overly demanding i found his contrition underwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing matthews didn t apologize willingly he insisted for nearly two weeks that his comments were perfectly appropriate and only backpedaled when the network started feeling the heat _meta_end_dot_

 for another matthews apology made it sound as if his misogyny problem was limited to one anti clinton diatribe _meta_end_dot_

 it s not his problem extends to other women and has for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 what i d hoped to hear is a sense that matthews realizes that he s been disrespectful to women and that he s finally ready to change his attitude _meta_end_dot_

 instead we heard one statement of contrition about one incident _meta_end_dot_

 matthews has a pattern of behavior _meta_end_dot_

 i got the sense that last night s mea culpa was as far as he s concerned the end of the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 in reality it should be just the initial step _meta_end_dot_
