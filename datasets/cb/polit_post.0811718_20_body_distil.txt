  for reasons that i ll probably never quite understand cnn invited former white house press secretary tony snow to join what the network bills as the best political team on television overlooking snow s record of well being something of a republican hack _meta_end_dot_

 snow made his debut yesterday on the situation room how did it go _meta_end_question_

 well it appears that snow is having a little trouble making the transition back to broadcasting because cnn s latest addition seems to think he s still the white house press secretary _meta_end_dot_

 i see so bush s handling of katrina was fine and mccain is just making cheap criticism for crass electoral purposes _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are running on their ideas regarding iraq healthcare the economy the environment veterans issues energy policy foreign policy and homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 they don t however have any issue other than the fact they re not george bush why this is the kind of insightful analysis you can only hear from cnn s highly paid political analysts and any fourth tier right wing blog _meta_end_dot_

 ok so to summarize according to the newest member of the best political team on television john mccain shouldn t criticize bush s handling of the hurricane katrina crisis democrats don t have any issues they care about and dick cheney is a great asset for the gop this year _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias put it this seems like right wing hackery so egregious as to be counterproductive to the cause note to cnn you paid too much _meta_end_dot_

 there are plenty of bush sycophants well in light of his _meta_percent_ref_ approval rating plenty might be a little strong who would probably be willing to go on the air and repeat pro bush talking points for a fraction of what you re paying snow _meta_end_dot_
