  after watching the president s _meta_number_ref_ minute address to congress last night i feel pretty comfortable saying the state of the union is listless frustrated and ready to move on _meta_end_dot_

 that applies equally to bush and his audience _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing is the bush white house has been offering something of a mixed message for the better part of a year _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand the president and his team insist that bush will not cease to be bold and that he is looking forward to a sprint to the finish line on the other bushies have been trying to lower expectations about this year s sotu leaking word that the president would offer nothing dramatic this year and would break no new ground _meta_end_dot_

 on the latter point i half expected that the white house was trying to execute some kind of public relations strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the bush gang would tell us in advance of the speech that the president would offer a scaled back vision of unfinished business and then surprise everyone with his ambition and innovative ideas _meta_end_dot_

 after all there s usually something of note in these state of the union addresses _meta_end_dot_

 in recent years bush has presented at least some outside the box thinking on issues ranging from social security to immigration to animal human hybrids to steroids to mars exploration _meta_end_dot_

 not too terribly long ago the president even presented a governing vision in the form of an ownership society remember that but for all the pomp and circumstance and grand political theater bush stood before the national spotlight for less than an hour last night and just didn t have much to say _meta_end_dot_

 if one is willing to suspend critical thinking skills the president is capable of reading a decent speech but as was largely the case last year the entire address felt obligatory _meta_end_dot_

 the president might as well have just skipped the event altogether he showed up rehashed some old ideas and left _meta_end_dot_

 it was a futile exercise in going through the motions _meta_end_dot_

 as president bush is for all intents and purposes contractually obligated to say the state of the union is strong it usually comes early on helping set an optimistic tone _meta_end_dot_

 last night the president saved it for the end mentioning it almost in passing _meta_end_dot_

 i got the sense he didn t want to make a claim that very few americans are willing to take seriously _meta_end_dot_

 but as david kusnet noted even this portion of the speech left the audience wanting _meta_end_dot_

 leon panetta former white house chief of staff under bill clinton n oted yesterday morning normally these state of the union speeches can be pretty drab last night would be different panetta said because the country is in deep economic crisis and americans are looking for answers from their political leaders _meta_end_dot_

 that sounded like a reasonable expectation but bush has a way of letting the nation down when it comes to providing sought after answers _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel s response to the address couldn t have been better at a time when the challenges facing our country and our economy have never been greater the american people are looking for a new direction and new leadership from washington _meta_end_dot_

 but tonight all the american people heard from the president was the same old rhetoric and the same old ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the time has come to reject the status quo and to trade no ideas for new ideas lethargy for leadership i ll flesh out some of the policy specifics in subsequent posts but when considering the big picture i realized about _meta_number_ref_ minutes after the sotu was over that i couldn t really remember a single line from the speech _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule that s not a good sign _meta_end_dot_

 for years presidents generally enjoy a modest post sotu bounce _meta_end_dot_

 americans hear the president see his vision and watch members of congress stand and applaud for him for nearly an hour _meta_end_dot_

 it s a setting that makes almost anyone look good _meta_end_dot_

 the bounce usually fades shortly thereafter once white house critics are able to start telling the public all the things wrong with the president s agenda _meta_end_dot_

 this year i don t think we ll have to wait there probably won t be a bounce because there really isn t an agenda _meta_end_dot_

 instead we have a president spinning his wheels running out the clock and anxious to let someone else clean up his mess _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough the best line i heard last night didn t come from the white house s speechwriters it came from barack obama s _meta_end_dot_

 in a video released by the senator s campaign obama said each year as we watch the state of the union we see half the chamber rise to applaud the president and half the chamber stay in their seats imagine if next year was different _meta_end_dot_

 imagine if next year the entire nation had a president they could believe in whether it s obama clinton or edwards i d certainly welcome the change _meta_end_dot_
