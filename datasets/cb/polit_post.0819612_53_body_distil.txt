  barack obama s consistent opposition to the bush mccain policy in iraq has been encouraging but in advance of an upcoming trip to baghdad obama is facing a reporter republican uproar about inconsistencies in his position which appear to exist only in the minds of his detractors at the mccain campaign the rnc and the newsrooms everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances obama is taking the offensive _meta_end_dot_

 the senator is scheduled to deliver a major policy address on iraq and national security in dc tomorrow he ll defend his policy of a _meta_number_ref_ month withdrawal and helps establish a tone for the week with an nyt op ed today _meta_end_dot_

 i noted over the weekend that the new found interest in a u s withdrawal policy among top iraqi officials gives obama an important edge _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems to agree _meta_end_dot_

 and what of the security improvements we ve seen this year _meta_end_question_

 the improvements reinforce obama s policy not undermines _meta_end_dot_

 it presents voters with a choice take advantage of the opportunity or prepare for an indefinite war followed by an indefinite military presence in a country that is ready for us to leave _meta_end_dot_

 obama s policy in no way resembles the far right caricature a _meta_number_ref_ month timeline executed in consultation with commanders on the ground mindful of conditions as they develop _meta_end_dot_

 obama would leave a residual force to target aqi protect american service members and if officials take advantage of the political opportunities train iraqi security forces _meta_end_dot_

 obama is also committed to ensuring iraq s stability through regional diplomacy and cooperation and would invest _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to a new international effort to support iraq s refugees _meta_end_dot_

 it s not precipitous it s not surrender and it s not cut and run what s more it s not a change obama is articulating the same policy with the same goals he s had throughout his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps most importantly obama does what dems have often neglected to do explain why withdrawing from iraq serves our national security interests _meta_end_dot_

 will any of this be heard over the stupidity that mars our discourse _meta_end_question_

 obama sounds optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping he s right _meta_end_dot_
