  first up from the god machine this week is an update on a report from april on the uncomfortable intersection of religion and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 one soldier who is not religious has faced considerable pressure from those who are _meta_end_dot_

 and now he has no choice but to go to court _meta_end_dot_

 at camp speicher in iraq an officer threatened to bring unspecified charges against hall because of his lack of faith _meta_end_dot_

 hall s fellow soldiers wouldn t let him sit with them at a thanksgiving meal and he was denied a promotion because of his atheism _meta_end_dot_

 cnn added hall isn t seeking compensation in his lawsuit just the guarantee of religious freedom in the military good idea now would be a good time for the pentagon to revisit its religion guidelines _meta_end_dot_

 as for hall personally he s now completing his tour of duty in junction city kansas because his superiors decided he was no longer welcome among fellow u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers to serve in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now we have a new one for the mix praying liberally _meta_end_dot_

 good idea _meta_end_dot_
