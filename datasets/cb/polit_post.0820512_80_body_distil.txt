  over the weekend iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki told der spiegel unprompted and by name that he supports barack obama s withdrawal timeline for u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the white house furiously sought to characterize this as a transcription error while the mccain campaign insisted that maliki s words had been taken out of context now we ve known for a couple of days that the republican talking points on this are completely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times reviewed the recording of the interview and found that the der spiegel transcript was exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 but in case there were any lingering doubts several news outlets are still characterizing the original maliki quotes as being in dispute the iraqi prime minister actually received a copy of the interview before it went to print _meta_end_dot_

 he had the opportunity to make changes but chose not to _meta_end_dot_

 kevin added the interview was conducted in english maliki s arabic answers were then translated into english by maliki s own translator and the completed transcript was later provided to maliki for his approval before publication _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully this will be the last word on whether or not maliki really meant what he said noted when a guy you more or less install in power and keep there on a very short leash starts going off the reservation you first claim there was some sort of translation error _meta_end_dot_

 then you claim that what he says is not what he means _meta_end_dot_

 when he continues to reiterate the point you assert that he knows not of what he speaks and now that none of the talking points can rationalize the prime minister s remarks the white house isn t sure what to do _meta_end_dot_
