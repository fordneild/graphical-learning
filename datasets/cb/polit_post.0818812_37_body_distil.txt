  barack obama spoke to reporters yesterday aboard the campaign plane and was still puzzled as to why news outlets rushed to report that he d changed his approach to iraq when he d done nothing of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 in turn reporters didn t seem especially pleased to be blamed and so we got items like this one _meta_end_dot_

 even now the nyt s jeff zeleny is trying to characterize this as something of a shift _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday his report indicated obama blamed himself for the confusion so he held a second press conference _meta_end_dot_

 on saturday obama didn t blame himself but rather pointed to irresponsible reporting _meta_end_dot_

 this is all terribly silly _meta_end_dot_

 when obama held a second press conference on thursday it was because he saw the misguided media frenzy and thought he needed to set reporters straight _meta_end_dot_

 when obama suggested he hadn t been clear enough he was being polite he was no doubt tempted to say since you guys are running stories that manufacture a story out of nothing i should probably explain why you re being foolish obama couldn t say that though without incurring reporters wrath again _meta_end_dot_

 i was a little puzzled by the frenzy that i set off by what i thought was a pretty innocuous statement he said speaking on saturday about the episode for the first time _meta_end_dot_

 i am absolutely committed to ending the war of course he is _meta_end_dot_

 obama always has been and nothing he said on thursday changed that _meta_end_dot_

 but now that a couple of days have passed since the media s overwrought freak out it s worth considering what happened here _meta_end_dot_

 i find this especially odd since reporters actually want the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate is overly cautious calculating every syllable in advance for fear of misguided reporters piranhas going berserk the candidate is slammed for being programmed and scripted _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate talks like a person the same reporters remind us that the candidate should be calibrating and measuring every single word great _meta_end_dot_

 i d argue though that this was actually an example of pre spin _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign told reporters over and over again that obama would reverse course on his withdrawal policy _meta_end_dot_

 reporters not only bought it they sought out evidence to reinforce it measuring every word obama said in the hopes of plugging the quote into the agreed upon prediction narrative _meta_end_dot_

 when obama said refine reporters said a ha it didn t make any sense it was another disservice to the public but it s a lesson about how the game is played _meta_end_dot_
