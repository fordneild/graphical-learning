  believe it or not newt gingrich and sean hannity are still even now laughing like school children over the notion of properly inflated tires _meta_end_dot_

 after hannity described this nonsense as one of his favorite stories of all time gingrich explained well i got a very funny e mail from a retired military officer in tampa who pointed out that most tire inflation is done at service stations and you pay for it _meta_end_dot_

 and it s actually a higher profit margin than selling gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 so sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama was urging you to go out and enrich big oil by inflating your tires instead of buying gas a lot of republicans have said a lot of stupid things about energy policy in recent weeks but this may very well be the single most inane comment any of them have uttered publicly _meta_end_dot_

 worse than a house republican from texas exclaiming let s bring up the paris hilton plan _meta_end_question_

 yes even worse than that ben at tp valiantly goes to the trouble of pointing out why gingrich s argument is demonstrably ridiculous explaining why tire maintenance is a good idea and wouldn t enrich big oil but i d just add that it s worth remembering just how idiotic newt gingrich s worldview can be _meta_end_dot_

 about a year ago the wapo s david broder said the former house speaker has earned the label visionary that s absurd gingrich is a little more than pseudo scholarly nut _meta_end_dot_

 we talked recently about some of his greatest hits including gingrich s sincere arguments such as the notion that the homeless should get laptops and that women shouldn t be permitted to serve in combat roles because males are biologically driven to go out and hunt giraffes but poking around a bit last night i was also reminded of gingrich s habit for blaming liberals government and liberal government for just about every societal ill he can identify _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ after susan smith drowned her two young sons newt gingrich just three days before the midterm elections equated her crime with the values of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 gingrich told the ap the mother killing her two children in south carolina vividly reminds every american how sick the society is getting and how much we have to have change _meta_end_dot_

 i think people want to change and the only way you get change is to vote republican _meta_end_dot_

 that s the message for the last three days in _meta_number_ref_ shortly after the columbine massacre gingrich argued that american elites bear responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 i want to say to the elite of this country the elite news media the liberal academic elite the liberal political elite i accuse you in littleton of being afraid to talk about the mess you have made gingrich said and being afraid to take responsibility for things you have done and instead foisting upon the rest of us pathetic banalities because you don t have the courage to look at the world you have created last year after the shootings at virginia tech gingrich blamed liberals for supporting situation ethics adding yes i think the fact is if you look at the amount of violence we have in games that young people play at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years of age if you look at the dehumanization if you look at the fact that we refuse to say that we are in fact endowed by our creator that our rights come from god that if you kill somebody you re committing an act of evil gingrich explaining the vt tragedy went on to condemn halloween costumes and the mccain feingold campaign finance law _meta_end_dot_

 broder may think this clown is a visionary and the dc establishment may perceive him as some kind of big thinker but i look at gingrich and see a strange partisan hack with a phd _meta_end_dot_
