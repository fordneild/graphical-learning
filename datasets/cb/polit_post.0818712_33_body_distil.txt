  as a rule there s very little point in critiquing charles krauthammer columns _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit like correcting george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s grammar the errors are obvious but a little too easy _meta_end_dot_

 but krauthammer s latest column a semi coherent anti obama rant published yesterday was an embarrassment to himself and the publication that ran it the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 by any reasonable measure the man has the intellectual seriousness of a house plant _meta_end_dot_

 most of the initial attacks are just trite _meta_end_dot_

 obama disdained flag lapel pins _meta_end_dot_

 he seduc ed the hard core moveon democrats he had last year s most liberal voting record in the senate which is still a ridiculous claim by the way _meta_end_dot_

 he s guilty of brazen reversals of position and abandonment of principles an attack i continue to find bewildering in light of john mccain s dozens of high profile flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 but krauthammer soon shifted from pedantic hackery to outright deception by attacking obama for reversing course on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 why the post didn t just reject such tripe out of hand is a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 didn t happen based on nothing more than his own ability to manufacture bogus narratives _meta_end_dot_

 so what we get is a column that argues obama will abandon his commitment to with a withdrawal policy when all evidence points to the opposite conclusion and an argument that obama already has abandoned his commitment to with a withdrawal policy when all evidence points to the opposite conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t even gone to iraq and the flip is almost complete if by flip krauthammer means embraces the exact same policy that he s consistently maintained for over a year then sure he s absolutely right _meta_end_dot_

 if however we speak and understand english than krauthammer is trying to con readers into believing something that is clearly and demonstrably false _meta_end_dot_

 note to the washington post editorial page the purpose of op ed columns is to provide analysis context and commentary on current events not to give unhinged ideologues a forum to publish obvious untruths _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer actually goes so far as to argue that obama is assiduously obliterat ing all differences with mccain on national security and social issues which of course is pure fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 i ll just let yglesias take it from here
