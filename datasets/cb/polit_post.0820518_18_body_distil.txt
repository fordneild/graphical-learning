  in a dramatic error yesterday john mccain told katie couric that it s just a matter of history that bush s surge policy began the anbar awakening that of course is backwards _meta_end_dot_

 today thanks to some efforts by the obama campaign the media started picking up on mccain s bizarre confusion on his signature national security issue most notably with coverage from the ap and cnn _meta_end_dot_

 as of this earlier afternoon the best the mccain campaign could come up with was this democrats can debate whether the awakening would have survived without the surge but that is nothing more than a transparent effort to minimize the role of our commanders and our troops in defeating the enemy got that _meta_end_question_

 if you think _meta_number_ref_ came before _meta_number_ref_ you re somehow showing disrespect for the troops _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign then got a little more creative _meta_end_dot_

 this one s more interesting so let s unpack it a bit _meta_end_dot_

 as spin goes that s pretty creative _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t make it right _meta_end_dot_

 first the mccain campaign is making a case that s supported by practically nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the vast majority of the troops involved with the surge went to baghdad not anbar the latter of which saw one u s _meta_end_dot_

 brigade _meta_end_dot_

 did the presence of this brigade make the surge successful _meta_end_question_

 it can t be disproven but it s hardly the accepted consensus either _meta_end_dot_

 second and more importantly the latest spin is disconnected to what mccain you know actually said _meta_end_dot_

 mccain insisted that the surge began the anbar awakening it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 in fact to hear mccain tell it the only awakening the surge happened not succeeded but happened is the surge which is clearly false _meta_end_dot_

 all the after the fact rationalizing won t change this obvious mistake _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely reporters would have had a few more questions for mccain about his latest confusion at his press conference this afternoon but around the time the ap story about mccain s error hit the wires the campaign cancelled the press conference _meta_end_dot_

 was the cancellation connected to the desire to avoid questions about this _meta_end_question_

 your guess is as good as mine _meta_end_dot_

 and what about cbs news which conveniently helped cover up mccain s mistake _meta_end_question_

 the network issued a statement this afternoon this isn t especially helpful _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s confusion wasn t especially lengthy there was plenty of time to air it _meta_end_dot_

 considering it was arguably the most important mistake either candidate has made all year which of course makes it newsworthy you d think cbs would choose to make time for it _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the statement doesn t explain why cbs aired couric s question in full but spliced the interview together to air a different less embarrassing answer to a different question _meta_end_dot_
