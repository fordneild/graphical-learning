  a few months ago there was quite a stir over whether reagan employed a divisive southern strategy in _meta_number_ref_ starting his campaign with a speech supporting states rights in philadelphia miss _meta_end_dot_

 the same town where three civil rights workers had been murdered _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i was a little surprised to see that john mccain was kicking off a major campaign tour yesterday in meridian miss not far from reagan s kick off point _meta_end_dot_

 another instance of the gop s southern strategy _meta_end_question_

 it s possible but a closer look suggests mccain picked the mississippi town for family history reasons _meta_end_dot_

 to say that mccain was laying it on thick would be an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign is billing this as a biographical tour but if yesterday was any indication mccain is actually making this a look who i m related to tour he seems to be the first candidate in recent memory to make family history highly relevant to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in yesterday s speech mccain noted many mccains left here as young men to pursue careers in what has long been our family s chosen profession the united states armed forces we trace my family s martial heritage back to the revolution _meta_end_dot_

 a distant ancestor served on general washington s staff and it seems my ancestors fought in most wars in our nation s history _meta_end_dot_

 all were soldiers both henry and bill mccain were west pointers until my grandfather broke family tradition and entered the naval academy in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he was succeeded there by my father then me and then my son and in case anyone missed all of these subtleties the mccain campaign released a new web video about the senator s family history with an emphasis on those who became military leaders _meta_end_dot_

 restrained it is not _meta_end_dot_

 ed kilgore had a very sharp post on this noting that he couldn t recall any major speech by a president or presidential candidate that was devoted so thoroughly to the subject of the speaker s own family background not just the immediate family but the family heritage good point _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that watching the campaign s new web video and reading yesterday s speech i also kept thinking about mccain s first general election tv ad which emphasized that he s the american president america has been waiting for i m reluctant to over analyze all of this but if republicans are anxious to define obama as foreign unusual name kenyan father international relatives mccain bragging excessively about his family history may be a subtle way for the gop candidate to argue i m an american through and through unlike some people i won t mention too cynical _meta_end_question_
