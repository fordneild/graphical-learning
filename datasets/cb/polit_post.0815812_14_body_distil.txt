  for far right republicans when nothing else is working in the midst of a political campaign they always seem to go back to the same thing the good ol red scare _meta_end_dot_

 take tom delay for example _meta_end_dot_

 the former house majority leader took time away from his criminal defense delay is currently facing felony counts of money laundering and conspiracy in texas to appear on right wing talk show host mike gallagher s radio show yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 when the subject turned to the presidential campaign the former exterminator went after barack obama i have said publicly and i will again that unless he proves me wrong he is a marxist gallagher agreed saying t hat s what he is there are a couple of angles to consider here _meta_end_dot_

 first this is the same delay who just a few months ago lambasted john mccain for betraying the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 he said he s prepared to sit this election out if mccain won the republican nomination and told fox news there s nothing redeeming about john mccain i guess he s come around _meta_end_dot_

 and second the near constant red baiting from high profile republicans has clearly pushed the gop beyond the realm of contemporary political norms _meta_end_dot_

 these guys are desperate and panic appears to have set in but that s hardly an excuse for a red scare _meta_end_dot_

 noted that the right has been engaged in quite a bit of this talk lately about the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 i d add that texas gov _meta_end_dot_

 rick perry r whom no one has ever accused of being a mental giant picked up on this recently blasting obama for having a socialist agenda and it s not just targeted at obama specifically _meta_end_dot_

 fox news invited an analyst on recently to argue what worries me about the democrats is that if you listen to them their message is so explicitly socialist _meta_end_dot_

 i mean at every opportunity they seem to have this contempt for capitalism similarly cnn s glenn beck went on a tirade in january arguing that hillary clinton s policy agenda sounds like the soviet union he labeled her comrade clinton and said of john edwards now put a red star on his furry head _meta_end_dot_

 he s a communist it s become something of a republican fall back position _meta_end_dot_

 when the _meta_number_ref_th congress was taking office last year redstate created a graphic that read democrat socialists take back congress there was a hammer and sickle in the middle and the background image is of the evacuation of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 embassy of saigon _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when some raised questions about the propriety of lawmakers attending retreats sponsored by corporate lobbyists then rep _meta_end_dot_

 james gibbons r nev said anybody who is against that obviously must be a communist in _meta_number_ref_ then sen _meta_end_dot_

 trent lott r miss called john kerry a french speaking socialist sen _meta_end_dot_

 gordon smith r ore said kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism around the same time bill o reilly called paul krugman a quasi socialist and compared david brock s media matters to fidel castro s communist regime _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate the fact that republicans probably get a little tired of calling someone a liberal but that s no reason to start manufacturing a red scare _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 there should be some political norms that conservatives still care about _meta_end_dot_

 the right gets pretty worked up when the left starts throwing around the word fascist oddly enough though the ease with which they talk about communism appears effortless _meta_end_dot_
