  if last week s democratic debate in texas seemed a little too cordial given the political climate last night s debate in cleveland featured some of the conflict the political world craved _meta_end_dot_

 this very well may have been hillary clinton s last opportunity to take some rhetorical shots at barack obama and possibly throw him off his game on the national stage and she seemed anxious to take advantage of the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 clinton went after obama on healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 and trade _meta_end_dot_

 and iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and direct mail the importance of speeches the importance of supporters and her general displeasure with campaign tactics _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt called it one of her most pugnacious debate performances of the campaign which sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 the problem though is that it s not at all clear if any of these swings actually connected _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as far as i can tell it seemed obama who wasn t at all thrown off his game seemed to get the better of most of the exchanges _meta_end_dot_

 take for example the discussion over obama winning praise from farrakhan which obama said he rejects _meta_end_dot_

 to me it sounded like obama came across as gracious while clinton wanted to debate the meaning of the word reject all on an issue few really care about anyway _meta_end_dot_

 said i suspect most people watching would agree _meta_end_dot_

 it s a contested presidential campaign and the candidates are going to take the occasional cheap shot _meta_end_dot_

 was obama s mailing problematic _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 was it considerably worse than some of clinton s mailings _meta_end_question_

 not at all _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone really care about a debate over campaign tactics _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 as noam scheiber put it this seemed to be part of a pattern _meta_end_dot_

 even on iraq clinton tried to emphasize how similar her voting record is to obama s which only gave obama another opportunity to remind us who got iraq right _meta_end_dot_

 what s more when clinton wasn t going after obama she was going after the media citing a saturday night live skit as evidence for being too tough on her and not tough enough on obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that her argument lacked merit it s that the whole series of complaints sounded kind of petty _meta_end_dot_

 her comments drew the night s only boos from the audience there s nothing wrong with going on the offensive but clinton has some ground to make up and few if any of her rhetorical shots seemed to leave her in a better position _meta_end_dot_

 in most instances they seemed to come up short offering obama a chance to capitalize _meta_end_dot_

 overall i d say obama helped himself quite a bit last night and clinton came up short _meta_end_dot_

 given who s winning that s not at all what clinton was hoping for _meta_end_dot_

 what did you think _meta_end_question_
