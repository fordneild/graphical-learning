  remember conservative activists are convinced that cnn is unfriendly territory for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 that is except for all the ones the network keeps hiring _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to use this as an excuse to tell another predictable joke about the not so liberal media ok i m not going to just do that _meta_end_dot_

 instead i think there are two broader angles that are worth considering here _meta_end_dot_

 first is the fact that snow spent his tenure misleading reporters and by extension the public _meta_end_dot_

 at times i was amazed reporters showed up for his briefings at all given that snow had stopped trying to be taken seriously at all repeating obviously false talking points with a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 tim f _meta_end_dot_

 makes the argument persuasively that snow might be the one singular high level bush appointee who showed a basic ability to do his job _meta_end_dot_

 he ran the press in circles of bullshit and empty phrases but one could say that is the press secretary s primary job _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t out any cia agents _meta_end_dot_

 if the cable channels must pay someone to repeat right slanted nonsense every few hours and it s pointless pretending that won t happen i honestly prefer snow to most of the alternatives that s pretty compelling actually but i nevertheless find cnn s attitude backwards _meta_end_dot_

 snow s on the job performance was comparable to baghdad bob s to the point that snow simply wasn t credible speaking on any subject _meta_end_dot_

 why reward that with a spot on the best political team on television _meta_end_question_

 does cnn really need another conservative voice to spin the news _meta_end_question_

 and yet the moment presidential aides leave the west wing media outlets jump at the chance to put them on the payroll _meta_end_dot_

 michael gerson was picked up as a columnist for the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 sara taylor who was integrally involved in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney purge scandal and the politicization of federal agencies became a pundit for msnbc _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove became a fox news analyst a columnist for newsweek and a columnist for the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 and now tony snow has parlayed his mendacity into a gig on cnn _meta_end_dot_

 why would a liberal media keep giving jobs to members of the bush gang _meta_end_question_

 because working the refs works _meta_end_dot_
