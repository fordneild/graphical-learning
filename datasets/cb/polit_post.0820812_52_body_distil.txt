  remember the first two weeks of july when the big story of the presidential campaign was that barack obama moved or was about to move towards john mccain s position on iraq policy _meta_end_question_

 the story was a fantasy based on literally nothing but it dominated the political discourse for weeks _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign went so far as to put out a statement arguing that obama has now adopted john mccain s position on troop withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 and the irony is the entire story was backwards _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t move towards mccain mccain has moved towards obama _meta_end_dot_

 the first substantive hint came this week when a mccain surrogate appeared on a campaign conference call to argue that obama has a _meta_number_ref_ month withdrawal timetable but mccain might withdraw u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops from iraq even sooner _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday on cnn mccain took this to the next level suggesting the policy proposed by obama and endorsed by iraqi officials sounds like a pretty good timetable for those who can t watch clips online cnn s wolf blitzer asked mccain what he d do if maliki persisted and wanted u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops to withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 mccain ignoring maliki s repeated public pronouncements said he knows maliki so well mccain is certain that he can ignore maliki s public statements _meta_end_dot_

 asked why maliki would describe the _meta_number_ref_ month policy as a pretty good timetable mccain said he said it s a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a pretty good timetable as we should or horizons for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 but they have to be based on conditions on the ground this is what those in the biz call going off message isn t a pretty good timetable indeed mccain has repeatedly said the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 what actually sounds pretty good to mccain is the policy he s been advocating for quite a while now an indefinite war which ends in some undefined state of victory followed by an indefinite presence that could last _meta_number_ref_ years or more _meta_end_dot_

 if you re starting to get the impression mccain will simply say anything to win we re on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 tp also raised a very important point i hadn t thought of _meta_end_dot_

 during the republican primaries mccain hammered mitt romney for hinting at support for a conditions based timetable for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 in a debate mccain was indignant timetables was the buzzword for those that wanted to get out in other words when romney dared to suggest a timetable was a good idea mccain thought it was a dreadful mistake because the word timetable in and of itself was loaded with policy implications _meta_end_dot_

 and who s using the word now senator _meta_end_question_

 so far the nyt is playing up this story but most other outlets aren t _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if it gains any traction _meta_end_dot_
