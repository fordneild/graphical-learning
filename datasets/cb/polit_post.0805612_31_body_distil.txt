  over the weekend we officially passed the fifth anniversary of the creation of the carpetbagger report so i thought i d take a moment to offer a quick note of thanks to readers _meta_end_dot_

 i generally avoid navel gazing posts consider it a once a year indulgence _meta_end_dot_

 besides as far as the blogosphere goes five years seems like a fairly significant milestone to borrow a presidential cliche the state of the blog is strong _meta_end_dot_

 over the last year traffic has grown at a surprisingly fast clip and the comments section has flourished into a spirited community _meta_end_dot_

 the relative success of the blog has led to a variety of other terrific opportunities for me over the last year including much to my surprise a short film _meta_end_dot_

 we also unveiled a redesigned home page over the last year which has not only improved the look and feel of the site but which seems to have been met with near universal approval from readers _meta_end_dot_

 as for major changes for the carpetbagger report as we enter year six i don t plan on making any _meta_end_dot_

 i sometimes wonder what if anything i should consider to take the blog to the next level diaries _meta_end_question_

 videos _meta_end_question_

 partnerships with other bloggers _meta_end_question_

 but in general i m pretty satisfied _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure if a major media outlet asked me to write an in house blog a la drum sullivan greenwald yglesias i d welcome the opportunity but in the meantime i m not going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 if you keep reading i ll keep writing _meta_end_dot_

 and to reiterate a point i emphasize every year about this time i d also like to take a moment to thank all of you for being here _meta_end_dot_

 whether you ve been reading for five years or five days it s a real honor _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate your interest support and encouragement and i m grateful that so many of you are willing to peruse my daily tirades _meta_end_dot_

 and now back to the news _meta_end_dot_
