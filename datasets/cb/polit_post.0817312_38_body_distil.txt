  guest post by morbo sometimes a political party faces a congressional district that is firmly held by the opposition party with no chance of flipping _meta_end_dot_

 there are two ways to react to that recruit someone to fall on his sword and lose with dignity or allow nature to take its course and have an apparent crackpot seek the seat _meta_end_dot_

 republicans in maryland facing a special election last week opted for the latter _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_th congressional district was formerly held by al wynn _meta_end_dot_

 wynn stepped down after losing a primary election to donna edwards in february _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows edwards will take the seat in november _meta_end_dot_

 no republican has ever managed to capture more than _meta_number_ref_ percent of the votes in the solidly democratic area _meta_end_dot_

 but wynn s decision to step down early forced a special election which was held a few days ago _meta_end_dot_

 edwards ran for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans nominated a man named peter james _meta_end_dot_

 james as the washington post politely put it brings unusual monetary views to the race _meta_end_dot_

 he believes in the creation of local currencies and refuses to get a driver s license because he fears the government collecting data on him _meta_end_dot_

 reported the post james knows some of his ideas are unconventional he told the newspaper my campaign manager told me don t say things that make you seem too crazy one of james most ardent backers is ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 are you surprised in any case the dr _meta_end_dot_

 paul revolutionaries failed to do much for james on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 turnout for the special election was extremely low with james capturing _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 james will probably run against edwards again in november _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly hope so _meta_end_dot_

 i m thinking that if he keeps talking he can manage to drop below even _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_
