 this morning mccain dropped another aide energy lobbyist eric burgeson who had lobbied for qatar and serbia _meta_end_dot_

 the problems have led the mccain campaign to do what it never thought to do before vet the staff _meta_end_dot_

 tom loeffler and his firm have made approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ million in their contracts representing the saudi arabian government aide peter madigan represented the government of the united arab emirates in a class action suit regarding the enslavement of children as camel jockeys but at the top of the list is charles black mccain s senior campaign strategist _meta_end_dot_

 ol charlie was on fox news yesterday blasting obama for his willingness to meet with unsavory characters like iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that black hasn t just met with a motley international crew he s represented them as their lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 indeed black has quite a client list including but by no means limited to iraq iran s ahmad chalabi mobutu sese seko ferdinand marcos somalia s mohamed siad barre nigeria s ibrahim babangida and angola s would be dictator jonas savimbi _meta_end_dot_
