  for a couple of generations every major presidential candidate from both parties has taken the same position on u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy towards cuba keep the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 the embargo needs to stay in place in order to keep the pressure on castro _meta_end_dot_

 any thawing in relations would be a victory for a brutal thug and would enrage a powerful voting bloc cuban americans in a key electoral state florida _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind no candidate has been willing to talk openly about a change _meta_end_dot_

 i distinctly remember in _meta_number_ref_ when wesley clark said in a debate he wanted a dramatic shake up in the existing policy _meta_end_dot_

 when you isolate a country you strengthen the dictators in it clark said _meta_end_dot_

 the next day clark s campaign backpedaled after aides heard from supporters in miami _meta_end_dot_

 this year chris dodd and barack obama went out on a limb and said the status quo isn t good enough and had the audacity to point that the current policy doesn t actually work _meta_end_dot_

 they no doubt expected republicans to try to exploit this but made the case anyway _meta_end_dot_

 dodd stepped aside in january but obama is poised to be the first democratic candidate in a half century to offer a real change when it comes to cuba _meta_end_dot_

 today john mccain intends to smack him on it pretty hard in a speech in miami _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously an off shoot of the debate over iran mccain believes the silent treatment is an effective foreign policy in relation to rivals and enemies obama believes the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain is apparently prepared to argue that bush s policy towards cuba hasn t been far enough to the right _meta_end_dot_

 bloomberg reported today as for obama s willingness to change u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy and consider diplomacy with cuba mccain will say open discussions would send the worst possible signal to cuba s dictators the conventional wisdom suggests mccain s criticism will be well received in south florida and obama will face a serious push back on this _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not at all sure the conventional wisdom is right on this _meta_end_dot_

 michael tomasky noted yesterday maybe so _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama s willingness to break with a failed status quo may turn out to be a political winner after all _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t get a lot of attention but there s a big distinction between cuban exiles who fled to the united states and their children s generation _meta_end_dot_

 the younger cuban americans are far less conservative and far more open to a policy change _meta_end_dot_

 obama assumes probably correctly that the older generation isn t going to vote for a democrat anyway so why not shake up the dynamic by reaching out with a common sense policy that has the added benefit of appealing to younger cuban american voters _meta_end_question_

 mccain assumes the rules haven t changed in decades _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see soon enough if he s right _meta_end_dot_
