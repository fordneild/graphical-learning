  it s hardly a secret that the republican presidential field is surprisingly weak and unimpressive which has contributed to a gop malaise _meta_end_dot_

 poll after poll has shown democratic voters enthusiastic about their choices while republican voters generally feel the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth pausing from time to time to realize just how feeble this field really is _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this is likely to change _meta_end_dot_

 once each party has a nominee the gop base will probably rally both behind their candidate and in strident opposition to the dem _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime considering the republican landscape none of the above is surprisingly appealing _meta_end_dot_

 to quantify this a bit richard bond a former chairman of the republican national committee noted data that showed a _meta_number_ref_ point intensity gap between the republicans and the democrats looking ahead to the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that is a monster number bond said _meta_end_dot_

 it shows that the republicans are not fired up and it s going to take a nominee who can clearly articulate a post bush vision for the country sure as adam nagourney notes the democratic nominee might fire up the gop before voters head to the polls but what does it say about the modern republican party that they need a dem to save their electoral chances _meta_end_question_
