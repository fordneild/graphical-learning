  the god machine turns its attention this week exclusively to mike huckabee and some of his more notable and less well known friends _meta_end_dot_

 anyone watching the presidential campaign probably knows about huckabee s background as a baptist preacher _meta_end_dot_

 political observers have also no doubt picked up on huckabee s vaguely theocratic campaign platform which includes among other things his stated intention to bring the united states constitution in line with god s standards when asked to clarify huckabee said we have nothing to worry about he doesn t want to make the constitution fit god s standards in general he just wants to make the constitution fit god s standards when it comes to gays and reproductive rights _meta_end_dot_

 all of this seems rather alarming of course to those of us who care about church state separation and our secular system of government _meta_end_dot_

 it gets even scarier when we consider huckabee s ties to christian reconstructionists _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure reconstructionists are not exactly a household name and they re clearly on the fringe of modern american thought _meta_end_dot_

 as my friend morbo explained this morning reconstructionists basically hold that our constitutional system is flawed and needs to be replaced with a christian theocracy _meta_end_dot_

 they re significantly to the right of the robertson dobson wing of the religious right in that reconstructionists believe u s _meta_end_dot_

 laws should be based on the legal codes of the old testament _meta_end_dot_

 literally _meta_end_dot_

 some in the movement also believe in biblical penalties including stoning for various sins the good news is reconstructionists are very small in number _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is mike huckabee has been hanging out with quite a few of them _meta_end_dot_

 an answer that was less than reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly a denunciation _meta_end_dot_

 and the likely reason huckabee was cautious in describing his associations with reconstructionists is because of his ties to the movement _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday in salon alex koppelman and vincent rossmeier offer a detailed report _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s ties to these guys are not random and incidental _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying huckabee is a reconstructionist but it s hard to dismiss the significance of his connections to these scary religious figures _meta_end_dot_

 it s not unusual to see and hear reasonable people say nice things about huckabee citing his warm personality his sense of humor and his willingness to appear regularly on the colbert report _meta_end_dot_

 i just hope these same people look beyond the surface _meta_end_dot_
