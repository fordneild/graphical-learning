  i haven t seen any polls on this but in general i have to assume the two words that voters care about least are committee hearing it s not that they re trivial hearings can actually be extremely important but for the typical american committee hearings probably sound pretty boring _meta_end_dot_

 but for whatever reason the mccain campaign has decided that barack obama s failure to hold a subcommittee hearing on afghanistan over the last year and a half is a critically important development _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has harped on this point repeatedly his surrogates have tried to emphasize the profundity of this oversight and the mccain campaign even went after obama on the hearing issue in its new tv ad _meta_end_dot_

 as long as the mccain gang is going to the trouble of raising a fuss about committee hearings we might as well go to the trouble of pointing out how foolish this is _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain s argument at first blush makes some sense _meta_end_dot_

 if a lawmaker takes afghanistan seriously the lawmaker would find take hearings about afghanistan seriously _meta_end_dot_

 the problem though is that by mccain s own standard he doesn t appear to care about afghanistan at all _meta_end_dot_

 do i care if mccain showed up for senate armed service committee hearings on afghanistan _meta_end_question_

 not especially _meta_end_dot_

 but if mccain really wants to make committee hearings an important campaign issue then great let s make committee hearings an important campaign issue _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden explains why this criticism doesn t make any sense either _meta_end_dot_

 truth be told by the time a campaign gets to let s argue about subcommittee hearings on the list of talking points you have to assume the campaign is struggling to come up with anything interesting to say at all _meta_end_dot_

 but even if we accept the mccain campaign s premise mccain still doesn t know what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t shown up for any of the hearings on afghanistan and the attacks on the nato subcommittee can t withstand even minimal scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 isn t this supposed to be the new and improved mccain team _meta_end_question_

 with the new campaign manager and political operation _meta_end_question_

 are these supposed to be the sharp guys who ll run the campaign like a finely tuned machine _meta_end_question_

 it looks to me like these guys need help _meta_end_dot_
