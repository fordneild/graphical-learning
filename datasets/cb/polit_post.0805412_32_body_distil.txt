  since the nyt story about john mccain and vicki iseman broke on wednesday there have been two angles to the controversy one of which clearly looked stronger than the other _meta_number_ref_ mccain s alleged romance with this telecom lobbyist and _meta_number_ref_ mccain s professional efforts to help the lobbyist s client _meta_end_dot_

 the senator and his campaign have rejected both points _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence pointing to the alleged adultery is still elusive but the evidence that mccain has lied about his efforts on behalf of iseman s client keeps piling up _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday the mccain campaign said in writing that no representative of paxson or alcalde _meta_number_ref_ fay personally asked senator mccain to send a letter to the fcc on its behalf _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday newsweek reported that mccain gave a deposition in _meta_number_ref_ in which he contradicted his own claim _meta_end_dot_

 today the wapo makes matters worse for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s safe to say this is going to get worse for the presumptive republican presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and then years later with the pressure on mccain lied about his efforts _meta_end_dot_

 and got caught _meta_end_dot_

 i think there s a perception in many circles that the nyt story was a dud because the paper hadn t nailed down the adultery angle _meta_end_dot_

 maybe so _meta_end_dot_

 but the article has nevertheless created quite a headache for mccain for reasons that have nothing to do with any inappropriate relationships _meta_end_dot_

 the appearance of corruption certainly isn t helpful especially given the perception of integrity mccain has worked so hard to sell but reporters seem to be waking up to the fact that the senator and his campaign have tried to deceive people _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule journalists a don t care for that and b perceive this as a sign of trouble causing them to dig deeper _meta_end_dot_
