  at a certain point a couple of months ago news outlets decided that barack obama s association with jeremiah wright was the single most important facet of this year s presidential campaign at least so far _meta_end_dot_

 how could a presidential hopeful have a relationship with an intemperate pastor _meta_end_question_

 who s said nutty things _meta_end_question_

 what does it say about obama s judgment that it took him a while to denounce wright personally _meta_end_question_

 and then there s john mccain who is also associated with a motley crew of radical religious zealots and who has largely been given a pass by the media _meta_end_dot_

 we ve talked about mccain cozying up to jerry falwell even after falwell blamed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on americans and we ve talked about mccain befriending john hagee even after hagee called the catholic church a great whore and a false cult system but rod parsley probably hasn t generated the kind of attention he should _meta_end_dot_

 consider for example this new clip put together by brave new films and mother jones _meta_end_dot_

 you ll notice of course that despite parsley s record of sheer lunacy mccain nevertheless said he was honored to have parsley s support _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain who recently denounced obama for some of his associations and demanded that obama apologize for people he knows called parsley one of the truly great leaders in america a moral compass and a spiritual guide rod parsley is by most decent standards something of a religious fanatic _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain not only treats him as some kind of hero mccain also reached out for his political support and has refused to distance himself from either parsley or parsley s record of insane rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 i m still reluctant to play the guilt by association game colbert labeled it collateral friendage this week but i m looking for some sense of fairness here _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t find any _meta_end_dot_

 goes well beyond one religious minority _meta_end_dot_

 best of all his rhetoric frequently includes what sounds like appeals to violence telling his followers i came to incite a riot _meta_end_exclamation_

 man your battle stations _meta_end_dot_

 ready your weapons one wants to assume he s speaking metaphorically but it s not entirely clear indeed the new video clip is great at highlighting parsley s unhinged attitude towards muslims but my friends at right wing watch put together their own video with some more of this clown s greatest hits _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week tim russert said the media would pay more attention to mccain s radical preacher allies if there was video well guess what tim you re in luck _meta_end_dot_

 all you have to do now is put it on the air _meta_end_dot_

 post script i realize the obvious response from republicans is that the wright situation matters far more because obama was a member of wright s christian congregation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain belongs to a church but falwell parsley and hagee were never mccain s pastor _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never found this compelling _meta_end_dot_

 mccain sought out the support of crazy people whom most decent people would find pretty offensive at least as offensive as wright _meta_end_dot_

 he knew or at least should have known about their insane worldviews but nevertheless cozied up to them asked for their support campaigned with them publicly praised them and refused to denounce them _meta_end_dot_

 no he never sat in their pews _meta_end_dot_

 but how does that make it better _meta_end_question_

 if obama sought out louis farrakhan campaigned with him praised him capitalized on his endorsement and then hesitated to denounce him would the media give him a pass _meta_end_question_

 would dems be able to argue that it doesn t matter because obama was never a member of farrakhan s house of worship _meta_end_question_
