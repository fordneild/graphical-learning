  there comes a point at which the rank stupidity of campaign coverage makes one wonder why anyone would even want to run for national office in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 when barack obama detractors spent yesterday afternoon speculating over whether he d flipped hillary clinton off it was just such a time _meta_end_dot_

 this one is truly mind numbing and enough to suggest a few too many political observers might want to stop sniffing glue _meta_end_dot_

 obama was giving a speech and ironically enough commenting on the need to move beyond trivial distractions _meta_end_dot_

 apparently during his remarks he had an itch on his face _meta_end_dot_

 he scratched it _meta_end_dot_

 this to hear some tell it was obama s way of giving clinton a one finger salute _meta_end_dot_

 john cole noted one far right observer who insisted that obama gave hillary the finger and one clinton supporter who said he cannot believe the obama campaign is promoting the clip of the senator s speech since he flips off hillary clinton in the video this was not simply limited to otherwise bored bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc and foxnews com also treated this as a news item of note _meta_end_dot_

 in fact msnbc asserted that obama made an unfortunate gesture i know i shouldn t be surprised and yet i never thought we d reach the point at which momentary facial itches would rise to the level of national significance worthy of broadcast to a national television audience _meta_end_dot_

 from a different angle and he used two fingers not one _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes a scratch is just a scratch second when msnbc anchor contessa brewer was done giving this story airtime on national television she concluded hey folks they don t call this the silly season for nothing no _meta_end_dot_

 sorry _meta_end_dot_

 if brewer were highlighting the story to suggest that ridiculous bloggers obsess over meaningless minutiae in other words if she put this on the air to demonstrate how stupid the controversy was it would merely be a brief waste of airtime _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not what happened here _meta_end_dot_

 brewer treated this as a legitimate issue worthy of a mention on national television _meta_end_dot_

 by tacking on they don t call this the silly season for nothing brewer seems to be apologizing for her own broadcast _meta_end_dot_

 that s a cop out and a weak one at that _meta_end_dot_

 if the story is foolish why is msnbc airing it _meta_end_question_
