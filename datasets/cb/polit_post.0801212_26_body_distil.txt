  guest post by morbo drivers on the new jersey turnpike are about to see something other than cement and _meta_number_ref_ wheelers _meta_end_dot_

 a large billboard has been erected on the southbound lanes between the george washington bridge and the lincoln tunnel that reads don t believe in god _meta_end_question_

 you are not alone the billboard is the project of a group called freethoughtaction _meta_end_dot_

 i was pretty surprised when i read about this _meta_end_dot_

 it s not surprising that a group would seek to erect a billboard like this what s surprising is that they found a company willing to rent them the space _meta_end_dot_

 books by prominent atheists like richard dawkins and christopher hitchens have sold surprisingly well _meta_end_dot_

 but as i ve mentioned in previous posts atheism remains the last taboo and there are some people in this country who just can t deal with it _meta_end_dot_

 billboard companies tend to shy away from anything that s likely to get the conservative masses riled up and stick to wholesome advertising like for cigarettes liquor lottery tickets and stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i never ceased to be amazed at the lengths some people will go to snuff out the threatening message of non belief _meta_end_dot_

 in chester county pa a woman named margaret downey who runs a group for non believers sought and got permission to erect a tree of knowledge on the courthouse lawn last month _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ foot evergreen tree was decorated with covers of books promoting skepticism of religion and concepts like evolution and church state separation _meta_end_dot_

 it shared space with a creche sponsored by the pennsylvania pastors network and a menorah erected by chabad of chester county _meta_end_dot_

 these were not government backed displays _meta_end_dot_

 they were privately funded and maintained _meta_end_dot_

 everybody is playing by the same rules everybody has access and everything s cool right _meta_end_question_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 reported downey noted that not long after the tree was erected one of the spotlights was broken and the other five lights had been turned away from our tree to focus on the cr che two books covers were torn off the tree charles darwin s the origin of species and dawkins the ancestor s tale a pilgrimage to the dawn of evolution _meta_end_dot_

 a few days later six spotlights on the tree were unplugged and someone tampered with the cables supporting the tree _meta_end_dot_

 not long after that more lights were removed and another book cover was ripped down _meta_end_dot_

 on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ downey said someone had taken a knife or bolt cutters and actually severed the lighting cords to where all the lights had to be replaced last month the catholic league for religious and civil rights complained about nativity scenes being vandalized _meta_end_dot_

 yes that s bad _meta_end_dot_

 people who engage in such behaviors are boorish hoodlums who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for anyone caught vandalizing non religious displays as well _meta_end_dot_

 an open forum is exactly that open _meta_end_dot_

 everyone gets to use it _meta_end_dot_

 this includes messages some people may not like _meta_end_dot_

 these messages are erected with private funds _meta_end_dot_

 no one is compelled to support them _meta_end_dot_

 we should all have the right to speak our mind about religion or non religion on public space without government endorsement of any message _meta_end_dot_

 it s a nice idea but it s not going to work until some people take an additional important step grow up _meta_end_dot_
