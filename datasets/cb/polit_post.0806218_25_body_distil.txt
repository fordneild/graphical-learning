  it s literally hard to believe that the washington post published a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word opinion piece about women being dumb _meta_end_dot_

 this is after all the _meta_number_ref_st century and reasonable sensible people like to believe feminism has made at least some strides towards equality between the genders _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there it is in black and white _meta_end_dot_

 charlotte allen without a hint of irony or parodist tendencies makes the case that women are dumb shallow and generally kind of pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 as proof allen kicks off her discussion by pointing to women supporting barack obama s campaign some with great enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 she goes on at great length to answer that question in the affirmative _meta_end_dot_

 indeed allen insists that women are embarrassing accurately described as the dumbest thing published in an american newspaper in many moons is a lengthy treatise that hopes to convince the reader that adult american women are generally worthless _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to swooning over obama allen went on to insist that the proof of women s flaws is evident in their tastes what is it about us women _meta_end_question_

 why do we always fall for the hysterical the superficial and the gooily sentimental yes according to allen women who like oprah celine dion romance novels and grey s anatomy are helping to prove the entire gender s flaws as human beings _meta_end_dot_

 apparently hoping to drive sensible readers completely over the edge allen again in all seriousness argued that supposed misogynist myths about female inferiority have been proven true including the notion that women are bad drivers have physically smaller brains and are awful at math _meta_end_dot_

 in one especially jaw dropping sentence allen writes i can t add _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ well i can but then what _meta_end_dot_

 i don t even know how many pairs of shoes i own allen concludes how the washington post editors decided this was worthy of publication is a total mystery _meta_end_dot_
