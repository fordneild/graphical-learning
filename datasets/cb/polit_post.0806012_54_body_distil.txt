  it s as if bill o reilly has never even heard of godwin s law _meta_end_dot_

 so let s review _meta_end_dot_

 someone not arianna huffington made intemperate remarks about nancy reagan in a comments section _meta_end_dot_

 someone on the huffington staff removed the comments _meta_end_dot_

 in response o reilly who s had some intemperate comments in his own online forum not to mention what he says on the air feels justified in comparing huffington to the kkk and insisting that there s no difference between her and the nazis _meta_end_dot_

 there has to be some kind of medication available for this guy _meta_end_dot_

 does that the nazi kkk comparison seems to have become something of a default criticism for o reilly _meta_end_dot_

 someone bothers him _meta_end_question_

 bingo the object of his ire immediately reminds him of the nazis and the kkk _meta_end_dot_

 that obviously includes dailykos not to mention michael moore al franken and hollywood libs _meta_end_dot_

 if ever there was a clown in need of some new material it s o reilly _meta_end_dot_
