  yesterday i suggested it would be great if the media highlighted the dnc s new _meta_number_ref_ years ad against john mccain and the rnc s baseless whining and threats about the ad _meta_end_dot_

 the more publicity this gets the better _meta_end_dot_

 this national ap article however is not what i had in mind _meta_end_dot_

 the ad falsely suggests john mccain wants a _meta_number_ref_ year war in iraq _meta_end_question_

 no it doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the dnc was extremely careful about the wording of the ad precisely because it didn t want to see plainly misleading articles like this one based on republican spin _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall put it in a case like this the ap has three choices _meta_end_dot_

 first and most preferably it would report on the rnc s complaint and then explain to readers what s true and why _meta_end_dot_

 second is the he said she said approach in which the ap article would simply note the rnc s attack without fact checking _meta_end_dot_

 and third is to accept the rnc s bogus attack as fact and report a lie as if it were true _meta_end_dot_

 the ap for reasons that defy understanding went with door _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 as a practical matter democrats may have an electoral edge this year but they re at a decided disadvantage in that they have to run three campaigns at the same time one in support of the democratic nominee another in opposition to mccain and another still in opposition to media outlets that seem a little too anxious to help elevate mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell howard dean and the dnc aren t willing to give an inch on this _meta_end_dot_

 dean has practically dared the rnc to file a lawsuit and the party isn t about to back down _meta_end_dot_

 but now dems also have to worry about ap articles going to every newspaper in the country stating incorrectly that the ad falsely suggests john mccain wants a _meta_number_ref_ year war in iraq once again here s the ad
