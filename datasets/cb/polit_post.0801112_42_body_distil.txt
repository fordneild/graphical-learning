  the president s abysmal poll numbers aren t worth noting anymore there s just no point _meta_end_dot_

 he s extraordinarily unpopular he s reviled around the world and his would be republican successors are embarrassed to say his name in public _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly worth mentioning anymore _meta_end_dot_

 but u s _meta_end_dot_

 news noted this week however that the white house is eyeing a bush comeback _meta_end_dot_

 legacy year _meta_end_question_

 it seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 he s the lamest of lame ducks rock bottom public support democratic congress and the absence of a policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 i was especially amused by the notion that the white house is anxious to work with his gop congressional allies on continuing his tax cuts they do know the dems are in the majority in both chambers don t they _meta_end_question_

 as for the notion of a remarkable poll shift to _meta_percent_ref_ i suppose anything s possible but this seems like wishful thinking gone horribly awry _meta_end_dot_

 posted a chart showing the stability of bush s disapproval _meta_end_dot_

 he s been in the low _meta_number_ref_s for over a year and it s hard to imagine where this remarkable bump is going to come from especially given the fact that most americans are ready to shift their attention to electing the next president and putting this painful chapter in our history behind us _meta_end_dot_

 second let s say the white house s optimism is not ridiculous and that bush really can work his way back up to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at that point he ll be the eighth least popular president of the last four decades instead of the ninth _meta_end_dot_
