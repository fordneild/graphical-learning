  this morning i d made a bunch of notes for a post about whether the delegate free democratic primary in florida was of any real consequence _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign not surprisingly was aggressively making its case that it did the obama campaign argued the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 my conclusion was going to be that it mattered if the media said it mattered what clinton hoped to gain was a boost in momentum driven by a perception of success _meta_end_dot_

 if americans saw a lot of footage today of clinton surrounded by cheering floridians with reports about her big victory then the results from florida would matter possibly quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 if not it was largely inconsequential _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense john edwards announced departure initial media reports started around _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 was awful news for the clinton communications team _meta_end_dot_

 all of a sudden the results from florida and the discussion of their significance vanished _meta_end_dot_

 the withdrawal of a top tier candidate vs _meta_end_dot_

 a primary with no delegates _meta_end_question_

 it was no contest _meta_end_dot_

 i m not suggesting the edwards campaign intentionally sought to step on clinton s win in florida just that the timing didn t help the clinton campaign s case we talked earlier about some of the big picture significance of edwards announcement but let s go a little further with some of the details _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic convention watch blog for example tackles what happens to the delegates edwards already won _meta_end_dot_

 and what about edwards voters _meta_end_question_

 in florida for example _meta_percent_ref_ of edwards backers said they would be satisfied with clinton as the nominee and _meta_percent_ref_ said they would be very satisfied similarly _meta_percent_ref_ said they would be satisfied with obama as the nominee and _meta_percent_ref_ said they would be very satisfied looking outside florida john judis finds other states exit polls offer a mixed message dems who backed edwards in iowa and south carolina show a slight tilt towards clinton but that wasn t the case in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 either way both obama and clinton wasted no time this morning praising edwards and reaching out to his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 edwards apparently called his rivals last night telling them that he was considering dropping out and asking if they would be willing to pledge to make poverty a top issue of their campaigns and presidencies _meta_end_dot_

 both clinton and obama not surprisingly agreed _meta_end_dot_

 moreover obama was first out of the gate with an effusive statement noting that edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling even when it wasn t popular to do or covered in the news given edwards frustration with his lack of media coverage the statement showed that the obama campaign was sensitive to the former senator s concerns _meta_end_dot_

 clinton quickly followed suit with praise of her own and one upped obama by saluting edwards on her campaign s homepage _meta_end_dot_

 as for endorsement talk it s the one question everyone s curious about but which we won t be able to answer right away _meta_end_dot_

 an edwards campaign aide said the former senator won t make any endorsement for the moment but wouldn t rule out the possibility of an endorsement before feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 plenty more to come i m sure _meta_end_dot_
