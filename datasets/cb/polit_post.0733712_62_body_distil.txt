  in a recent issue of national review ramesh ponnuru and rich lowry explained how republicans can avert electoral disaster and get back on track _meta_end_dot_

 conservative writers offer advice columns like these periodically but this one included a concession we usually don t see in print _meta_end_dot_

 this apparently is the principal fear _meta_end_dot_

 not just that democrats will win but also that they ll implement a policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not just that the agenda is liberal it s that the agenda will discourage americans from embracing a conservative agenda in the future _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman responding to the ponnuru lowry piece noted this isn t an entirely new point but it s worth rehashing once in a while the right will resist universal healthcare with all its might because as a matter of electoral strategy conservatives don t have a choice _meta_end_dot_

 distributed a memo to congressional republicans exactly _meta_number_ref_ years ago yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t about the quality of the policy necessarily it was about political survival _meta_end_dot_

 if dems could deliver on a universal national healthcare system dems would be positioned to win over a generation of voters _meta_end_dot_

 killing the bill undermined the needs of millions but it also meant blocking dems from a historic victory _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the republican party and its allied hacks like kristol were concerned the choice was obvious _meta_end_dot_

 and it still is _meta_end_dot_

 if a democratic president and a democratic congress can finish what bill clinton started in _meta_number_ref_ ponnuru and lowry said americans will be discouraged from embracing a conservative agenda in the future if that means tens of millions of americans without access to healthcare so be it _meta_end_dot_

 we saw a helpful reminder of this during the s chip debate over the summer _meta_end_dot_

 as brian beutler added the fear for conservatives is that it ll work so well that people will begin to realize that it might be worth paying for broader reforms with broader taxes and so would blossom a vastly improved health care system in this country at the expense of a few very powerful interests and we really can t have that _meta_end_dot_
