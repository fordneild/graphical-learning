  john mccain for several years now has told everyone who will listen that his record is one of mainstream conservative as a presidential candidate he offers voters a clearly conservative approach to governing and yet reporters at major news outlets don t believe him and feel the need to tell the public that mccain isn t especially conservative at all _meta_end_dot_

 just this week the boston globe reported that the senator s opposition to bush on a range of issues combined with his nonideological voting record gives him an image of moderation an image of course that the media seems anxious to reinforce _meta_end_dot_

 consider another example _meta_end_dot_

 about a week ago in the midst of a discussion on jeremiah wright msnbc s joe scarborough insisted that mccain has never attached himself to these people on the far right that say if you re gay you re going to hell et cetera et cetera et cetera scarborough s observation was completely right just so long as one overlooks mccain attaching himself to radical televangelists like john hagee rod parsely and the late jerry falwell _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this not just because it s maddening but because it s a subject covered very well in a new book free ride john mccain and the media written by media matters david brock and paul waldman _meta_end_dot_

 as part of the release of the book some blogging colleagues and i are featuring various myths tackled by the authors _meta_end_dot_

 atrios covered myth _meta_number_ref_ the other day john mccain is a maverick today i m highlighting myth _meta_number_ref_ john mccain is a moderate desperate need of debunking _meta_end_dot_

 some of this came before his metamorphosis into the consistently conservative candidate we see today some of it during _meta_end_dot_

 either way to characterize mccain as some kind of moderate is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 free ride covers this and other myths extremely well and i can t recommend the book highly enough _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s relationship with the media or as it s better known mccain s base is going to be one of the most important angles to the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 brock and waldman know this issue better than anyone and their book deserves to be read by reporters staffers and voters _meta_end_dot_
