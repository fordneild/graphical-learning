  in general there are two ways to challenge john mccain s credibility on military and national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 the first is to concede that mccain has a fairly lengthy background in these issues but that experience is ultimately of little value because he s fundamentally wrong about the major challenges the u s _meta_end_dot_

 faces in today s world _meta_end_dot_

 we can honor mccain s service the argument goes but as president he would use his experience to give us more of what we ve seen from bush cheney and that would be a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 the second is to argue that mccain doesn t really have the background he needs in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 on a clinton campaign conference call yesterday wesley clark byron york reported said mccain s military experience is of little strategic value several decades later _meta_end_dot_

 clark a retired four star general and former commander of nato said according to york after clark s comments retired admiral william owens former vice chairman of the joint chief of staff added i would just say that i agree with wes on that as one might imagine this isn t going over well among some conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 my question isn t so much over whether clark was right in his analysis of mccain s experience but rather whether it s the most politically salient way to go on the offensive against him _meta_end_dot_

 took on clark s analysis _meta_end_dot_

 now i d argue that joyner is probably selling hillary clinton s background short but his broader point is nevertheless fairly compelling _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s military heroics came _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 how relevant is that experience now in offering a foreign policy vision for the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_question_

 not much _meta_end_dot_

 that i suspect is the point clark was trying to hammer home _meta_end_dot_

 and on the facts clark certainly isn t wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the problem though is that it s unhelpful for democrats in general to make this debate about who has the longest and most impressive background in military matters in large part because our candidates looking at a tale of the tape are going to come up short for the very reasons joyner mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 it s far preferable it seems to me to go back to point _meta_number_ref_ mccain for all his experience is still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he showed courage and strength in uniform decades ago and he s been a washington insider and sunday morning show favorite for a quarter century now but none of that changes the fact that on the world s biggest challenges mccain s ideas vision and solutions are the opposite of what america needs right now _meta_end_dot_

 clark s point is well taken but the message doesn t seem to fit the dynamic _meta_end_dot_
