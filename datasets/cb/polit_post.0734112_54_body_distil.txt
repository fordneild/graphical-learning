  last week at the debate for republican presidential candidates rep _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter r calif made the ridiculous claim that u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and their families are by their very nature conservative _meta_end_dot_

 m ost americans most kids who leave that that breakfast table and go and serve in the military and make that corporate decision with their family most of them are conservatives even on its face it was an absurd argument but the evidence to disprove hunter s claim keeps piling up _meta_end_dot_

 specifically nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of military families disapprove of the president s performance and his handling of the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 among those families with members serving in iraq or afghanistan six in _meta_number_ref_ say the war has not been worth the cost _meta_end_dot_

 in both instances the opinions of military families are in line with those of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 civilian population _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most importantly a clear majority _meta_percent_ref_ of these families favor a withdrawal within the coming year or right away i m of course looking forward to congressional republicans smearing these families as cut and runners and limbaugh blasting them for being phony military families this military times poll from a year ago _meta_end_question_

 moreover there s a partisan shift apparently underway _meta_end_dot_

 brandon friedman at vote vets noted today way back in the day many of us voted for george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 personally i cast that fateful vote for him in _meta_number_ref_ when i was _meta_number_ref_ years old and just over a month away from being commissioned as an army officer _meta_end_dot_

 i figured i was doing my duty _meta_end_dot_

 i thought that republicans supported the military _meta_end_dot_

 but i didn t make the same mistake in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after one deployment to afghanistan and another to iraq i d finally learned my lesson it s a sentiment that s catching on _meta_end_dot_

 let s not brush past that too quickly _meta_end_dot_

 despite the perceived connection between the military and the gop and arguments that the troops and their families are necessarily conservative military families prefer democrats to republicans on issues relating to their needs _meta_end_dot_

 it s a welcome change _meta_end_dot_
