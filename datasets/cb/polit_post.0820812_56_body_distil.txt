  years ago i was having a conversation with a jazz pianist who told me when i hit a wrong note i keep hitting it so the audience will think it s intentional to move away from the wrong note would be a subtle admission of a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain seems to apply the same standard to himself _meta_end_dot_

 in late may john mccain announced his belief that u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq have drawn down to pre surge levels when pressed instead of simply acknowledging the error the mccain campaign insisted the senator was actually right just so long as we overlook the tense of the verb this week in another dramatic error mccain told katie couric that it s just a matter of history that bush s surge policy began the anbar awakening that of course is backwards _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of simply acknowledging the error and correcting the record mccain has decided to parse the meaning of the word surge yesterday mccain kept hitting the wrong note hoping that voters would think it s intentional _meta_end_dot_

 it s that strangled at birth phrase an odd way of mccain hedging his bets that stands out _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said the surge started in _meta_number_ref_ after the anbar awakening that began in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday mccain shifted gears and said the surge started in _meta_number_ref_ before the anbar awakening _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday mccain shifted gears again and said everyone except him is confused about what the surge is and defined it as a counterinsurgency strategy that was launched before the troop escalation and the anbar awakening _meta_end_dot_

 and on friday mccain shifted gears again and re embraced the original meaning of the word surge which he now believes was launched shortly after the birth of the anbar awakening _meta_end_dot_

 just for fun let s not lose sight of the fact that mccain held all four of these competing and contradictory positions over the course of a single week _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain is nevertheless basing his entire presidential campaign on his unrivaled expertise on and support for bush s iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the mccain campaign is premised on the hope that voters aren t paying any attention _meta_end_dot_
