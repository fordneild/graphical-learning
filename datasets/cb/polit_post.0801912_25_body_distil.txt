  following up on the last post barack obama made a comment the other day about the party of ideas that hillary clinton s campaign has characterized in a variety of imaginative ways _meta_end_dot_

 in a silly season of misleading attacks this one too is very disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 here s what obama said that sparked the latest campaign flap in the interview obama denounced some of the ideas he d referred to in the party of ideas remark but the clinton campaign pounced anyway _meta_end_dot_

 first came a clinton campaign conference call with reporters _meta_end_dot_

 then hillary clinton personally entered the fray _meta_end_dot_

 and then bill clinton repeated the talking points _meta_end_dot_

 actually he was _meta_end_dot_

 the point of course was that republicans were as obama put it challenging conventional wisdom of the time _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s republicans sought to remake the government _meta_end_dot_

 they saw dems establish a new deal system expanded in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s and the gop set out to undo what dems had done _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense republicans were very much the party of ideas dems wanted to preserve and expand the government system they d helped to create and republicans had all kinds of ideas about shaking up the system which meant of course a dramatic shift to the right _meta_end_dot_

 that s not an endorsement it s a recognition of recent political history _meta_end_dot_

 consider for example the rise of the right s intellectual infrastructure over the last couple of decades _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives created powerful think tanks to churn out research on their ideas to dramatically change the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 where were the progressive think tanks _meta_end_question_

 up until fairly recently they didn t really exist at least not at the right s level _meta_end_dot_

 i d argue that the party of ideas label effectively shifted in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush pushed to privatize social security the country balked and republicans quickly realized that they d run out of policy items on their wish list _meta_end_dot_

 they went through the motions voting on constitutional amendments to ban flag burning and discriminate against gays but these were the last gasps of a movement that had run aground _meta_end_dot_

 by the time of the _meta_number_ref_ midterms dems were offering a specific national policy agenda filled with new ideas that challenged the status quo and republicans were left to argue dems bad _meta_end_dot_

 taxes bad _meta_end_dot_

 gays bad _meta_end_dot_

 vote gop it was pathetic and republicans lost both chambers _meta_end_dot_

 the party isn t even close to recovering indeed the leading republican candidates aren t offering new ideas about anything _meta_end_dot_

 they are where the dems were in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s defending the status quo and hoping to build on what they ve created i e more tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 it s precisely why obama said the republican approach i think has played itself out the parties in this sense have switched places when it comes to visions and challenging the existing rules _meta_end_dot_

 dems were the party of the status quo and republicans were the party of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 now the opposite is true _meta_end_dot_

 i m not even sure why anyone would find this controversial _meta_end_dot_

 as markos put it yes the gop was the party of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 they were crappy ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but they were ideas that s not controversial so i m not sure why the clinton campaign is making such a big deal out of it i m not either but i have to admit i don t care for it _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate a point i raised the other day politics ain t beanbag _meta_end_dot_

 clinton obama and edwards are going to take rhetorical shots at one another and some of them are going to be cheaper than others _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 but it s still my hope that all of the dems can at least go negative based on actual controversies not manufactured ones that only work if one plays fast and loose with the truth _meta_end_dot_

 post script i also wanted to make one slightly unrelated point _meta_end_dot_

 none of this criticism should ever be interpreted as an endorsement or a denunciation of any one candidate or campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i ve defended clinton and criticized her _meta_end_dot_

 i ve done the same for all of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 my goal is to just call em like i see em and hope that the dems run smart aggressive reality based campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 when they fall short i ll say so but that s not indicative of playing favorites _meta_end_dot_
