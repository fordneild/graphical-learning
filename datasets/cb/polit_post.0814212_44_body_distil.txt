  in late march sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck hagel r neb the co chairman of john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign raised a few eyebrows when he said he hadn t endorsed mccain this year and didn t have any plans to do so _meta_end_dot_

 when i endorse someone or when i work for someone or commit to someone i want to be behind that person in every way i can hagel said _meta_end_dot_

 i ve obviously got some differences with john on the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 that s no secret _meta_end_dot_

 i want to understand a little more about foreign policy where he d want to go while conceding different visions of foreign policy though hagel added that his discomfort with mccain certainly doesn t put me in obama or clinton s camp that seemed like a pretty clear indication of hagel s state of mind _meta_end_dot_

 he s a conservative republican who agrees with mccain in general but rejects mccain s entire foreign policy worldview _meta_end_dot_

 that hardly makes him sympathetic to the campaign of a left leaning dem _meta_end_dot_

 but as the process has continued to unfold hagel seems to be moving further and further away from the republican whose campaign he co chaired eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 sam stein noted that hagel is quickly becoming barack obama s answer to joe lieberman much of hagel s remarks reportedly weaved between obama praise and mccain quips remember back in march hagel said he wanted to wait to endorse until he could be behind that person in every way i can given the circumstances which candidate mccain or obama do you think he d be more likely to endorse _meta_end_question_

 i trust that the obama campaign knows full well what it s doing but i d just add that now would likely be a very good time for some serious outreach to hagel _meta_end_dot_
