  after having first endorsed the decision to strip florida and michigan of its convention delegates the clinton campaign reversed course and insisted that the dnc s rules and bylaws committee seat the full delegations from both states even though voters in the states were told in advance that their votes wouldn t count and even though the candidates didn t campaign in either state _meta_end_dot_

 this morning the democratic party s lawyers explained that the rules and bylaws committee can t grant the clinton campaign s request the committee even if it wanted to simply doesn t have the authority _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to sarabeth for the heads up there is however an option to restore all of the states delegates _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not a very attractive one _meta_end_dot_

 in other words clinton could decide to take this matter to the credentials committee but that would mean dragging out this process until late august _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the clinton campaign could make its case to the credentials committee only to have committee members decide not to grant the request meaning that the process had been delayed for no reason _meta_end_dot_

 is clinton prepared to do that _meta_end_question_

 it s obviously difficult to speculate though clinton did suggest a week ago in an interview with the ap that she d at least consider taking her fight to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably worth noting just as an aside that if the party were for whatever reason to reverse course and accept the results of the michigan and florida primaries just as they are despite all the reasons not to clinton would still lose _meta_end_dot_

 the delegates she would gain still wouldn t be enough to overcome her existing deficit _meta_end_dot_

 so why bother _meta_end_question_

 because if the campaign can somehow get the non binding florida and michigan contests to count clinton may be in a position to claim that she won the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 that might not be enough to change superdelegates minds in the _meta_number_ref_th hour but it might be enough to undermine the legitimacy of an obama nomination and may very well feed the perception that the democratic nominee stole the nomination that clinton under this scenario rightfully earned _meta_end_dot_

 how this is supposed to help the democratic party win the white house in november is unclear _meta_end_dot_
