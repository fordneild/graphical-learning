  i have to admit watching the race for the democratic presidential nomination the past several days has been slightly less annoying _meta_end_dot_

 it s been far from perfect of course but hillary clinton and barack obama have been talking more about actual policy differences and less about nonsense take your pick flag pins wright ayers bitter etc and process electability polls etc _meta_end_dot_

 we ve certainly seen that with the debate over gas tax policy and over the weekend we saw it again with a debate over iran and deterrence _meta_end_dot_

 this began in earnest a couple of weeks ago with a question in abc s notorious debate when in response to a hypothetical question from george stephanopoulos clinton said i would make it clear to the iranians that an attack on israel would incur massive retaliation from the united states because massive retaliation is a truman era phrase relating to a nuclear strike clinton s remarks raised a few eyebrows _meta_end_dot_

 she expanded a bit on her remarks a week later adding in the next ten years during which iranians might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them observers weren t quite sure what to think when clinton s chief spokesperson said neither talk of total obliteration nor her talk about massive retaliation should be considered a threat to use nuclear weapons yesterday obama pushed back against the perceived saber rattling for her part clinton did not back down at all _meta_end_dot_

 clinton asked rhetorically why would i have any regrets obama added in terms of policy analysis mark kleiman makes the case that clinton s aggressive tone may inadvertently help mahmoud ahmadinejad _meta_end_dot_

 and in terms of political analysis greg sargent added a good point it s hard to say how voters might respond to all of this it s possible americans will like talk of obliterating iran _meta_end_dot_

 either way though it s nice to be able to explore substantive differences between the candidates in ways that have nothing to do with gaffes or guilt by association _meta_end_dot_
