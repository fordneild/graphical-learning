  barack obama sat down with the atlantic s jeffrey goldberg to discuss u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy towards israel and for the first _meta_percent_ref_ of the interview obama offered a solid uncontroversial position which included effusive praise for the jewish state _meta_end_dot_

 so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 obama then added w hat i think is that this constant wound that this constant sore does infect all of our foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the lack of a resolution to this problem provides an excuse for anti american militant jihadists to engage in inexcusable actions and so we have a national security interest in solving this and i also believe that israel has a security interest in solving this because i believe that the status quo is unsustainable _meta_end_dot_

 i am absolutely convinced of that i want to solve the problem describing the israeli palestinian conflict as a source of instability in the region and a dispute in need of a resolution hardly seems controversial _meta_end_dot_

 so house republican leaders changed obama s words to make him say what they wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 by any reasonable definition of the word they lied _meta_end_dot_

 and then cantor _meta_end_dot_

 pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 house gop leaders are well past the point of shame but if there s even a shred of decency among them boehner and cantor will say their statements were written by overeager staffers and apologize _meta_end_dot_

 boehner s reference to carter was an especially ridiculous move given that obama specifically denounced it in the very same interview i strongly reject carter s characterization _meta_end_dot_

 israel is a vibrant democracy the only one in the middle east and there s no doubt that israel and the palestinians have tough issues to work out to get to the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security but injecting a term like apartheid into the discussion doesn t advance that goal _meta_end_dot_

 it s emotionally loaded historically inaccurate and it s not what i believe jake tapper concluded actually they might _meta_end_dot_

 if clowns like boehner and cantor had any confidence at all in the merits of the republican agenda or the value of ideas they wouldn t perceive lies like these as necessary for electoral success _meta_end_dot_

 update the atlantic s goldberg who is a conservative also blasted boehner calling the minority leader s attack on obama mendacious duplicitous gross and comically refutable goldberg called on boehner to do the right thing and correct the record
