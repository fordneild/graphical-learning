  it s surprisingly easy to turn on the tv and find countless examples of why most coverage of the presidential campaign is utterly useless but greg sargent found a particularly egregious example yesterday on meet the press _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s show consisted of six media personalities discussing the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 it was hardly gripping television we the humble audience basically got to peek in on a discussion among six media insiders discussing the horserace _meta_end_dot_

 the discussion turned to rudy giuliani s bernie kerik problem and tim russert read the spin the former mayor told the ap there were mistakes made with bernie kerik _meta_end_dot_

 but what s the ultimate result for the people of new york city _meta_end_question_

 the ultimate result for the people of new york city was a _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in shootings a _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in crime a correction program that went from being one of the worst in the country to one that was on _meta_number_ref_ minutes as one of the best in the country _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction of violence in the jails here s the video and the transcript but we heard several minutes of chatter about whether giuliani s spin works whether the issue would go away as the primaries unfolded _meta_end_dot_

 ron brownstein concluded that the kerik story is a reminder that if giuliani gets the gop nomination we will begin to explore the new york record and debate it and discuss it in a way that we haven t so far the underlying point of the discussion went unsaid but it was obvious giuliani appointed a criminal to head the nypd but he got results _meta_end_dot_

 the real question therefore is whether the ends justify the means _meta_end_dot_

 but this is complete nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s excuses for kerik are factually wrong _meta_end_dot_

 not a single person on the meet the press panel even paused to let the audience know that the claim they were discussing is demonstrably false _meta_end_dot_

 as greg explained the point of the program wasn t to inform the audience the point of the show is to highlight horserace analysis from a variety of media personalities _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if we the unwashed masses are lucky to have the chance to see six media insiders chat about who s up or down this week so nbc puts it on the air for an hour _meta_end_dot_

 which leaves it to the blogs to do the work media personalities don t want to do anymore _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani claimed that kerik reduced shootings by _meta_percent_ref_ greg found that there are no statistics that measure the amorphous category of shootings but there is data that showed shooting victims in new york city fell by just _meta_percent_ref_ between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so giuliani was only off by a factor of ten _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani claimed that kerik reduced crime by _meta_percent_ref_ wrong again _meta_end_dot_

 greg explained according to fbi crime stats in _meta_number_ref_ there were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ police recorded crimes _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ there were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 comparing these is actually overly fair to kerik since he started half way into _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so here we see a drop of roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ percent hardly the _meta_number_ref_ percent rudy claimed giuliani said kerik s success in turning around nyc s correction program was touted on _meta_number_ref_ minutes actually _meta_number_ref_ minutes featured kerik s role overseeing one specific jail not the city s entire corrections program _meta_end_dot_

 matthew yglesias added the one thing russert might have been tempted to air _meta_end_dot_

 i actually think the media s coverage of presidential campaigns is getting worse _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ i foolishly thought this was impossible _meta_end_dot_
