  way back in august _meta_number_ref_ the day before connecticut s democratic senate primary between joe lieberman and ned lamont the lieberman campaign s website went down _meta_end_dot_

 it prompted something of a media frenzy and ugly accusations from lieberman about his political opponents being responsible for the attack lieberman s campaign manager told reporters if ned lamont has a backbone in his body he will call on these people to cease and desist the lamont campaign issued a categorical denial and denounced the incident offered to help the lieberman campaign gets its site back online and even invited lieberman to put his site on its servers _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless lieberman aides filed a complaint with the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney s office and other agencies regarding the alleged attack _meta_end_dot_

 what of the more obvious innocent explanation _meta_end_question_

 the ap noted at the time the lieberman campaign denied speculation among liberal web pundits that the centrist democrat s web site had simply crashed because it used a low budget web host unable to handle the volume good news the criminal investigation is over _meta_end_dot_

 what actually happened in august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 well it s a funny story you don t say _meta_end_dot_

 and why are we just learning about the result of the federal investigation now _meta_end_question_

 that s a funny story too _meta_end_dot_

 if the lieberman campaign screwed up its own site and the matter was dropped why was it necessary to keep the results of the investigation under wraps _meta_end_question_

 regardless all s well that ends well _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure lieberman will do the right thing acknowledge his own mistake express regret to the fbi for requesting an unnecessary and wasteful investigation and apologize to lamont supporters for the bogus accusations _meta_end_dot_

 we re waiting _meta_end_dot_
