  as soon as we learned about the cia hiding and destroying its torture tapes the list of people who d been misled about the videos existence was surprising long and included a federal court members of congress and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission which has been tasked with expansive investigate authority including subpoena power _meta_end_dot_

 almost immediately it was the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission s members that publicly criticized the cia s deception _meta_end_dot_

 co chairman lee hamilton said of the agency did they obstruct our inquiry _meta_end_question_

 the answer is clearly yes _meta_end_dot_

 whether that amounts to a crime others will have to judge the nyt moves the ball forward today noting that the commission requested information repeatedly about detainee interrogation but were blatantly misled _meta_end_dot_

 the cia for its part concedes that it had the torture tapes and would have been more than happy to share them if only the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission had specifically asked for them _meta_end_dot_

 even by bush administration standards this is comically unpersuasive _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum offers a tale of the tape yep it s that bad _meta_end_dot_

 and given the commission s authority it may very well be illegal _meta_end_dot_
