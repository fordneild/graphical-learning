  it s not exactly a secret that fred thompson s presidential campaign isn t going well _meta_end_dot_

 by some measures that s a surprise he s plenty conservative he s never flip flopped on key issues and he s not a member of a religious minority that the gop base finds offensive _meta_end_dot_

 simply as a matter of process of elimination this guy should be huge _meta_end_dot_

 there is of course a problem thompson apparently has no interest in actually running for president _meta_end_dot_

 there s no shortage of stories about thompson running a lackluster campaign that seems to include avoiding voters _meta_end_dot_

 here s a good example _meta_end_dot_

 here s another another and another _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the former senator is allergic to retail politics _meta_end_dot_

 given all of this thompson offered an unusual admission yesterday his heart s really not into all of this _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen quite a few reactions that thompson s candid remarks are a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 overly ambitious candidates consumed with political gain are somehow unseemly the theory goes so thompson is a breath of fresh air he wants to be president but he has no taste for the silly often demoralizing process _meta_end_dot_

 i m just not so sure this is a plus _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time isn t there something to be said for a candidate having a fire in the belly _meta_end_question_

 excessive ambition can be unbecoming but is there really something wrong with a leader stepping up and working hard to make his or her case to voters _meta_end_question_

 in other words shouldn t someone who wants to be president be prepared to run for president with a certain gusto _meta_end_question_

 given the current challenges the next president will face maybe some passion for moving the nation forward might not be such a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 michael crowley reporting from iowa before thompson s comments yesterday noted proclaiming i m not particularly interested in running for president a few days before the iowa caucuses probably won t help seal the deal _meta_end_dot_
