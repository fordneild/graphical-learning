  i will never ever understand what someone in john edwards position was thinking _meta_end_dot_

 according to the abc news report edwards met hunter at a new york city bar in _meta_number_ref_ after which his political action committee hired her despite her lack of experience to do filmmaking work for his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 soon after as the two traveled together edwards and hunter began their affair _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth elizabeth edwards apparently became aware of the relationship in _meta_number_ref_ and the affair went on while her cancer was in remission _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is extremely unpleasant and raises more than a few questions _meta_end_dot_

 second what if he d won the nomination _meta_end_question_

 third in the future this will only encourage media outlets to be more aggressive in looking into candidates personal lives which is really a shame _meta_end_dot_

 fourth i really don t want to hear mickey kaus brag about this but he did seem to take this tabloid story seriously from the start even when the evidence was nothing more than some back room whispering _meta_end_dot_

 a broken clock is apparently right twice a day fifth before republicans pounce on this with too much glee if in the wake of edwards confession presidential candidate adultery all of a sudden becomes an important campaign issue let s not forget that this is one subject john mccain and his supporters really don t want to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 and finally there s still some unresolved questions about edwards conduct _meta_end_dot_

 what an embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 update i neglected to mention edwards had been rumored to be eyeing a key role in a possible obama administration _meta_end_dot_

 given today s revelation it s probably safe to assume edwards career in government is over _meta_end_dot_
