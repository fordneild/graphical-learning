  in the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election republicans decided that changing one s position on a major policy issue is perhaps the single worst thing a presidential candidate could possibly do _meta_end_dot_

 on any given matter being against something before i was for it was tantamount to a kiss of electoral death _meta_end_dot_

 consistency the gop insisted was the be all end all of presidential qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 well if those are the rules republicans want to play by so be it _meta_end_dot_

 after all the four top candidates in the gop field have been frequently and shamelessly flip flopping all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani is practically unrecognizable compared to his mayoral tenure _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain now opposes legislation he co sponsored en route to a dramatic reinvention of himself _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney was practically a moderate dem up until a few minutes ago _meta_end_dot_

 and now that mike huckabee is a credible challenger for the republican nomination he s decided it s time to reverse himself on a few major issues too _meta_end_dot_

 on monday in miami fred thompson chided huckabee for changing his stance on cuba on a dime to appeal to a particular group of people right before an election to which huckabee seems to be saying yep the reversal pander is apparently working the florida house speaker endorsed huckabee based largely on huckabee s new views on cuba which are the opposite of huckabee s old views on cuba but to really appreciate huckabee _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ consider his new take on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 now huckabee has been tancredo ized _meta_end_dot_

 his new immigration policy vows to crack down on illegal immigration close the borders and deport all illegal immigrants within _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s not a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 one day he a second tier candidate with weak standing in the polls and the next day he s a credible challenger for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that huckabee isn t even subtle about any of this _meta_end_dot_

 indeed his new immigration policy is little more than an article national review s mark krikorian wrote a couple of years ago except now it has huckabee s name on it _meta_end_dot_

 in some instances the plagiarism is so direct the campaign didn t bother to change some of the wording from krikorian s article in the broader context we re looking at four main candidates who have to hope republican voters forget all about their previous policy positions _meta_end_dot_

 may the best flip flopper win _meta_end_dot_
