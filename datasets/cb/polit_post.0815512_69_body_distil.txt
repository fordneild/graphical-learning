  last week john mccain made one of his more embarrassing recent errors telling a wisconsin audience that u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in iraq have drawn down to pre surge levels that s clearly false _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his campaign compounded the problem by insisting he was right about troop levels reality notwithstanding and arguing that everyone was nitpicking by suggesting his comments about his signature issue should be accurate _meta_end_dot_

 his aides eventually tried to make this a semantics debate suggesting mccain would have been right if we disregard verb tense while mccain and his cohorts insisted that his obvious error wasn t an error at all the senator nevertheless changed his rhetoric yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that s the good news _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is mccain s still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus is gonna come back in july when our drawdown from the surge mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 three of the five brigades are already back _meta_end_dot_

 there s two more brigades that will coming back at the end of july _meta_end_dot_

 but we are drawing back down from the surge _meta_end_dot_

 and then in july he said that he wants to pause except we re not really drawing back down from the surge before the surge there were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now _meta_end_dot_

 in july there will be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a debate over verb tense at the end of the current drawdown we ll have more u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq than before the surge began _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may find that politically inconvenient but that doesn t make his claims any less false _meta_end_dot_

 and people are beginning to notice _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s confusion last week about deployment levels did not go by unnoticed _meta_end_dot_

 the philadelphia inquirer s dick polman cnn s jack cafferty washington post fact checker the atlantic s marc ambinder msnbc mccain may find it harder to skate by over the next five months _meta_end_dot_

 given the huge number of mistakes mccain has made about iraq lately he might want to take this time to get his act together _meta_end_dot_
