  the nyt noted today not since at least _meta_number_ref_ when the united states was reeling from the oil shocks inflation and slow growth of the previous decade has the economy been in worse shape heading into the heart of a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the crush of bad economic news six consecutive months of job losses rising rates of home foreclosures gasoline prices seemingly headed toward _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon is increasingly setting the contours of the race between senators barack obama and john mccain that sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 it s against this backdrop that both candidates are focusing almost exclusively this week on their economic agendas _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain that s daunting he s not only embraced the bush economic model as his own he s also repeatedly acknowledged that he doesn t know or understand economics as well as i should in a high profile speech in denver today mccain will help prove just how confused he really is and then take his incoherent show on the road hitting michigan ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 i sometimes get the sense someone dared john mccain to run for president while spouting nothing but nonsense just to see what he could get away with _meta_end_dot_

 today is just such an occasion _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t like that promise anymore and withdrew it _meta_end_dot_

 now he s changed his mind again and brought the promise back _meta_end_dot_

 second committing the savings from victory in the iraq and afghanistan to deficit reduction is a new one _meta_end_dot_

 before mccain said he could eliminate a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deficit with _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in earmark reductions _meta_end_dot_

 applying some kind of peace dividend is yet another way to justify the unjustifiable _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t complicated _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t claim savings from victory in iraq if he plans to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in the country for another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 he also can t claim savings from victory in these conflicts when we haven t actually won the wars unless mccain is now prepared to set a deadline which he s said he d never do _meta_end_dot_

 he also can t claim savings from victory in afghanistan when conditions on the ground there are getting worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 he also can t claim savings from victory when he wants to spend more money to expand the size of the military _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to imagine even gullible conservatives falling for such a transparently ridiculous pitch _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks he can make permanent bush s tax cuts and add some new tax cuts of his own and eliminate the amt and keep the wars going indefinitely and increase the pentagon s budget and eliminate a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deficit in four years _meta_end_dot_

 it s pure fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 meet john mccain the candidate who bases his policies on magic ponies and his rhetoric on the hopes that voters are idiots _meta_end_dot_
