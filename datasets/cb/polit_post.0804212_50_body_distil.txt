  by saturday night john mccain had already experienced a pretty rough day _meta_end_dot_

 he d been trounced by mike huckabee in the kansas caucuses and then learned he d been beaten handily in louisiana gop primary _meta_end_dot_

 in washington state which was supposed to be a far easier win for the arizona senator mccain was trailing huckabee for part of the night but with _meta_percent_ref_ of the precincts reporting mccain had a narrow lead which was less than two percentage points _meta_end_dot_

 that s when it got a little odd _meta_end_dot_

 election watchers kept an eye on the results waiting for additional precincts to report and wondering whether mccain s narrow lead would evaporate _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing was additional precincts didn t report _meta_end_dot_

 despite the narrow margin and with plenty of votes left to go the state republican party stopped counting and declared mccain the winner _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall noted yesterday josh certainly isn t the only one to find the events unusual _meta_end_dot_

 on meet the press yesterday huckabee argued that the washington state caucuses were still too close to call when russert responded well the party has declared it over huckabee said they have but there s some weird things so weird in fact that the huckabee campaign is sending in the lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 issued a statement insisting that it will be exploring all available legal options regarding the dubious final results for the state of washington state republican precinct caucuses it added that the campaign is deeply disturbed by the obvious irregularities and argued that the state gop disenfranchised more than one in eight republican voters in washington _meta_end_dot_

 asked for an explanation state republican party chairman luke esser said he just felt confident that the other _meta_percent_ref_ of the votes didn t need to be counted _meta_end_dot_

 he told reporters maybe it would have been safer if i hadn t said anything _meta_end_dot_

 but it was an exciting and historic day for the state and i thought if i was confident about what the outcome would be i should share that with the people who had gone out to their caucuses it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 according to a report in the seattle times this morning esser has vowed to get as close as we can to _meta_number_ref_ percent in the vote count _meta_end_dot_

 how reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 as for the best response to this flap i think a tpm reader nailed it nice to know the repubs have progressed from _meta_number_ref_ where they refused to count democratic votes to _meta_number_ref_ where they are now refusing to count their own votes it s a story ripe with possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 i ll keep you posted _meta_end_dot_
