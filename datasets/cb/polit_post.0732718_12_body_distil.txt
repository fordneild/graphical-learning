  when a presidential candidate misspeaks and commits a dreaded gaffe it s embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 when a candidate commits a gaffe that feeds into existing concerns it tends to have a far greater impact _meta_end_dot_

 so in _meta_number_ref_ when bill clinton said he didn t inhale it reinforced the narrative that he liked to try and have things both ways in this case he tried to try marijuana but couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 when john kerry accurately described his votes on an appropriations bill saying he voted for it before he voted against it it reinforced the largely bogus notion that he was inconsistent on his policy positions _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i wonder if rudy giuliani s comments to the weekly standard might help underscore what a ridiculous candidate he is _meta_end_dot_

 now by any reasonable measure giuliani sounds ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani could have said yes i was a liberal democrat in _meta_number_ref_ but soon after saw the error of my ways _meta_end_dot_

 like ronald reagan i made the transition from democrat to republican and i m glad i did that would have been a perfectly satisfactory answer and very few voters would lift an eyebrow over how a candidate voted in an election _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but giuliani chose a very different direction _meta_end_dot_

 he told the weekly standard that he voted for mcgovern but he really thought nixon was the better candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he knew nixon would keep the nation safer but he voted for mcgovern anyway _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani was in reflex mode whatever the hell that means _meta_end_dot_

 this is both amusing and pathetic at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent added an important contextual note quite right _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the war in vietnam was still a disaster and mcgovern ran on a platform that advocated withdrawal from the vietnam war in exchange for the return of american prisoners of war and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country giuliani heard this and supported mcgovern but wants the conservative weekly standard to know _meta_number_ref_ years later than he knew even then that he was supporting the candidate that was weak on national security _meta_end_dot_

 what possible motivation could giuliani have to make himself sound like a raving idiot _meta_end_question_

 it s about some absurd notion of consistency for whatever reason he doesn t want to say he made the transition from liberal to conservative he wants to be able to say he was conservative all along _meta_end_dot_

 as a result giuliani feels like has to say he voted for mcgovern but he knew at the time he was making the wrong choice _meta_end_dot_

 in effect he s saying in order to prove my conservative bona fides i m willing to admit that i intentionally voted for the weaker candidate during a war _meta_end_dot_

 see how consistent i am in recent months a growing number of americans have come to realize that giuliani has no real center and will say and do anything to get elected _meta_end_dot_

 it s exactly why this gaffe may be the worst of the campaign thus far _meta_end_dot_
