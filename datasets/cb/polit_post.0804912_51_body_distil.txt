  guest post by dna note hey everyone steve is sick and he asked me and a few other folks to fill in _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he ll be checking his email so feel free to show him a little love with a get well note _meta_end_dot_

 last year congress passed a law that was hailed as the first major gun control legislation in a decade in response to the virginia tech shootings _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation was supposed to close the loophole that allowed seung hui cho who had been ordered by a judge to undergo outpatient mental health treatment to buy a gun _meta_end_dot_

 the press slipped into a bipartisan rapture over the involvement of the nra in crafting the legislation but six days before last thursday s shooting stephen kazmierczak a former student at northern illinois university walked into a gun shop in champaign ill _meta_end_dot_

 and bought two guns he later used to kill six people and then himself in a rampage on niu s campus _meta_end_dot_

 kazmierczak like seung hui had a history of mental illness _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not kazmierczak wanted to identify with being mentally ill the issue seems to be that he didn t have to _meta_end_dot_

 illinois gun laws require prospective gun buyers to apply for a permit which is more than many states require _meta_end_dot_

 but when kazmierczak filled out his application form he simply answered no to the pertinent questions _meta_end_dot_

 hardly a thorough background check _meta_end_dot_

 even more frustrating is that both kazmierczak and seung hui bought equipment used in the shootings from companies owned by the same online dealer eric thompson _meta_end_dot_

 it s not clear whether or not kazmierczak found out about the websites from news surrounding the virginia tech shooting or whether it s simply a coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 i ll avoid the obvious pun that could be made here at thompson s expense _meta_end_dot_

 but could this possibly be a surprise _meta_end_question_

 how many different things can you do with a gun _meta_end_question_

 kazmierczak may not have been flagged under current gun control laws because private mental health records are not included in the federal database so unlike seung hui who had been ordered by a judge to undergo treatment because two female students had complained that he had stalked them and was therefore in the system kazmierczak s illness was not a matter of public record because he had not been ruled mentally ill by a judge _meta_end_dot_

 there seem to be at least two related problems with the existing laws that allowed kazmierczak to buy the guns he used at niu _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that illinois laws regarding gun permits apparently don t require applicants to undergo a thorough background check _meta_end_dot_

 the second is that the collaborative legislation that passed the house last year doesn t identify people with a history of mental illness who haven t drawn attention to themselves from the authorities _meta_end_dot_

 the issue is one of privacy _meta_end_dot_

 it seems impossible to respect an individual s right to keep their medical history to themselves and still have an effective database that can identify ill people who try to buy guns _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we give our medical history away when we apply to schools and sometimes even jobs so an argument can be made that such a history can be kept private as long as you re not trying to buy a deadly weapon that can be used to kill scores of people _meta_end_dot_

 is it a tremendous violation of a person s individual rights for prospective gun buyers to have to give their medical history before buying a gun as opposed to disclosure essentially being optional as it was in illinois _meta_end_question_

 it seems like there would be some way to identify people with a history of mental health beyond those who have been adjudicated ill while respecting people s right to privacy _meta_end_dot_

 chuck schumer held a press conference on saturday vowing to close the loopholes in existing gun laws _meta_end_dot_

 why do i get the feeling the nra might not be on board this time _meta_end_question_
