  for a blog to feature news content from an associated press article is about as common as the sunrise so it came as something of a surprise last week when the news agency went after a prominent liberal blog for what seemed like a minor excerpting issue _meta_end_dot_

 well of course it would _meta_end_dot_

 the ap is one of the most commonly linked to news outlets on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 if bloggers can t excerpt _meta_number_ref_ words from an article it s going to have an effect _meta_end_dot_

 it was encouraging that the ap realized that its aggressive posturing towards the drudge retort was in fact heavy handed the result according to the nyt is an effort on the part of the associated press to define clear standards as to how much of its articles and broadcasts bloggers and web sites can excerpt without infringing on the a p s copyright that s probably a good idea though i m not sure if the standards are going to be a step in the right direction or not _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the ap s kennedy still expects the drudge retort to remove the seven items _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense the ap regrets the tone of its demands but not the substance _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy responded by telling the times that the ap believes that in some cases the essence of an article can be encapsulated in very few words so what is it exactly that the ap plans to do _meta_end_question_

 it feels bad about the heavy handed letters but it expects the heavy handed demands to be met _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t want to sue bloggers but it will enforce its copyright protections _meta_end_dot_

 it wants ap content to be part of the online discussion but not if ap content can be encapsulated in a few words _meta_end_dot_

 the associated press is going to figure all of this out and establish a new policy _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how that turns out _meta_end_dot_
