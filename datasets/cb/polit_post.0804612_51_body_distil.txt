  a few months ago when rep _meta_end_dot_

 john lewis d ga endorsed hillary clinton it was a key development _meta_end_dot_

 lewis a democratic icon and civil right legend became clinton s highest profile african american supporter and sent a signal to the party about clinton s strong connection to the african american community _meta_end_dot_

 as i understand it lewis was a few months prior undecided on whether to support clinton or barack obama but cajoling from bill clinton reportedly pushed the georgia congressman into sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s camp _meta_end_dot_

 now it appears circumstances have pushed lewis in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 just to be clear lewis switch was in reference to his role as a super delegate and he hasn t officially switched his endorsement from clinton to obama _meta_end_dot_

 that said the nyt added that lewis said he could decide within days whether to formally endorse mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama time s mark halperin argued that clinton s chances of winning the democratic nomination in light of lewis announcement have been cut in half _meta_end_dot_

 that strikes me as a bit of an exaggeration but i think it s certainly fair to say this is a major development _meta_end_dot_

 moreover it leaves the clinton campaign s broader superdelegate strategy looking suspect _meta_end_dot_

 the principal reason to distrust the superdelegate counts we see in the media is that these are people who haven t actually voted yet _meta_end_dot_

 they can and will change their minds and are susceptible to prevailing political winds and shifts in momentum _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously too soon to say but lewis announcement may signal a break in the dam _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has suggested in recent days that the superdelegates would be their ace in the hole _meta_end_dot_

 that may no longer be the case _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall explained my hunch is this hurts clinton most because it seems to represent a tipping point _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure it may not be but that s certainly the perception that many democrats may have this morning _meta_end_dot_

 the post super tuesday period has been an awkward one for her campaign between a string of defeats and a significant staff shake up _meta_end_dot_

 but there was also a sense that if clinton could keep her team together and focus on some likely victories down the road this unpleasant streak could pass _meta_end_dot_

 lewis move in this sense signals that time may not be on clinton s side _meta_end_dot_
