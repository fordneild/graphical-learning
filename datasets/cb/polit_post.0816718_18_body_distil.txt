  for several weeks a variety of political observers most notably thinkprogress amanda terkel and matt corley have highlighted karl rove s connections to john mccain s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and for several weeks bush s former chief strategist the man the president affectionately calls turd blossom has been arguing that there really isn t a relationship _meta_end_dot_

 just a couple of weeks ago george stephanopoulos identified rove as an informal adviser to mccain before an abc news interview _meta_end_dot_

 rove denied it and when stephanopoulos suggested that rove offers the mccain camp advice and information rove would only concede to chit chat with the republican presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly there appears to be a little more to the relationship _meta_end_dot_

 peter stone writes in national journal this isn t necessarily a surprise but it s interesting for a few reasons _meta_end_dot_

 two there is the small matter of journalistic ethics _meta_end_dot_

 for reasons that defy logic rove has been hired to play the role of professional journalist for a variety of outlets including fox news the wall street journal and newsweek _meta_end_dot_

 no one seriously expects credible independent bias free reporting from rove but no serious news outlet should be comfortable paying someone to offer commentary and analysis on a presidential campaign while simultaneously advising one of the candidates in the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and three the national journal article also noted that rove when he s not pretending to be a journalist and or advising the mccain campaign is also consulting with far right campaign outfits _meta_end_dot_

 it s noteworthy because national journal also recently reported that rove is up to his eyeballs in trying to nurture new independent political groups to help mccain and other republicans on election day _meta_end_dot_

 it s illegal of course for independent groups to coordinate with campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting then that freedom s watch and the mccain campaign just happen to be getting advice from the same person _meta_end_dot_
