  in the first quarter of _meta_number_ref_ fox news after six years of cable news ratings dominance saw itself slip into second place behind cnn in the so called money demo viewers in their mid _meta_number_ref_s through mid _meta_number_ref_s who advertisers care about most _meta_end_dot_

 the shift came thanks to a series of competitive primary nights and debates among democratic candidates after the republican nomination had already been settled _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out in the second quarter as the democratic race quieted down and the general election campaigning began fox news reclaimed the lead but just barely _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt notes today that the back and forth these last few months masks a more ominous trend for fox news clearly the democratic race and the fact that the democratic candidates wouldn t debate on fox news had something to do with the shift _meta_end_dot_

 but as the nyt noted d isproportionate interest in the democratic campaign alone cannot explain the struggles of fox relative to years past and the gains of its competitors maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but i d offer an alternative explanation as the conservative movement falls apart and the country is ready to move away from the bush republican status quo fox news schtick has grown pretty tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 time s james poniewozik argued recently that the network has to figure out how not to seem like yesterday s news there s something to be said for this _meta_end_dot_

 in bush s america with republicans in ascension fox news became the official network of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 officials were anxious to dish propaganda and the network was anxious to help disseminate it _meta_end_dot_

 the audience for gop talking points has however grown smaller as the party s failures became more overwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 given this it s no wonder cnn has practically caught up to fnc in the money demo and msnbc isn t too far behind _meta_end_dot_

 i d add though that the nation s good fortune may actually be fox news life preserver _meta_end_dot_

 if come january there s a democratic president and a democratic congress for the first time in _meta_number_ref_ years there are going to be plenty of suddenly motivated conservatives looking for a news outlet to tell them how awful the governing party is _meta_end_dot_

 fox news and its audience want someone to be mad at and come _meta_number_ref_ they ll probably have no shortage of options _meta_end_dot_
