  this week s revelations from the national intelligence estimate on iran have shaken policy circles around the world dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 it s had a sweeping impact on politics diplomacy foreign policy and national security and news about iran s nuclear weapons program shutting down in _meta_number_ref_ has been everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 and yet somehow mike huckabee hasn t the foggiest idea what it is _meta_end_dot_

 from an iowa event last night in october david brooks in an otherwise fawning column about the former governor conceded that his foreign policy thinking is thin that was obviously a dramatic understatement _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is running for president _meta_end_dot_

 a huge development regarding a key foe and nuclear weapons is front page news around the world and huckabee has no idea what just happened _meta_end_question_

 wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 let s be clear _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee not only has no idea what the nie said this week he also has no idea what the nie even is _meta_end_dot_

 he s running for president in a time of war but apparently understands the basics of the global landscape about as well as a child _meta_end_dot_

 how is this possible _meta_end_question_

 i don t agree with national review s byron york often but in this case his take on this was very much in line with mine _meta_end_dot_

 agreed _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has been effectively flying under the radar avoiding scrutiny because few perceived him as a credible candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t assembled a group of top notch policy advisors who could walk him through the basics such as how to read a newspaper because a he hasn t had any money b all the best policy experts had already signed on with top tier candidates and c he hasn t needed good advisors because no one has been asking him hard questions _meta_end_dot_

 and now huckabee finds himself in an untenable position he s a serious challenger for the republican nomination and his understanding about u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy is about as sophisticated as a house plant _meta_end_dot_

 he s yet another would be emperor with no clothes _meta_end_dot_
