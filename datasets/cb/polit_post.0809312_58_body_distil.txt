  dnc chairman howard dean recently argued that instead of waiting until the convention superdelegates should announce their candidate preferences by july _meta_number_ref_ which is well after every voter will have participated in every primary and caucus _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday dean s plan picked up some high profile support on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 for those who don t want to see the nominating race continue until late august this sounds vaguely encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 sure we d still have three full months of campaigning left but three is preferable to five _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter whichever way the superdelegates break having a nominee two months before the convention will give him or her time to vet potential running mates to put a ground game together to try to bring the party together etc _meta_end_dot_

 clinton supporters who accurately believe their candidate has the best shot at winning if the race goes to the convention are pushing back rejecting the idea of timeline altogether _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates should be afforded the same courtesy as regular delegates said rep _meta_end_dot_

 shelley berkley d nev a clinton supporter _meta_end_dot_

 they shouldn t have to make up their mind according to the timetable of howard dean and therein lies the problem with the july _meta_number_ref_ deadline everyone can ignore it without consequence _meta_end_dot_

 what happened when dean first raised the deadline subject _meta_end_dot_

 what can dean or reid or anyone else do to compel the superdelegates to endorse a candidate by july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 as far as i can tell nothing _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense dean isn t setting a deadline so much as he s making a request _meta_end_dot_

 but it s easily ignored and there s nothing to stop hundreds of superdelegates especially clinton backers who see the benefit of waiting until denver from simply ignoring the deadline altogether _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if dean can punish them for their obstinacy the rules say superdelegates vote at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the july _meta_number_ref_ deadline is interesting and i m glad it s drawing support from leaders like harry reid but it s probably best not to assume that the matter will be resolved by then _meta_end_dot_
