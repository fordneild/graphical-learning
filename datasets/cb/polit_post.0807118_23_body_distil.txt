  the brookings institute s michael o hanlon a high profile supporter of the war in iraq has his op eds published in major newspapers more than any human being should _meta_end_dot_

 ilan goldenberg noted that o hanlon has recently made his case for staying the course four times in the nyt three times in the wapo three times in usat and twice in the wsj _meta_end_dot_

 that would be _meta_number_ref_ pieces in four of the most influential op ed pages in the country over the past _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 basically once every two weeks goldenberg noted _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind it s difficult to keep up with o hanlon s unpersuasive arguments but his usa today piece in this morning s edition is especially frustrating _meta_end_dot_

 here s his explanation for example of what critics of the administration s policy can do right now _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon s argument in a nutshell is that dems should argue that u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops will leave iraq unless iraqis make more progress say by meeting a series of benchmarks _meta_end_dot_

 but that s what dems started arguing two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the right went berserk and the political progress never came _meta_end_dot_

 so what is o hanlon talking about now _meta_end_question_

 kevin added that o hanlon should be more specific _meta_end_dot_

 so do i _meta_end_dot_

 it s also worth noting that o hanlon needlessly threw in this misguided praise of the republican presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 vindicated _meta_end_question_

 mccain insisted over a year ago that if we only gave the surge a chance we d see major political progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 none of that has actually happened and mccain s predictions have proven to be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely that o hanlon given that he made the exact same predictions as mccain wants to characterize himself as having been vindicated tp added that o hanlon doesn t bother to explain how mccain s support for the surge been vindicated if the surge hasn t achieved its stated goal of political reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 nor does o hanlon explain what is admirable about a strategy that has exacerbated political divisions and prepared the ground for even greater sectarian violence i m sure he ll tackle these questions in his next major daily op ed _meta_end_dot_

 we shouldn t have to wait more than two weeks or so _meta_end_dot_
