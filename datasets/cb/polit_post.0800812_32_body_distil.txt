  it s fair to say that most neutral observers looking at the state of the democratic race objectively would agree that barack obama has become the front runner for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly a done deal but given the circumstances the smart money is on the senator from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 that said i think the talk about a clinton withdrawal is premature and at this point kind of silly _meta_end_dot_

 this report was on the front page of the wall street journal today _meta_end_dot_

 well yes that s true _meta_end_dot_

 inevitability now looks pretty ridiculous and counting on new hampshire as a firewall was a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 she s stumbled in iowa is likely to lose in new hampshire and according to the wsj report the campaign is considering effectively ceding south carolina no candidate in either party has won the first three big contests and gone on to lose the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it would be clearly an incredibly difficult task for clinton to overcome this kind of deficit _meta_end_dot_

 but i still think talk of her departure is hasty _meta_end_dot_

 some indicators to keep an eye on money clinton has amassed quite a war chest _meta_end_dot_

 as long as she has resources she ll be competitive _meta_end_dot_

 if she starts struggling with fundraising it s a sign to wrap things up _meta_end_dot_

 endorsements only _meta_number_ref_ of the senate s _meta_number_ref_ democrats have endorsed anyone _meta_end_dot_

 if the dam breaks and the senators start backing obama she ll face enormous pressure to take one for the team _meta_end_dot_

 until then she ll wait _meta_end_dot_

 most notably watch what al gore and john kerry do polls clinton is likely to largely skip south carolina because the proverbial writing is on the wall but if she has a chance of winning states like new york and california she has no incentive to end the contest _meta_end_dot_

 if the polls shift dramatically she won t want to embarrass herself _meta_end_dot_

 until then she ll wait _meta_end_dot_

 career prospects unlike john edwards who probably won t seek public office again clinton has a future and a day job to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 if a prolonged campaign featuring one defeat after another is likely to undermine her standing in the senate that would be a strong incentive to stand down but there s no evidence she s anywhere near that point _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent talked to one clinton advisor yesterday and learned that the campaign is worried about long term damage we ll see how that debate unfolds _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime it s hard to imagine clinton bowing out after just two contests no matter the margin _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
