  two weeks ago several bush administration agencies including the state department the department of homeland security and the national counter terrorism center released guidelines on how u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials should talk about terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 it s a mistake to describe islamic extremists as jihadists or mujahedeen the guidelines said just as it s wrong to condemn islamo fascism as the ap which obtained a copy of the documents reported such words may actually boost support for radicals among arab and muslim audiences by giving them a veneer of religious credibility or by causing offense to moderates nearly seven years after the attacks of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it seemed the administration was finally beginning to appreciate that words matter particularly when it comes to an international religio political dynamic like this one _meta_end_dot_

 the president had a little trouble with the stage direction four days after the ap report bush said at a press conference we re in a long struggle as i have told you many a time against these jihadists old habits die hard _meta_end_dot_

 chances are the president slipped forgetting what the counter terrorism experts advised _meta_end_dot_

 rick santorum however has heard the experts considered the significance of rhetoric and decided he wants to go on talking like he has been _meta_end_dot_

 via matt at tp little ricky sounds a little angry _meta_end_dot_

 and confused _meta_end_dot_

 condemn critics of his war policy arguing that some people believe muslims can t live in a democracy _meta_end_dot_

 he was going after dems but as it turns out he was actually describing far right allies like santorum _meta_end_dot_

 in his column santorum added this conflict like all great conflicts is not just a military struggle _meta_end_dot_

 it s an ideological struggle as well _meta_end_dot_

 it must be fought in the hearts and minds of people at home and abroad that of course is precisely the point of the bush administration s guidelines _meta_end_dot_

 it s unlikely to help when santorum suggests christianity is compatible with democracy and islam isn t _meta_end_dot_
