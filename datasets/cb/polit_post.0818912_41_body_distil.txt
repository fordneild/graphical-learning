  the only financial edge the republicans currently enjoy is with the national parties obama may be raising more money than mccain but the rnc has a flush bank account compared to the dnc _meta_end_dot_

 and the republican national committee began spending some of its money on this ad record gas prices a climate in crisis the narrator says _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain says solve it now with a balanced plan alternative energy conservation suspending the gas tax and more production here at home _meta_end_dot_

 he s pushing his own party to face climate change but barack obama the ad continues for conservation but he just says no to lower gas taxes _meta_end_dot_

 no to nuclear _meta_end_dot_

 no to more production _meta_end_dot_

 no new solutions _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama just the party line the rnc ad technically paid for by the newly formed independent expenditure arm of the party is on the air in michigan ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin and may end up elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 if the specific charges in the ad sound kind of familiar there s a good reason _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago the mccain campaign unveiled a web video calling obama dr _meta_end_dot_

 no for his opposition to coastal drilling a gas tax holiday and nuclear energy which coincidentally the rnc s ad repeats _meta_end_dot_

 of course the rnc s ad doesn t appear as foolish stylistically but it s still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc says mccain supports alternative energy in reality mccain opposed financial incentives to produce clean wind energy said no to subsidies for alternative fuels and voted against tax incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency _meta_end_dot_

 funny the rnc left these details out _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc says mccain supports suspending the gas tax holiday while obama would leave it in place _meta_end_dot_

 that s true but it neglects to note that even the mccain campaign concedes that it wouldn t lower the price of gas for consumers _meta_end_dot_

 the ad goes on to argue that obama opposes coastal drilling _meta_end_dot_

 that s true too but it neglects to mention that mccain agreed with obama as recently as may and that coastal drilling wouldn t affect prices at the pump until _meta_number_ref_ at the earliest _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc argues that obama has said no to nuclear but in our reality obama was actually the only candidate in the democratic field to suggest that expansion of nuclear power should be on the table as part of a broader discussion on energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 and as for the notion that obama offers no new solutions on energy policy that s clearly not the case _meta_end_dot_

 i d add though that the republican national committee deserves at least some credit for lying about something substantive instead of lying about something personal _meta_end_dot_

 four years ago the rnc sent out direct mail arguing among other things that liberals are trying to ban the bible _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense the rnc s shameless and pathetic style of campaigning now includes a higher class of deception _meta_end_dot_

 it s the soft bigotry of low expectations but i found the rnc s new message merely insulted our intelligence instead of being morally repugnant _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter wouldn t it be fun if the campaign actually included a real debate about energy policy _meta_end_question_

 it s unlikely since republicans know their ideas won t work and can t withstand even surface level scrutiny but it would be a delightful change of pace wouldn t it _meta_end_question_
