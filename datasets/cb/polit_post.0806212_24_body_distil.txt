  a couple of weeks ago when the clinton campaign circled march _meta_number_ref_ on its calendar the thinking was that texas and ohio would save hillary clinton they d serve as firewall states that prevented barack obama from ending this contest once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 big wins in these two states where polls showed her with sizable leads would deliver some much needed delegates to clinton s effort _meta_end_dot_

 with a couple of days to go that scenario seems far less likely but both of tuesday s key contests are almost certainly going to be the most competitive contests since super tuesday obama has won each of the _meta_number_ref_ subsequent contests by large double digit margins so who s going to win _meta_end_question_

 new mason dixon mcclatchy polls suggest it s anybody s guess _meta_end_dot_

 they re both close races said brad coker of mason dixon _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has a little better shot in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 she still has a little lead there _meta_end_dot_

 texas is a tossup other polls show the races shaping up in similar ways _meta_end_dot_

 its numbers this morning _meta_end_dot_

 and what about those other march _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_question_

 the ones thinking what about us it looks like clinton s best shot of a big win on tuesday is in rhode island where a new poll shows her leading _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and in my adopted home state of vermont it looks like obama should have an equally easy victory _meta_end_dot_

 polling is relatively scarce but a poll a few days ago from the local cbs affiliate showed obama leading clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
