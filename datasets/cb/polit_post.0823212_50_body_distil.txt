  following up on an item from the other day the rev _meta_end_dot_

 rick warren asked barack obama and john mccain the same two word question at saturday night s at saddleback church define rich after teasing rick warren a bit about his book sales obama explained that if he were elected those who make _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or less will see a tax cut under his administration and those making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more will see a modest increase as part of the broader effort to create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code mccain was also asked to define rich and he offered a rambling _meta_number_ref_ word response which among other things railed against a government take over of the healthcare system federal grants to study the dna of bears in montana the price of gas and the length of congress august recess _meta_end_dot_

 eventually mccain gave an answer so i think if you re just talking about income how about _meta_dollor_ref_ million he said it with a straight face but the audience laughed _meta_end_dot_

 i suggested sunday the response might come back to bite mccain on the butt yesterday obama seemed to be on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was on a panel the other day with me rick warren some of you may have seen it and rick warren asked him how do you define rich he said maybe he was joking he said _meta_dollor_ref_ million which i guess if you re making _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year you re middle class obama said _meta_end_dot_

 but that s reflected in his policies _meta_end_dot_

 for people who are making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million he s giving folks a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tax break the substance of this is what really matters _meta_end_dot_

 maybe mccain was kidding i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain is completely serious about tax policies that treat millionaires as some kind of at risk group in need of government assistance _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if he actually believes people who make _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year are middle class but mccain acts like he does _meta_end_dot_

 i d add that obama s comments yesterday appeared to be part of a sharper edge to obama s campaign since his return from vacation _meta_end_dot_

 reported that last paragraph comparing the economic records of the last two presidents was especially interesting given that it was nearly identical to the language paul krugman recently recommended obama use _meta_end_dot_

 i mention all of this in part because there s a growing impression in some circles that obama seems reluctant to mix it up _meta_end_dot_

 that s possible but i think it s just as likely obama is just getting warmed up _meta_end_dot_
