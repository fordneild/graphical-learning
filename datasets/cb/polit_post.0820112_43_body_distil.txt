  americans have a clear choice in the election _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand we have a candidate who wants a flexible _meta_number_ref_ month withdrawal policy from iraq shaped by conditions on the ground and in consultation with commanders on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand we have a candidate who wants the status quo to continue indefinitely waiting for a yet to be defined victory followed by an indefinite military presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and while americans consider their options it seems iraqi officials have already reached their own conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 reuters has this stunning story _meta_end_dot_

 by any reasonable measure this is pretty extraordinary _meta_end_dot_

 the bush backed iraqi prime minister has endorsed obama s withdrawal policy both in general and by name _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 maliki hailed by republicans has given up on republican talking points altogether _meta_end_dot_

 maliki added the americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them _meta_end_dot_

 but it isn t it s extraordinary _meta_end_dot_

 assuming the report is accurate and that there wasn t some kind of translation problem the prime minister of iraq believes john mccain is wrong about everything the utility of withdrawal the notion of defeat the extended stay everything _meta_end_dot_

 about a week ago maliki was publicly moving in this direction but now he s dropped the pretense _meta_end_dot_

 obama the prime minister believes has the right policy and mccain has the wrong one _meta_end_dot_

 i can t wait for a mccain to explain why maliki s opinion about events in his own country don t matter and b the media to explain to me why this is good news for mccain _meta_end_dot_
