  in the unlikely event you haven t seen it elsewhere right wing shock jock kevin james appeared on msnbc s hardball yesterday afternoon and chris matthews humiliated him _meta_end_dot_

 it was a bit like watch a car crash you really don t want to see the carnage and yet you find it hard to turn away _meta_end_dot_

 for all of his many many flaws chris matthews is not a complete fool _meta_end_dot_

 he s been around long enough to know when he has a dim witted clueless guest on his program and yesterday he felt compelled to say so _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that not all right wing voices are as dense and uninformed as kevin james he seems to be a uniquely embarrassing individual but in some ways matthews was highlighting the flaw in the cliched conservative talking points _meta_end_dot_

 any ol clown can pick up his talking points and go on national television to shout appeasement but if you just scratch the surface a little bit you see that there s nothing underneath _meta_end_dot_

 in james case the poor schmuck didn t even seem to know what appeasement means he just wanted to use it over and over again without being questioned _meta_end_dot_

 it s a lengthy clip but it s surprisingly easy to summarize _meta_end_dot_

 james compared obama to neville chamberlain because obama is prepared to talk to our enemies calling this appeasement matthews repeatedly asked james to explain what chamberlain did to appease hitler _meta_end_dot_

 the best james could come up with was he s an appeaser after telling this nut you don t know what you re talking about kevin matthews explained what chamberlain did wrong most people would say is not talking to hitler but giving him half of czechoslovakia in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s what he did wrong _meta_end_dot_

 not talking to somebody _meta_end_dot_

 appeasement is giving things away to the enemy it wasn t clear if james understood the history lesson _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it wasn t clear if he could understand any history lesson that didn t involve cartoons and monosyllabic words _meta_end_dot_

 wow obama had an advisor who is in confidence with hamas _meta_end_question_

 i had no idea _meta_end_dot_

 what a shocking revelation _meta_end_dot_

 except this is total nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 malley was part of the international crisis group icg whose purpose is to facilitate the negotiated conflict resolutions between international parties _meta_end_dot_

 bush pushed for the elections that empowered hamas and then malley and the icg met with the winner of the administration backed palestinian elections _meta_end_dot_

 of course malley talked to hamas _meta_end_dot_

 it was his job to talk to hamas _meta_end_dot_

 this does not mean of course that malley was in confidence with hamas either kevin james doesn t know what the icg is or doesn t know what in confidence means _meta_end_dot_

 given yesterday s performance on hardball i suppose it could be both _meta_end_dot_
