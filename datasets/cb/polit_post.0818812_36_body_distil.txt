  two years ago in the midst of a competitive senate race in maryland the national black republican association went to work in support of lt _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 michael s _meta_end_dot_

 steele a conservative black republican _meta_end_dot_

 as part of the group s efforts the nbra ran ads insisting that democrats were responsible for jim crow laws the kkk and releasing vicious dogs and fire hoses on black people _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr the group said was a republican and it was republicans who freed us from slavery and put our right to vote in the constitution voters were not fooled the african american community in maryland found the ads deeply offensive and steele was easily defeated _meta_end_dot_

 this year with the first african american presidential nominee on the ballot the national black republican association has an even more difficult task so it s pushing the old talking points even more aggressively _meta_end_dot_

 the nbra s message is unusually stupid and will almost certainly fail miserably but as long as the group is going to the trouble of making up ridiculous claims we might as well go the trouble of explaining why _meta_end_dot_

 two years ago steve klein a senior researcher with the atlanta based king center said that king never endorsed candidates from either party _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s highly inaccurate to say he was a republican because there s really no evidence klein said _meta_end_dot_

 a king biographer taylor branch also said thursday that king was nonpartisan _meta_end_dot_

 what s more given that the nbra s ads are not grounded in reality the king center asked the group to remove the billboards _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly the national black republican association declined _meta_end_dot_

 if they didn t care about the truth before pushing the bogus message it stands to reason that the group wouldn t care about the truth after the fact _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that in some ways this right wing group s message reveals more than it should _meta_end_dot_

 when republicans want to demonstrate to the african american community that the gop can be trusted it doesn t point to its agenda its values or its candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and why not _meta_end_question_

 because it wouldn t make any sense even putting aside the gop s humiliating record on civil rights and race relations today s republican party has very little to offer black voters _meta_end_dot_

 so we end up with stunts like these _meta_end_dot_

 it d be funny if it weren t so pathetic _meta_end_dot_
