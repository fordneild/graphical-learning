  when freedom s watch burst upon the political scene in august _meta_number_ref_ it was part of a coordinated effort to rally support for staying the course in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the group unveiled four slick tv ads including one featuring a veteran who lost a leg in iraq who argued that we have to stay in iraq because they attacked us it was part of a _meta_dollor_ref_ million dishonest blitz asking americans not to believe their lying eyes _meta_end_dot_

 of course the right wing group which aims to be a political powerhouse has always had far loftier goals _meta_end_dot_

 there was some talk of freedom s watch spending big bucks in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign cycle though a recent staff shake up raised questions about the limits of the group s impact _meta_end_dot_

 it now looks as though any hopes that these unhinged conservative hatchetmen would be weakened this year were wishful thinking _meta_end_dot_

 chris cillizza added forti called the position an important job in an important cycle asked about the goals for the organization forti said only his aim was to educate people about issues important to them and their neighbors yes educate carl forti is all about the educating _meta_end_dot_

 forti led in the _meta_number_ref_ election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 annenberg political fact check which is nonpartisan and scrutinizes campaign ads called the nrcc ads that forti oversaw the very definition of political mudslinging annenberg added that forti s nrcc work stood out for the sheer volume of assaults on the personal character of democratic house challengers and now forti is going to lead a massive right wing operation that intends to spend a quarter of a billion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 to put that in context there s simply no precedent for an independent political operation to have that kind of money _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ moveon org which was extremely active spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 the swift boat liars spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 harold ickes media fund spent in upwards of _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 freedom s watch aims to spend more than all of them put together and then some if the past is any indication freedom s watch s ads are going to be pretty vile american politics at its worst and most destructive _meta_end_dot_

 but i d just add one encouraging caveat forti went as ugly as he possibly could in _meta_number_ref_ and democrats crushed republicans nationwide anyway winning back majorities in both the house and senate _meta_end_dot_

 these efforts in other words may be caustic and injurious to our public discourse but sometimes they lose _meta_end_dot_
