  over the weekend hosting a town hall meeting in johnstown pa barack obama was asked about how his administration would address hiv aids and sexually transmitted diseases among young girls _meta_end_dot_

 obama s answer didn t strike me as especially controversial but the right seems pretty worked up about it _meta_end_dot_

 my radar must be a little off because i didn t see the conservative outrage coming _meta_end_dot_

 david brody a correspondent for crazed tv preacher pat robertson s show wrote punished with a baby _meta_end_question_

 that just doesn t sound right _meta_end_dot_

 why use the word punished _meta_end_question_

 i would think that word would be alarming to people and possibly offensive to those who have had babies out of wedlock brody wasn t alone _meta_end_dot_

 sean hannity pounced on this nbc s andrea mitchell ran a misleading report on the quote and far right bloggers were in predictably high dudgeon _meta_end_dot_

 one went so far as to argue i goess sic we could call these his terminating the family values now he s sic informed his chldren sic via the media that daddy will drive them to planned parenthood if they get knocked up _meta_end_dot_

 once again barack obama is making me question not just his ability to lead this nation but even his ability to be a marginally responsible father was the off the cuff comment really that controversial _meta_end_question_

 follow up statement to reporters who asked about the right s reaction to the remarks _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone seriously believe that obama thinks of parenthood as punishment _meta_end_question_

 and if not then what s the point of the conservative fuss _meta_end_question_

 that he s pro choice but committed to reducing the number of abortions _meta_end_question_

 i think we knew that _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes teenagers should be given as much accurate information as possible so they can make the right choices _meta_end_dot_

 if a teenage girl makes a mistake forcing her to accept an unwanted pregnancy is a punishment of sorts isn t it _meta_end_question_

 i m missing my far right talking points decoder ring but this just doesn t sound especially alarming to me _meta_end_dot_
