 bill richardson d has been one of the more sought after endorsements in democratic circles over the last month or so with aggressive lobbying from both the clinton and obama campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 it s not hard to figure out why richardson is a popular governor of a key swing state and arguably the highest profile latino politician in the country _meta_end_dot_

 after hemming and hawing for quite a while today richardson will back obama at a rally in portland oregon _meta_end_dot_

 this comes as a mild surprise given that richardson seemed to favor clinton when he was still a candidate no one came to her defense more during the debates and the fact that richardson joined bill clinton for a recent super bowl party interpreted in some circles as a hint of his intentions _meta_end_dot_

 indeed with the background in mind the clinton campaign will likely perceive today s endorsement as something of a betrayal _meta_end_dot_

 this exchange in january _meta_end_dot_

 as for the current campaign dynamics the ap noted richardson s endorsement also could help obama pick up support among hispanics who are the nation s largest and fastest growing minority that s likely true though there are fewer latino voters in the next few contests pennsylvania indiana oregon kentucky west virginia than the last few texas and ohio but given clinton s edge with this key constituency obama will welcome the help _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly though i suspect this might help shift the broader narrative a bit _meta_end_dot_

 the impression has been of late that obama due almost entirely to the jeremiah wright controversy has been on his heels playing defense _meta_end_dot_

 a high profile endorsement like this one gives the media something new and positive for obama to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 and of course richardson is a superdelegate making his endorsement all the more significant _meta_end_dot_

 with that attention now shifts to some of the other uncommitted heavyweights including john edwards and al gore _meta_end_dot_
