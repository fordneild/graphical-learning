 thad cochran of mississippi one of john mccain s conservative republican colleagues and a man who s worked with mccain for years raised serious doubts about mccain s temperament _meta_end_dot_

 the thought of him being president sends a cold chill down my spine cochran said _meta_end_dot_

 he is erratic _meta_end_dot_

 he is hotheaded _meta_end_dot_

 he loses his temper and he worries me the number of examples to bolster these concerns keeps going up _meta_end_dot_

 as newsweek noted this didn t amount to an international incident and the germans later said all was forgiven it was however just mccain being mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he s an equal opportunity hothead berating republicans democrats the powerful the powerless and anyone who annoys him in this country or any other _meta_end_dot_

 just the kind of guy we want leading the most powerful military on the planet during a time of war right _meta_end_question_

 hardly unique _meta_end_dot_

 and these examples of course are the tip of the iceberg and have even raised concerns among military officials about the senator s temperament _meta_end_dot_

 if the presidential campaign ever gets around to a one on one dynamic in which issues like these can be explored in some detail it s a personality trait that may get a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 we can hope _meta_end_dot_

 post script one other thing about the anecdote from germany notice that it was joe lieberman coming to mccain s rescue again _meta_end_dot_

 this seems surprisingly common doesn t it _meta_end_question_
