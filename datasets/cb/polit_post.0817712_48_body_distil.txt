  following up on an item from yesterday focus on the family s james dobson launched a fairly aggressive offensive against barack obama on the religious right leader s radio show accusing the senator of dragging biblical understanding through the gutter yesterday afternoon obama responded to the criticism _meta_end_dot_

 dobson was worked up in large part because obama in his _meta_number_ref_ speech criticized the notion of basing public policy on a literal interpretation of one religion s sacred text in dobson s case the christian bible _meta_end_dot_

 obama explained why this would be a mistake pointing to specific old testament passages including rules in leviticus on approving slavery and condemning the eating of stonefish _meta_end_dot_

 so before we get carried away let s read our bible now obama said in the speech _meta_end_dot_

 folks haven t been reading their bible dobson s response is that obama is deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the bible because old testament texts and dietary codes no longer apply to jesus teachings in the new testament _meta_end_dot_

 as a theological issue dobson s on thin ice _meta_end_dot_

 as a political issue dobson probably doesn t realize what a mistake he s made _meta_end_dot_

 traditional understanding sounds like some kind of liberal mamby pamby after the fact interpretation of the bible s plain text when dobson is supposed to be to borrow an expression a strict constructionist _meta_end_dot_

 indeed there s a bunch of great examples from the old testament _meta_end_dot_

 parents can stone a misbehaving child fathers can sell daughters into slavery garments made of two different kinds of threads are a real no no the list goes on and on _meta_end_dot_

 dobson on the one hand believes every word of the bible is literally true _meta_end_dot_

 dobson on the other hand also argues we shouldn t believe every word of the bible is literally true but should instead accept a traditional understanding of the bible _meta_end_dot_

 to do otherwise is to distort scripture _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately dobson apparently wants the focus to remain on the new testament _meta_end_dot_

 note to dr _meta_end_dot_

 jim christians are supposed to embrace both testaments _meta_end_dot_

 as for the politics dobson is inadvertently reinforcing obama s turn the page theme _meta_end_dot_

 the senator is talking about a new approach dobson wants an old approach _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes the religious right movement need not speak for people of faith dobson says the religious right movement has to speak for people of faith _meta_end_dot_

 obama sees religion as inclusive dobson sees it as exclusive _meta_end_dot_

 it creates the dynamic obama wants _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the ap noted that the rev _meta_end_dot_

 kirbyjon caldwell a methodist pastor from texas and longtime supporter of president bush who has endorsed obama said tuesday he belongs to a group of religious leaders who working independently of obama s campaign launched james dobson doesn t speak for me com _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think dobson thought this one through _meta_end_dot_
