  following up on the last post which talked about what barack obama s victory in iowa means i wanted to also take a moment or two to comment on what was a heckuva speech _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of substance a speech is just rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of campaign strategy an address thanking iowans for their support probably wasn t seen by too large a television audience _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve been a speechwriting junkie since i was a young kid and i watched obama s victory speech and kept saying to myself damn the funny thing to me about obama s recent rhetorical history is his ability to exceed absurdly high expectations _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ everyone expected him to give a great nominating address at the democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 in january _meta_number_ref_ everyone anticipated a good announcement speech _meta_end_dot_

 in november everyone thought he d bring down the house at iowa s jefferson jackson dinner _meta_end_dot_

 about a week ago everyone imagined his closing address would be persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 and last night everyone assumed he d say something inspiring to an iowa crowd that had worked tirelessly on his behalf _meta_end_dot_

 but in every instance obama capitalized on the pressure and delivered speeches that are even better than what the political world expects _meta_end_dot_

 last night was particularly impressive _meta_end_dot_

 summed up the reactions of many of us _meta_end_dot_

 remember that s from an obama skeptic _meta_end_dot_

 if you re reading this site chances are you re not a political neophyte with a passive disinterest in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 but for most americans the process began in earnest last night and obama s thank you speech may very well have been the first time a lot of people heard him speak _meta_end_dot_

 and if so it was quite an introduction _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure speeches won t win elections _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a start _meta_end_dot_
