  while in massachusetts mitt romney insisted that he did not want to return to reagan era policies and when confronted on his party affiliation he frequently reminded voters that he was an independent in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 but as a presidential candidate reagan became the focal point of romney s stump speech as he positioned himself as the heir to the former president s legacy _meta_end_dot_

 now with an eye towards the future romney has decided his presidential ambitions should be built around following reagan s example after his unsuccessful _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 via tp apparently quite a motley crew was on hand for the meeting _meta_end_dot_

 the acu s david keene disgraced activist ralph reed bay buchanan james bopp and laura ingraham among others were there to solidify the relationship _meta_end_dot_

 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it keene said to open the meeting _meta_end_dot_

 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us forget a year and a half ago i still can t believe it now _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ romney clearly believes his political career has a bright future but has to decide which persona he ll wear now _meta_end_dot_

 can do technocrat _meta_end_question_

 too dull _meta_end_dot_

 moderate who can win in blue states _meta_end_question_

 not in today s gop _meta_end_dot_

 right wing loon _meta_end_question_

 bingo _meta_end_dot_

 as far as romney is concerned if he had successfully wrapped up the far right early on last year he probably could have had enough support to beat back john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 so he s laying the groundwork to do just that for _meta_number_ref_ and the far right looking for someone to pay attention to them is apparently on board with the plan _meta_end_dot_

 it s the exact same strategy reagan embraced after _meta_number_ref_ when he became a national right wing leader before heading into the _meta_number_ref_ primaries _meta_end_dot_

 but let s just pause for a moment to consider who exactly the far right movement is rallying behind _meta_end_dot_

 he s the new face of conservatism _meta_end_question_

 they must be desperate _meta_end_dot_
