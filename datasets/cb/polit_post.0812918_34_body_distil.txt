  it s been a while since the republicans had a sex scandal _meta_end_dot_

 we had mark foley s page scandal in _meta_number_ref_ david vitter s prostitution problem and larry craig s bathroom incident in _meta_number_ref_ but it s been a little quiet lately _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the last few sex scandals have been dems gov _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer in new york state ag dann in ohio and mayor kilpatrick in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 it seems vito fossella is helping pick up the slack _meta_end_dot_

 fossella a republican congressman who represents staten island got into a little trouble last week in virginia where he was arrested for dui _meta_end_dot_

 he was caught with a blood alcohol level of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over twice the legal limit in the state _meta_end_dot_

 if convicted fossella would have to serve up to five days in jail _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule incarceration is generally a problem for members of congress seeking re election _meta_end_dot_

 the prospect of jail time would make it very hard for him to run again cook political report house analyst david wasserman said _meta_end_dot_

 the difference between serving jail time and pleading down to a lesser charge makes a huge difference in fossella s political future as it turns out that s the least of fossella s troubles _meta_end_dot_

 reporters in new york hinted in their stories that fossella might be the father of fay s toddler but even the implication drew an angry denunciation from the lawmaker s spokesperson who said the accusation did not even dignify a response _meta_end_dot_

 that is until this morning when fossella fessed up _meta_end_dot_

 roll call reported this afternoon perhaps now might be a good time to note that fossella has an _meta_percent_ref_ rating from the christian coalition for his pro family votes and supported a constitutional amendment to prevent gays from destroying the sanctity of marriage _meta_end_dot_

 fossella also voted to impeach bill clinton over an extra marital affair no word yet on whether republican leaders will call for fossella s resignation but it s probably safe to assume his political future is not bright _meta_end_dot_

 dems have been planning to target this district anyway and now the dccc has an added incentive _meta_end_dot_
