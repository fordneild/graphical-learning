  the bush administration not only has trouble following the law it also doesn t seem especially fond of enforcing the law either _meta_end_dot_

 through something called deferred prosecutions the administration is neglecting to prosecute corporate crimes that that would have resulted in indictments in previous administrations _meta_end_dot_

 of course companies are testing what they can legally get away with they know they have a justice department that doesn t mind taking a pass when confronted with evidence of corporate bribery fraud and other crimes _meta_end_dot_

 offered a chance at deferred prosecution agreements companies jump at the chance because as law professor vikramaditya khanna noted clearly it avoids a bigger headache for them the bush administration didn t invent this legal option but the new york times added that while deferred prosecution agreements were once rare they have skyrocketed in the current administration it s one thing to avoid regulating businesses it s another to make it easier for them to get away with alleged criminal activity _meta_end_dot_

 but as the nyt noted in an editorial today the cost to the public and the rule of law is too high remember back in the day when republicans presented themselves as the law and order party _meta_end_question_

 good times good times _meta_end_dot_
