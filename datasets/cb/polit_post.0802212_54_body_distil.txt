  one of the more persistent knocks against barack obama has less to do with his specific policy proposals which are pretty clearly progressive and more to do with his post partisan style _meta_end_dot_

 by emphasizing bringing people together obama according to his democratic critics too often sounds like he s using conservative frames right wing talking points and sending dog whistle signals to the right _meta_end_dot_

 of course nearly all of this is in the eye of the beholder _meta_end_dot_

 for obama fans he s appealing to independents and fed up republicans to expand the party and build a broader democratic coalition _meta_end_dot_

 for obama opponents the exact same appeals are part of some kind of triangulation strategy _meta_end_dot_

 worse his critics say dems are just supposed to take obama on faith he seems like he s using a moderate tone to advance a liberal agenda but what if he s actually moderate _meta_end_question_

 kevin touched on this yesterday it s a multi faceted question and i hesitate to over simplify matters but i think kevin s description is quite right _meta_end_dot_

 what s more given some of obama s comments in the debate last night i think the senator s sensitive to the question _meta_end_dot_

 these remarks from the event in south carolina now one can certainly argue that obama s strategy is flawed _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter one can say the strategy is sound but obama is the wrong candidate to execute it _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it s increasingly clear what obama is actually trying to do put a moderate face on a liberal platform in the hopes of expanding the democratic pie _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that can work maybe not but i think the suggestions that he s some kind of triangulating gingrich loving closet reaganite are misguided _meta_end_dot_
