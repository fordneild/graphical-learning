  abc news aired an interesting interview with dick cheney last night it was a pleasant surprise to see the vp willing to chat with a network other than fox news that covered quite a bit of ground relating to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there are quite a few oddities here _meta_end_dot_

 first the notion that bush carries the biggest burden is part of a series of arguments about how the poor president deserves sympathy for sending u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 last year for example laura bush said no one suffers more than the president when it comes to the war _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter cheney in response to a question about troop casualties said obviously the president bears the major part of the burden does the bush gang really think we should pity the president who arguably couldn t have handled this war any worse if he tried because his conscience is weighing on him _meta_end_question_

 maybe some would consider sympathy if they thought he needed it bush told a reporter not too long ago i must tell you i m sleeping a lot better than people would assume for the guy carrying the biggest burden the president seems surprisingly unperturbed _meta_end_dot_

 there was also this exchange from cheney s perspective you don t deal with that at all _meta_end_dot_

 withdrawal is out of the question a draw down is off the table and the webb amendment about giving troops more down time after their deployments has been rejected by republicans on both ends of pennsylvania avenue _meta_end_dot_

 so to hear the vp tell it there is no solution the administration s policy of multiple deployments will continue to take its toll on servicemen servicewomen and their families _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t like it tough _meta_end_dot_

 they shouldn t have volunteered to serve in the military in bush s america _meta_end_dot_

 remind me which side of the political divide is supposed to be more enthusiastically pro military _meta_end_question_
