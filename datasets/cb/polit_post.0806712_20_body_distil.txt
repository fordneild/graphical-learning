  house speaker nancy pelosi is the highest ranking roman catholic official in the federal government and not surprisingly she finds john hagee s anti catholic rhetoric offensive _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday to her credit she pressed john mccain on why he refuses to denounce hagee s bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 nico pitney has the story _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi apparently didn t realize that mccain had actively sought out hagee s support and when told about his on the conference call pelosi was surprised _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she certainly thinks that mccain should reject hagee s support and then added i can t imagine that he wouldn t reject it i can _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless comments on this issue from the speaker of the house raise the stakes _meta_end_dot_

 or at least they should _meta_end_dot_

 good point _meta_end_dot_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain actively seeks the support of an anti catholic anti gay anti muslim anti woman and anti semitic televangelist reporters don t think it s newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 when a prominent political figure criticizes mccain for seeking the support of an anti catholic anti gay anti muslim anti woman and anti semitic televangelist then it s a story _meta_end_dot_

 it s frustrating but that s largely the way the political media works _meta_end_dot_

 the question then becomes one of prominence is bill donohue from the catholic league a prominent political figure _meta_end_question_

 when he attacked john edwards last year the media seemed to think so covering his criticisms in great detail _meta_end_dot_

 now that he s attacking mccain however donohue s concerns no longer seem to matter _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 how about dnc chairman howard dean _meta_end_question_

 he went after mccain on this with a vengeance on national television no less _meta_end_dot_

 is he a prominent political figure _meta_end_question_

 apparently not the media didn t care _meta_end_dot_

 ok but now the speaker of the house has broached the subject _meta_end_dot_

 this has to give news outlets a news peg worth mentioning right _meta_end_question_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 according to nexis and google news not a single traditional news outlet noted pelosi s criticism _meta_end_dot_

 in my heart of hearts i don t really believe there s a coordinated effort on the part of reporters to intentionally bury this story and give mccain a pass _meta_end_dot_

 but c mon this is journalistic malpractice _meta_end_dot_
