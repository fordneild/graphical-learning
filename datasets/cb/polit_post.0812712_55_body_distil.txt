  i guess it s an instance of better late than never way back in february after an extensive outreach effort john mccain secured the endorsement of pastor john hagee a right wing megachurch televangelist best known for his bizarre anti catholic anti semitic anti woman anti muslim and anti gay views _meta_end_dot_

 mccain campaigned alongside his new buddy in advance of the texas republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 for weeks mccain s willingness to associate with and cozy up to hagee drew widespread disgust _meta_end_dot_

 despite condemnations from the speaker of the house the chairman of the dnc catholic groups on the left catholic groups on the right and jewish groups a month after the endorsement the combined number of articles about mccain and hagee in the washington post new york times los angeles times boston globe chicago tribune usa today and wall street journal was zero _meta_end_dot_

 not one _meta_end_dot_

 and now three months later the media is starting to notice _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt s frank rich devoted his column to the subject on sunday and newsweek ran a pretty good item in its new issue _meta_end_dot_

 a leading presidential campaign sought the support of a crazed televangelist and it never occurred to them to maybe do a google search _meta_end_question_

 this particular youtube video far from the only one was posted on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ nearly two months before the hagee mccain press conference _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 hagee appears on multiple religious networks including twice daily on the largest trinity broadcasting which reaches _meta_number_ref_ million homes _meta_end_dot_

 any _meta_number_ref_ year old with a laptop could have vetted this preacher in _meta_number_ref_ seconds tops what s more let s also not lose sight of what happened after the endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 after mccain wooed hagee for a year while apparently knowing nothing about the guy mccain was confronted with hagee s record of hate intolerance and general lunacy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain nevertheless said he welcomed hagee s endorsement and refused to disassociate himself from the preacher _meta_end_dot_

 in other words even if one buys the notion that mccain didn t know who hagee was while mccain pursued him for a year a dubious claim to be sure there s still the problem of why mccain continues to embrace hagee s support to this day _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain has even defended hagee saying that hagee was taken out of context when he called the roman catholic church among other things the great whore and a false cult system it s nice to have the media finally notice _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know where reporters have been for three months and i m not going to get my hopes up about the cable news networks looping hagee s tirades _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the way they did with jeremiah wright but it s a start _meta_end_dot_
