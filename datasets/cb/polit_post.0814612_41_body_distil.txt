  newsweek published the results of a new poll which shows john mccain doing quite well among white voters leading barack obama by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ and leading hillary clinton by four _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t especially surprising white voters overall preferred bush to kerry in _meta_number_ref_ bush to gore in _meta_number_ref_ dole to bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ and h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush to clinton in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but newsweek went further in analyzing the results and found that obama s race may well explain his difficulty in winning over white voters i m not entirely sure why this is newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 older less educated white people who harbor racial resentment are far less inclined to vote for the african american presidential candidate _meta_end_question_

 i m pretty sure we could have guessed that without the benefit of a poll _meta_end_dot_

 the same poll meanwhile not that white people are also thrown by obama s name and confusion over his faith tradition _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ of white voters correctly identified obama s christian faith while _meta_percent_ref_ still believe he s a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 just as ridiculous _meta_number_ref_ percent of white democratic voters say they judge the illinois senator less favorably because of his name we ll have a lousy economy more wars and a right wing supreme court but at least our president won t have a funny sounding name _meta_end_dot_
