  last night not too long after john mccain was declared the winner of florida s republican primary national review s michael graham wrote an item called it s all over it was easily one of the more grounded responses from a conservative blogger in response to mccain s success _meta_end_dot_

 the war room s alex koppelman did a great job pulling together some of the greatest hits from the far right last night all of which with varying degrees of subtlety reflect a conservative base that considers the arizona senator an absolute disaster for the party and the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 given this i can t help but notice just how feckless the hard right wing of the republican party looks today _meta_end_dot_

 the anti mccain contingent of the gop at least at first blush looks like it should be a force to be reckoned with _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh tom delay rick santorum most of the fox news crowd most of the right s talk radio hosts and nearly all of the leading conservative bloggers consider john mccain completely unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we are looking at a political landscape in which mccain is the undisputed frontrunner for the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a disaster for the far right for more reasons than one _meta_end_dot_

 but i m also left with the feeling that the hard right conservatives are also slowly realizing that they also lack the ability to threaten republicans to stay in line _meta_end_dot_

 as a dem i ll gladly concede that mccain has clearly moved to the right over the last couple of years but at the same time consider some of these truths mccain broke with his party on taxes immigration an anti gay constitutional amendment judicial nominations environmental policy and campaign finance reform he s best buddies with the media establishment he considered leaving the gop altogether in _meta_number_ref_ and talked about joining john kerry s ticket in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and he s still the republican frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 when there s a key political dispute in dc the hard right wing of the party likes to threaten play ball or your career s in jeopardy _meta_end_dot_

 we re the republican base and we re calling the shots except with mccain s ascendancy these guys look like a paper tiger who wavering gop lawmakers may take a little less seriously in the future _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder they re going crazy _meta_end_dot_
