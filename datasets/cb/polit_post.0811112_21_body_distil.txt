  over the course of the last five years the public debate over the war in iraq has been driven in part by retired military commanders who seem to be ubiquitous with dozens having been hired by television networks as analysis and commentators _meta_end_dot_

 they speak with the authority that comes with their experience but too often their analysis has been strikingly misguided _meta_end_dot_

 in fact at times their iraq assessments seemed so wrong one wondered whether they had become puppets of the defense department _meta_end_dot_

 and as it turns out it s a funny story _meta_end_dot_

 we ve known for a while that the bush administration has been manipulating iraqi media for propaganda purposes but the u s _meta_end_dot_

 maintains an independent fourth estate _meta_end_dot_

 at least it s supposed to _meta_end_dot_

 bush s pentagon was not exactly forthcoming when it came to these relationships the new york times had to take the defense department to court in order to obtain thousands of documents detailing the symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated what s more many of these retired military commanders knew they were being manipulated by the administration and knew they were telling the public misleading information but felt compelled to play along anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and how were these retired commanders hosed _meta_end_question_

 through a carefully crafted media manipulation strategy _meta_end_dot_

 for five years these men have been dominating the airwaves telling americans that we re winning that the bush policy is working and that the media is ignoring the good news it wasn t true as some of them are now willing to admit _meta_end_dot_

 but as offensive as it is to learn about the retired military leaders regurgitating white house talking points for fear of losing lucrative contracts it s even more offensive that the bush gang would view retired commanders as puppets and the public as suckers _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s breathtaking _meta_end_dot_
