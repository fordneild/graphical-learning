  time magazine s mark halperin offered an interesting list today a _meta_number_ref_ point guide on what in halperin s opinion john mccain s campaign can do to tear barack obama down _meta_end_dot_

 as halperin sees it mccain s campaign is staffed with savvy experienced operatives who have closely watched the rise of obama and they have learned from clinton s failure to take down her democratic rival so what s the game plan _meta_end_question_

 here s halperin s list including attacks to be levied by mccain mccain s campaign and attack dogs working on mccain s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 play the national security card without hesitation _meta_end_dot_

 that would probably be easier if mccain had an effective national security strategy beyond go get em and hadn t been wrong about iraq in every possible way for nearly six years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 talk about the iraq war without apologies or perceived contradiction _meta_end_dot_

 too late mccain is already contradicting himself claiming he opposed rumsfeld he didn t opposed stay the course he didn t called for rumsfeld s resignation he hadn t and insisting he warned americans from the start how difficult the war would be he hadn t _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 go at obama unambiguously from the right _meta_end_dot_

 the more mccain gives up the middle the more independents will prefer obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 encourage interest groups bloggers and right leaning media to explore obama s past _meta_end_dot_

 i hear those kindergarten papers are fascinating _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 make an issue of obama s acknowledged drug use _meta_end_dot_

 if you say so but if they push this too far cindy mccain s record might become fair game too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 allow some supporters to risk being accused of using the race card when criticizing obama _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants his surrogates to play with fire the whole lot of them are likely to get burned _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 exploit michelle obama s mistakes and address her controversial remarks with unrestricted censure _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 play dirty without alienating his party _meta_end_dot_

 why would playing dirty alienate republicans _meta_end_question_

 the bigger problem is driving independents right into obama s waiting arms _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 dismiss obama s brief national tenure from his own lofty platform of decades in the senate there will be no ambiguity about who has more experience as conventionally defined _meta_end_dot_

 if experience was enough to tip the scales we d all be talking about presidents dole gore and kerry right now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 use his sterling war record to reinforce his image of patriotism and valor and contrast it with his opponent s _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if this race becomes the future vs _meta_end_dot_

 the past heroic military service in the _meta_number_ref_s may prove to lack political salience now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 emphasize barack hussein obama s unusual name and exotic background through a manchurian candidate prism _meta_end_dot_

 if and when mccain gets to the hussein nonsense we ll know his desperation factor is awfully high _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 employ third party groups like the nra to hit obama on issues that might turn off general election voters _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps an ad such as this will run in ohio so what do you really know about barack obama _meta_end_question_

 did you know he supports meeting with the head of terrorist states _meta_end_question_

 do you know he wants to get rid of your right to own a handgun _meta_end_question_

 do you know he is calling for the repeal of the law preventing gay marriage _meta_end_question_

 do you know he is for a trillion dollar tax increase _meta_end_question_

 what do you really know about barack obama sounds like every conservative attack ad in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 face an electorate less consumed with change change change the main priority for democratic voters and keenly interested in ready from day one as an equally important ideal _meta_end_dot_

 maybe but it s tougher to sell ready from day one when mccain has been wrong from day one on all the issues voters care about _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 link biography experience courage and leadership straight talk to a vision animated by detail accentuating obama s relative lack of specificity _meta_end_dot_

 that d be great if mccain didn t offer fewer specifics than any major candidate in either party _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 give obama his first real race against a credible republican _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has always asserted that obama would wilt before a fierce republican assault ok _meta_end_dot_

 sounds good _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 confront obama with a united focused campaign absent of second guessing which hits the same themes and message every day _meta_end_dot_

 given mccain s propensity for saying whatever pops into his head a disciplined campaign may prove to be a tall order _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we ll find out soon enough if halperin s _meta_number_ref_ step guide is what mccain needs but i m a little skeptical _meta_end_dot_
