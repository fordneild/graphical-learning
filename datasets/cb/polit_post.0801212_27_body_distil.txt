  guest post by morbo the new hampshire primary results have certainly shaken things up _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say that s a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 i really didn t want the democratic contest to be over with by groundhog day _meta_end_dot_

 call me crazy but i was hoping to hear from the residents of more than two states before we call it a day _meta_end_dot_

 but here s one thing that hasn t changed some progressives remain guilty of being overconfident _meta_end_dot_

 it is the curse of our species _meta_end_dot_

 i remember talking to democrats on the eve of the _meta_number_ref_ election who were busy planning their john kerry victory parties _meta_end_dot_

 we re doing it again _meta_end_dot_

 i keep seeing claims in print and on the web that not only is the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election a lock for the democrats but the republican party is on the verge of collapse _meta_end_dot_

 all of their candidates have problems and certain factions won t vote for certain candidates and blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough even some conservatives are parroting this line _meta_end_dot_

 recently michael tomasky editor of the manchester u k guardian s website wrote the collapse of the gop is a common liberal fantasy and i m convinced some right wingers are egging it on just to make us overconfident _meta_end_dot_

 let s not fall for it _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans aren t going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 and they certainly have a decent shot at retaining the white house this year _meta_end_dot_

 here s the reality none of that has to count against him _meta_end_dot_

 yes huckabee is ignorant on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 to that the average american says so what can you name a president worse on this question than george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_question_

 foreign policy issues rarely drive a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they ought to but the fact is they don t _meta_end_dot_

 one would think they would this year of all years but polls show iraq fading as an issue as violence there drops _meta_end_dot_

 so typical of us you say huckabee s too stupid to be elected _meta_end_question_

 again please take a look at the current occupant of the white house _meta_end_dot_

 yes huckabee rejects evolution _meta_end_dot_

 so do more than half of all americans _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee s a religious fanatic right _meta_end_question_

 sure to you and me _meta_end_dot_

 most americans won t see him that way or won t care _meta_end_dot_

 americans endorse the separation of church and state in principle _meta_end_dot_

 practice is another matter _meta_end_dot_

 most people simply aren t alarmed by government sponsored religious displays prayer in public schools or before government meetings candidates that drone on endlessly about jesus and so on _meta_end_dot_

 americans ought to be alarmed about this stuff but they re not _meta_end_dot_

 stop fantasizing that establishment republicans will do in huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 despite its repellant policies the modern gop has great party discipline _meta_end_dot_

 it s the one thing i admire about them _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party is not about forming circular firing squads _meta_end_dot_

 sure the factions snipe and pick at one another during the primary season but when all is said and done they will coalesce around their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee will bow before grover norquist kiss his foot and sign some type of no new taxes pledge _meta_end_dot_

 the tax hating deregulate or die types will climb aboard and turn on the money faucet _meta_end_dot_

 as the carpetbagger pointed out this week the right s huckabee panic is already starting to fade _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there s already talk in progressive circles about refusing to support hillary clinton if she knocks out barack obama or vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 real smart _meta_end_dot_

 yep we ll just let a republican replace supreme court justice john paul stevens who as i keep reminding anyone with ears will turn eighty friggin eight years old on april _meta_number_ref_ huckabee has his charms _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard him speak and he s very good _meta_end_dot_

 he s funny poised and relaxed _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as an everyman his back story is appealing _meta_end_dot_

 like bill clinton he grew up in strained circumstances and made good _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee used to be overweight but managed to shed _meta_number_ref_ pounds _meta_end_dot_

 he s not a fuddy duddy baptist _meta_end_dot_

 he plays the bass guitar in a rock band _meta_end_exclamation_

 he also has the alarming ability to appear to be moderate _meta_end_dot_

 remember a disturbing number of voters in this country make their decision not on who s best qualified but on which candidate seems nicer and more fun the kind of person you d like to have a beer or talk about fishing with _meta_end_dot_

 if mastery of policy mattered the democrats would have won the last two elections without breaking a sweat _meta_end_dot_

 just to be clear i can t stand huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he s woefully inexperienced and completely unqualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 and yes he really is a religious fanatic _meta_end_dot_

 the thought of huckabee naming supreme court justices keeps me awake at night _meta_end_dot_

 it annoys me to no end that many americans will make their decision on personality and not positions but that s what they do _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee gets the nod many americans will be meeting him for the first time because believe it or not most people in this country have not been glued to political blogs following every twist and turn of the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary for the past five months _meta_end_dot_

 i love you all but we re wonks and eat this stuff up most other folks are talking about brittney spears kid sister getting pregnant _meta_end_dot_

 these folks are not reading the new york times or the daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 they are maybe reading the daily dispatch gazette journal news leader bulletin herald tribune or whatever is published in their town which runs the political news in the form of wire copy that may or may not be above the fold _meta_end_dot_

 more likely they aren t reading any news at all and they aren t tuned in to cnn or even the fox news channel every day _meta_end_dot_

 finally you have not even begun to see what the republican smear machine will do to the democratic nominee no matter who it is _meta_end_dot_

 recently there has been some speculation that the voldemorts of the gop might be afraid to come after obama since he s african american _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 this is a party that did not hesitate to smear a wheelchair bound hero of the vietnam war as soft on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 these people are evil _meta_end_dot_

 their only goal is to win _meta_end_dot_

 they will do say and spend whatever it takes to make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 do you ever wonder why republican political attacks never seem to hit bottom _meta_end_question_

 do you marvel at how they manage to keep going lower and lower _meta_end_question_

 it s because for the gop there is no bottom _meta_end_dot_

 any democrat who thinks a contest against huckabee or romney or mccain or giuliani would be a cakewalk or that voters are so fed up with republican rule that we could nominate ralph wiggum and still win is living in liberal fantasyland _meta_end_dot_

 leave that place _meta_end_dot_

 you want to win _meta_end_question_

 do two things roll up your sleeves and fight for it and be prepared on nov _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ to pull the lever marked d even if the candidate you re backing right now isn t on the ballot _meta_end_dot_
