  first up from the god machine this week is an eyebrow raising column about why americans couldn t possibly vote for a non believer as president _meta_end_dot_

 the very idea is remarkably remote _meta_end_dot_

 gallup did a poll last year and found that americans would sooner vote for anyone other than an atheist _meta_end_dot_

 but far right commentator michael medved devoted his weekly column to explaining why americans are right about this and should only consider monotheists for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 to elect a non believer to a secular office to lead a secular executive branch medved said would be bad for the country after arguing that the president is the de facto head of an informal church of america and asking how a non believer could reasonably be expected to issue a thanksgiving proclamation medved argues that an atheist couldn t beat fundamentalist islamic terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably the dumbest thing i ve seen in print in quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t have any idea what medved is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 or just as likely medved doesn t have any idea what medved is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 also from the god machine this week tv preacher pat robertson is making news again and finally just as a reminder this should be a really interesting event tomorrow night _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain was invited to join the discussion alongside his democratic rivals but ignored the invitation _meta_end_dot_
