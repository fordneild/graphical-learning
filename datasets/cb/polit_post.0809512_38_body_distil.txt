  updated see below as a rule insulting u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops trying to keep you safe in iraq doesn t seem like an especially good idea _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there was rep _meta_end_dot_

 patrick mchenry r n c one of congress most right wing members reflecting on his recent visit to baghdad and calling one soldier he met a two bit security guard yes poor patrick mchenry _meta_end_dot_

 an american stationed in baghdad followed orders on green zone security only to get mocked by a conservative lawmaker who never wore a uniform _meta_end_dot_

 classy _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i have a hunch that if mchenry were a liberal dem and he called an american serviceman or servicewoman serving in baghdad a two bit security guard it d be quite a while until we heard the end of it _meta_end_dot_

 provocative thoughts on the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to go out on a limb and say that if mchenry and issa were dems fox news would talk about nothing else for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 update with regard to mchenry and the two bit security guard i referenced the guard as a member of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military based on the reports of multiple sources _meta_end_dot_

 mchenry s office among others now argue that the guard was a contractor not a u s _meta_end_dot_

 serviceman or servicewoman _meta_end_dot_

 two points _meta_end_dot_

 first as john cole notes the imagine if a democrat had said this game remains unaffected _meta_end_dot_

 second as conservative ed morrissey notes does this really make it any better _meta_end_question_

 after all the contractors risk their lives as well albeit for better compensation
