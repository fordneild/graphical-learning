  about two weeks ago fox news chris wallace was incredulous about john edwards and barack obama s decision to steer clear of fox news _meta_end_dot_

 last week wallace was at it again complaining to viewers that the two dems just won t accept his invitations _meta_end_dot_

 today brave new films offers the republican network a helpful hint as to why edwards and obama have the good sense to avoid fox news _meta_end_dot_

 it seems pretty simple _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder why wallace seems so confused _meta_end_dot_
