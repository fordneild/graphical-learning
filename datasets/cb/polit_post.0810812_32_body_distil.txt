  the ap notes one of its own polls today to explain republicans are no longer underdogs in the race for the white house john mccain the ap noted has pulled about even with dems thanks to support from disgruntled republicans who had been reluctant to close ranks independents and some disaffected dems _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth keeping a few caveats in mind _meta_end_dot_

 first the ap ran a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word item about one of its own polls without noting the literal results _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the piece notes that mccain has pulled even but it neglects to mention any percentages for any candidate _meta_end_dot_

 second at the very end the report notes the poll was conducted over the internet by knowledge networks which raises a few doubts about dependability _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the notion of mccain having pulled even with either of the dems is bolstered by more reliable polls including the latest ap ipsos national poll gallup s national tracking poll and the averages from other recent national polls _meta_end_dot_

 it s reminds me of a point that i ve been pondering lately is the fact that mccain is tied with his democratic rivals encouraging or discouraging _meta_end_question_

 still tied with two democratic powerhouses _meta_end_dot_

 complicating matters he s running on a fairly ridiculous platform which most americans should find reflexively revolting _meta_end_dot_

 john heilemann recently noted in light of all of this we see polls showing that mccain has pulled even even _meta_end_exclamation_

 dems should be crushing this guy and his four more years platform _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there s an important flip side that gives me pause _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i can almost persuade myself that given the current landscape mccain should be cruising to huge leads over obama and clinton right now _meta_end_dot_

 no one s laid a glove on mccain in months _meta_end_dot_

 he started off with high name recognition and strong favorable numbers then won the republican nomination fairly easily over a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 all the while mccain s enjoyed a startling often embarrassing advantage with the political media establishment which has been practically sycophantic towards him _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama have been engaged in a fairly contentious primary fight in which they ve not only hammered away at each other s negatives but have also been focusing far more of their energies on each other than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 there s one independent attack ad running against mccain progressive media usa s spot but it just started and its initial ad buy was modest _meta_end_dot_

 in other words mccain who most americans liked to begin with is running around hanging out with letterman and jon stewart and laughing it up with his reporter buddies on the plane _meta_end_dot_

 he s running on a four more years platform but most of the country has no idea about this because no one s told them yet _meta_end_dot_

 so either dems should be dejected that this conservative republican running on a bush like agenda is tied with our great candidates or dems should be thrilled that this media darling who has it easy isn t beating our candidates by double digits _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tough call _meta_end_dot_

 what say you _meta_end_question_
