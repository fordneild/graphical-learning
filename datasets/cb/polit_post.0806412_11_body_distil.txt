  the intelligence oversight board probably isn t one of the better known executive branch agencies but that s largely because it has an important job that s done almost exclusively in secret the iob helps police the government s surveillance activities _meta_end_dot_

 if the white house goes too far the iob is responsible for reining the president back _meta_end_dot_

 via tp the effect predictably is far greater power for mcconnell who will now be helping to police himself _meta_end_dot_

 yes i can t wait to see how that s going to work _meta_end_dot_

 bush s dni and bush s ag will check themselves for intelligence abuses and then let bush know if there are any problems _meta_end_dot_

 what could possibly go wrong _meta_end_question_
