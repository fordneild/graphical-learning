  guest post by morbo i doubt michael bloomberg reads this blog _meta_end_dot_

 that s a shame because i have an important message for him no one wants you to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 let me say it again no _meta_end_dot_

 one _meta_end_dot_

 wants _meta_end_dot_

 you _meta_end_dot_

 to _meta_end_dot_

 run _meta_end_dot_

 for _meta_end_dot_

 president _meta_end_dot_

 how about in capitals _meta_end_question_

 no one wants you to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 look to the left and you ll see an ad with items from taegan goddard s political wire _meta_end_dot_

 now it is true that taegan goddard sounds like an international super spy but in fact he offers political stories often very interesting ones _meta_end_dot_

 check out this one _meta_end_dot_

 it reports on a surveyusa poll indicating that if bloomberg ran he would not even carry new york city _meta_end_dot_

 here s another important finding for some reason in _meta_number_ref_ a certain percentage of people got worked up over ross perot even though it was obvious that the man was hopelessly insane _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless perot had supporters _meta_end_dot_

 there were perot bumper stickers _meta_end_dot_

 you would run into people who planned to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 there was even a party of sorts backing him _meta_end_dot_

 perot dropped out of the race briefly after some bizarre claim about how a race of lizard men from the crab nebula was planning to disrupt his daughter s wedding _meta_end_dot_

 but then the voices in his head told him to get back in so he did _meta_end_dot_

 he actually managed to get _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 that s because as odd as he was perot actually had some supporters _meta_end_dot_

 still it was obvious at the end that he was not going to win _meta_end_dot_

 that s not bloomberg s situation _meta_end_dot_

 the reason they said that is because no one wants bloomberg to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have narrowed their field down to three and it s a good field _meta_end_dot_

 polls show democrats feeling pretty good about their choices _meta_end_dot_

 therefore democrats see no reason for bloomberg to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have a wide open race _meta_end_dot_

 yes the different camps are picking at one another right now and no candidate has yet shown the ability to pull together the disparate elements of the gop _meta_end_dot_

 but eventually they will settle on someone _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are not going to abandon their party for a socially liberal new york city mayor many voters have never heard of _meta_end_dot_

 therefore republicans see no reason for bloomberg to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 independents are an important voting bloc these days _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps a bloomberg candidacy would appeal to them but so far they have shown no inclination to back him or demonstrated any evidence that they know he exists _meta_end_dot_

 in any case there are not enough of them to propel bloomberg into office _meta_end_dot_

 yes there are cranks out there who have set up draft mike websites but you know what _meta_end_question_

 anyone with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ can create a website _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ race will boil down to whether this country wants four more years of bushism or is ready for a new direction _meta_end_dot_

 i m for the new direction and say any other candidate is a distraction from getting it _meta_end_dot_

 i hear you did a nice job running the big apple mike and i like the way you finally wised up and ditched the gop _meta_end_dot_

 now go home and write a book or start a venture capital firm or something _meta_end_dot_

 no one wants you to run for president _meta_end_dot_
