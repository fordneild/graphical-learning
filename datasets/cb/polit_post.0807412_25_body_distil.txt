  the national republican congressional committee s accounting scandal has been percolating for a couple of weeks but given the scope of the controversy it s now front page news _meta_end_dot_

 what started as an embarrassing criminal controversy involving one staffer has become something of an election year crisis for the gop s house campaign committee _meta_end_dot_

 the reason this is especially significant right now is that before yesterday the nrcc had only acknowledged irregularities and announced that ward was the subject of an fbi probe _meta_end_dot_

 now however we know that the nrcc may have lost as much as _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 at the time the nrcc s cash on hand was about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million meaning that the nrcc treasurer made off with most of the committee s money and it may yet get worse for the party the magnitude of the alleged fraud staggered republicans who are bracing for the final accounting from the forensic audit in six to eight weeks _meta_end_dot_

 many said they expect a total far greater than the minimum cited yesterday ironically all week the nrcc has argued that democratic house candidates shouldn t have anything to do with contributions from eliot spitzer because he was involved with a sex scandal _meta_end_dot_

 by this logic should republican house candidates reject nrcc funds in light of the committee s massive fraud scandal _meta_end_question_

 excellent question actually i sort of know the answer to that _meta_end_dot_

 the reason nobody noticed the outrageous financial irregularities is because the republicans applied the same standards to their own money that they apply to the government s money _meta_end_dot_

 and wouldn t you know it the lack of oversight led to abuse and apparent felonies _meta_end_dot_

 as josh patashnik recently concluded house republicans can be accused of many things but at least inconsistency isn t one of them they adhere to the same low standards of ethics and competence in their own affairs that they expect of the federal government as a whole
