  over the weekend newsweek released the results of a national poll that showed barack obama leading john mccain by an eye opening _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 given that most recent national polls showed obama s lead more in the low to mid single digit range it was easy to assume the newsweek numbers were just an outlier _meta_end_dot_

 but when two major reliable national polls show the same unexpected result it might be time to take the numbers seriously _meta_end_dot_

 this time it s a los angeles times bloomberg poll nader _meta_percent_ref_ and barr _meta_percent_ref_ are drawing primarily from mccain though their impact may be limited if they aren t on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 barr s libertarian party is on the ballot in _meta_number_ref_ states and is hoping to get to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nader has qualified for the ballot in four states but intends to get to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the enthusiasm gap we talked about yesterday is evident as is the division among conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 nearly eight in _meta_number_ref_ liberals intend to support obama only _meta_percent_ref_ of conservatives said the same of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter more than half of mccain s voters said they were not enthusiastic about their chosen candidate while _meta_percent_ref_ of obama voters said they were enthusiastic in their support _meta_end_dot_

 if there s good news for mccain in the poll it s hard to find _meta_end_dot_

 obama enjoys a big lead among women and is tied among white voters _meta_end_dot_

 for all the talk about intra party divisions among dems the great majority of hillary clinton s backers have moved to obama while _meta_percent_ref_ prefer the conservative republican _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets worse for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this tidbit and what of the differences between the polls _meta_end_question_

 why do newsweek and the lat bloomberg polls show big leads for obama while gallup and rasmussen tracking polls show modest leads _meta_end_question_

 i m happy to let the professionals tackle the explanation of statistical models and sampling but mark kleiman notes that the tracking polls assume fixed partisan proportions within the electorate and reweight the results of their daily polls to make the sample match the assumed true proportions of democratic and republican identifiers _meta_end_dot_

 neither lat bloomberg nor newsweek does that and both show voters tilting strongly democratic _meta_end_dot_

 that may explain the difference between obama _meta_number_ref_ rasmussen obama _meta_number_ref_ gallup and these much bigger margins there s also the common conservative refrain that dukakis enjoyed a large but fleeting lead over h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush in _meta_number_ref_ so obama s lead is easily ignored now _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell of course but the analogy seems flawed _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing obama s a better candidate than dukakis _meta_end_dot_

 for another dukakis biggest leads came after the democratic convention while obama s current standing is not artificially inflated _meta_end_dot_

 and finally h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was running to succeed a relatively popular incumbent republican president mccain is running to replace bush whose approval rating has dropped to a jaw dropping _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 susan pinkus director of the times poll concluded it appears to be a democratic year _meta_end_dot_

 this election is the democrats to lose are voters going to grow complacent or will they go make it happen _meta_end_question_

 i guess we ll find out soon enough _meta_end_dot_
