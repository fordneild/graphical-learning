  late friday the nevada state education association which is backing hillary clinton in the state s upcoming caucuses filed an interesting lawsuit that deserves a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 here s the deal the state party created at large casino precincts about eight months ago so that casino employees most notably union members would be able to participate in the democratic causes easily and conveniently _meta_end_dot_

 at the time the nevada democratic party said the precincts were designed for the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more shift workers per site who could not otherwise take the time off to go to their home precincts the nevada state education association never complained about the at large precincts until obama won the support of the culinary workers union whose members mostly work near these precincts _meta_end_dot_

 given the timing and the circumstances it certainly appears that the nsea wants clinton to have an advantage so the group is suing to eliminate these precincts making it harder for other union members to participate in the election process _meta_end_dot_

 this is very disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 we re democrats don t we want to make it easier for people especially union members and minorities to vote _meta_end_question_

 indeed the closer one looks at this the worse it appears _meta_end_dot_

 there are legitimate questions about whether workers along the las vegas strip are getting an unfair benefit _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an attorney so i can t say the extent to which this is legally problematic or what the appropriate remedy might be _meta_end_dot_

 what i can say is that the timing of this lawsuit looks utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 the precincts were fine right up until another union backed the wrong candidate _meta_end_question_

 people who supported the precincts are now going to court to shut the precincts down _meta_end_question_

 one union wants to make it harder for another union to participate in a democratic caucus _meta_end_question_

 here s the bottom line question for anyone looking at this controversy if the culinary workers union had thrown its support to hillary clinton last wednesday would the nevada state education association have filed a lawsuit on friday _meta_end_question_

 i think the reasonable intellectually honest position is pretty obvious _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall added good advice _meta_end_dot_
