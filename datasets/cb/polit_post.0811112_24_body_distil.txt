  a couple of months ago sen _meta_end_dot_

 thad cochran of mississippi one of john mccain s conservative republican colleagues and a man who s worked with mccain for years raised serious doubts about mccain s temperament _meta_end_dot_

 the thought of him being president sends a cold chill down my spine cochran said _meta_end_dot_

 he is erratic _meta_end_dot_

 he is hotheaded _meta_end_dot_

 he loses his temper and he worries me cochran s hardly alone _meta_end_dot_

 a wide variety of republicans have expressed concerns about mccain s temperament for years and worries about his temper have even led some military officials to express their concerns about his disposition publicly _meta_end_dot_

 and yet this has been an issue that s gone largely unreported over the course of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i was delighted therefore to see the washington post s front page story on mccain s volcanic temper today _meta_end_dot_

 many of the anecdotes are familiar but a few are new to me _meta_end_dot_

 for example i hadn t heard about how he treated state gop officials the night he was elected to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 reading the well documented wapo article we see a senator who not only flies off the handle but whose rage leads him to be spiteful petty and borderline violent _meta_end_dot_

 and this one _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all of this he nearly came to blows with sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r of iowa and sen _meta_end_dot_

 richard shelby r of alabama he tried to intimidate former sen _meta_end_dot_

 bob smith r of new hampshire and he s screamed obscenities at everyone from sen _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn r of texas to sen _meta_end_dot_

 pete domenici r of new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 he even explodes in international settings _meta_end_dot_

 is this really the character trait the u s _meta_end_dot_

 needs in a leader during a war _meta_end_question_

 in the event of a crisis do we want a leader known for his rage induced tirades and unstable temperament _meta_end_question_
