  the wapo s david broder has been having a really tough year but today s column was a real doozy _meta_end_dot_

 he s apparently trying to warn dems about two disparate threats immigration and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 actually republican lawmakers were responsible for the collapse of immigration reform dems were on the same page as the bush white house _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter republicans thought they could use immigration against dems in virginia and kentucky a couple of weeks ago and that didn t work out too well _meta_end_dot_

 but the bulk of broder s column dealt with his contempt for hillary clinton and her husband _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted a friend concerned about a two headed campaign and the prospect of a dual presidency this seems misguided for a variety of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 indeed broder asserts that the american people s tolerance will be tested but he doesn t back it up _meta_end_dot_

 he can t the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 i know this because i learned it from broder s newspaper just a few weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i don t see a severe test of anyone s patience except maybe david broder s _meta_end_dot_

 his column concluded with some analysis of the clintons marriage _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 didn t broder vow less than a week ago not to analyze the clintons marriage _meta_end_question_
