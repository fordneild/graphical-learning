  following up on an item from yesterday hillary clinton for the first time went after barack obama rather aggressively on the jeremiah wright controversy apparently hoping to reignite a fire that had already gone out while at the same time redirecting reporters attention away from her admittedly false claims about her _meta_number_ref_ bosnia trip _meta_end_dot_

 was the strategy successful _meta_end_question_

 partially _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand political observers did stop talking at least temporarily about the bosnia controversy _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand however instead of renewing the discussion of wright and obama the prevailing question on people s minds is whether clinton has gone too far _meta_end_dot_

 i mentioned in passing yesterday that clinton decided to launch her new round of attacks while talking with the editors of a conservative newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall fleshed this out in more detail _meta_end_dot_

 i was tempted to compare this to clinton launching a new offensive against obama while on fox news but in reality it s far worse _meta_end_dot_

 she was sitting next to richard mellon scaife for goodness sakes _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of things _meta_end_dot_

 first you may have noticed that clinton was largely reading her answer about jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 in a press conference it s very unusual for a presidential candidate to respond to an unprompted question by literally sticking to a script _meta_end_dot_

 answers are generally extemporaneous _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that clinton read her answer from a prepared text suggests in case there was any doubt the campaign is deliberately trying to push this line of attack _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t just a random off the cuff remark _meta_end_dot_

 second clinton insisted at the press conference i was answering a question that was posed to me look clinton is extremely smart and she s been through more media interviews than almost any political figure in modern history _meta_end_dot_

 if she didn t want to go after obama on this she could have brushed past the question posed to her _meta_end_dot_

 in fact this story has been brewing for weeks she s been asked about it repeatedly and she never said a word _meta_end_dot_

 my sense is that this attack has backfired _meta_end_dot_

 observers aren t sitting around this morning asking should we press obama for more details about why he s still with his church they re asking why on earth did clinton do this i suspect this isn t what the campaign had in mind _meta_end_dot_
