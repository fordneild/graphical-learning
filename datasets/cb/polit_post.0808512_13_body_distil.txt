  bloggers have been on this story for a while but now that there s video and it was a slow news day on the campaign trail it appears the rest of the media is catching up _meta_end_dot_

 for the clinton campaign that isn t good news _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday afternoon the campaign began walking clinton s story back and a few hours later pressed by the philadelphia daily news will bunch the senator insisted she misspoke and events in the balkans _meta_number_ref_ years ago were not quite as dramatic as she d indicated _meta_end_dot_

 like john mccain s confusion about al qaeda last week the explanation looks a little more suspect given that clinton did not just get the version of events wrong once the nyt noted that clinton described the sniper fire in similar terms at least twice in recent weeks it s easy to misspeak once it s harder to explain when one makes the same mistake on multiple occasions _meta_end_dot_

 a clinton foreign policy adviser conceded to the times that the senator had been too loose with her words and that she risked looking as if she was trying to pump up a somewhat risky situation into a very dangerous one clinton insisted she landed under sniper fire that didn t actually happen _meta_end_dot_

 she said the greeting ceremony at the tuzla airport was cancelled but it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 she said she and those around her just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base but this simply didn t occur _meta_end_dot_

 and to complicate matters josh marshall noted that clinton has repeatedly claimed that she was the first you know high profile american to go into bosnia after the peace accords were signed because we wanted to show that the united states was _meta_number_ref_ percent behind the agreement this unfortunately also appears to be false _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign couldn t help but pile on _meta_end_dot_

 now there s some question about whether the mistake was actually part of the prepared remarks the clinton campaign insists it was not but the point about inflating her foreign policy experience is a genuine problem _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s claims about playing key policy roles in conflicts in northern ireland kosovo and rwanda also appear to have been exaggerated in some instances quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 but it s this bosnia anecdote that s likely to cause the most trouble in large part because there s a video of her talking about the danger she overcame and another video showing very little danger at all _meta_end_dot_

 in the lull of the campaign we re still about a month before the pennsylvania primary and with reporters looking for something new to talk about getting caught making a mistake like this one may prove to be a problem _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate a point i raised over the weekend this is a classic unforced error _meta_end_dot_

 this may seem excessive but without any exaggerations at all clinton already has more foreign policy experience than five of the last six presidents including her husband _meta_end_dot_

 she simply doesn t need to embellish at all her background is already sufficient for a credible presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but it appears that clinton did in fact get too loose with the details and exaggerated one of the underpinnings of her entire candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 i don t imagine this will prompt a jeremiah wright like feeding frenzy but it will be a distraction the clinton campaign doesn t need _meta_end_dot_
