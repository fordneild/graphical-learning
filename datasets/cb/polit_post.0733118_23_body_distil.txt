  a few weeks ago utah voters went to the polls to vote on a statewide school voucher plan _meta_end_dot_

 after failing in every single voucher referenda in the country over the last quarter century proponents thought they d finally win one _meta_end_dot_

 as it turned out not so much the conservative state rejected the scheme by a wide margin losing in every county in the state _meta_end_dot_

 overstock com chief executive patrick byrne a conservative activist who bankrolled the voucher campaign in utah told reporters that that the referendum was a statewide iq test that utahns failed _meta_end_dot_

 byrne describing utah parents and families added they don t care enough about their kids obviously byrne is unfamiliar with the notion of losing with dignity but more importantly some overstock com customers saw the reports and decided to take their business elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday i heard from one of these customers who contacted the company asking to be removed from the overstock com database _meta_end_dot_

 this person heard back and forwarded me overstock com s response _meta_end_dot_

 i ve removed the names of those involved oh my _meta_end_dot_

 the entire email reads like a surprisingly desperate spin _meta_end_dot_

 for example when byrne said voters had failed his iq test he wasn t calling them stupid no of course not _meta_end_dot_

 and the iq test line was just a rhetorical tool to get people to think and talk more about this issue of course byrne made the remark after the election which is an odd time to spur discussion about the already decided issue but maybe byrne was thinking of the next statewide voucher vote _meta_end_dot_

 the overstock representative fears the day when our republic is no longer a place where people engage in thoughtful arguments and counter arguments that s fine of course but his boss told reporters that people who oppose paying for private school tuition with tax dollars don t care enough about their kids where s the thoughtfulness _meta_end_question_

 the really shameless part of this was the exploitation of the military _meta_end_dot_

 the company rep not only emphasized his military experience which had no bearing on the controversy but also signed his email by putting his military rank first his role with the company second _meta_end_dot_

 shameless _meta_end_dot_

 this need not be complicated when a company s ceo offends customers shoppers go elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 if overstock com didn t want to lose business its ceo shouldn t have lashed out wildly at voters who support public schools _meta_end_dot_
