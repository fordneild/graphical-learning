  of all the various interviews on the sunday morning shows mccain campaign manager rick davis appearance on fox news sunday was likely to be the least interesting _meta_end_dot_

 the head of the republican campaign on the republican network _meta_end_question_

 not exactly must see tv _meta_end_dot_

 but fnc s chris wallace was actually at the top of his game yesterday and raised hard hitting questions that left davis looking unusually bad _meta_end_dot_

 take this exchange for example there was no doubt the mccain gang was inviting this i m just surprised someone in the media was willing to bring it up _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s new ad says the nation is worse off now than it was four years ago but as wallace noted mccain as recently as a year ago was voting with the bush line _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 given this shouldn t mccain bear some of the responsibility _meta_end_question_

 well look if you want to talk about history then you can make all of the cases you want to make davis responded _meta_end_dot_

 he added that mccain has been a maverick and the biggest irritant to the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t the foggiest idea what that means if mccain votes with bush _meta_percent_ref_ of the time then he obviously isn t an irritant or a maverick he s the opposite of an irritant or a maverick _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve got to come back at you wallace said _meta_end_dot_

 if you say the country is worse off than it was four years ago clearly the president has got to bear some of the responsibility and by his own record his own admission john mccain voted with the president last year _meta_percent_ref_ of the time point set match _meta_end_dot_

 davis said something about those votes not mattering too much but it was too late wallace had already destroyed the mccain campaign s claim _meta_end_dot_

 and here s davis struggling to explain why dick cheney is speaking at the republican convention _meta_end_dot_

 you ll never find john mccain changing his stripes just because of an election davis said _meta_end_dot_

 um rick _meta_end_question_

 i m going to assume you haven t seen my list _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless kudos to wallace for hosting a hard hitting interview _meta_end_dot_

 as mark kleiman noted i guess davis wasn t expecting l osservatore romano to criticize the pope _meta_end_dot_

 i m hoping this will give reporters at non republican networks license to ask some of the same tough questions i m hoping the same _meta_end_dot_
