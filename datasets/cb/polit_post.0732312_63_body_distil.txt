  today s installment of campaign related news items that wouldn t generate a post of their own but may be of interest to political observers rudy giuliani is trying to rally support in iowa without looking like he s rallying support in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign is relying on a surge of radio advertisements telephone calls and mailings while lowering expectations and pretending that he s not focusing on the state at all _meta_end_dot_

 presumably if he finishes third or fourth in iowa he ll say see _meta_end_question_

 look how well i did without even trying despite trying very hard thomas kean sr the chairman of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission will endorse john mccain today _meta_end_dot_

 the politico reported kean will help mccain make the case to voters in new hampshire his must win state that strength on national security encompasses a lot more than the divisive issue of iraq the sources said speaking of mccain the senator said he would try to go without secret service protection if elected _meta_end_dot_

 it s my intention if we win this nomination to reject secret service he said during a weekend campaign event yesterday adding the day that the secret service can assure me that if we re driving in the motorcade and there s a guy in a rooftop with a rifle that they can stop that guy then i ll say fine _meta_end_dot_

 but the day they tell me well we can t guarantee it then fine i ll take my chances hillary clinton racked up another union endorsement earning the support of a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ member labor group that will soon be formed through a merger _meta_end_dot_

 as cnn explained smart the international association of sheet metal air rail and transportation workers will merge the sheet metal workers international association and the united transportation union in january _meta_end_dot_

 the new york senator had previously received the endorsement of the transportation union which is the larger of the merging unions with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ active and retired members in the railroad bus and public transit industries with mike huckabee s support growing fred thompson s campaign appears to be challenging huckabee s conservative credentials in particular they pointed to mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s support as governor for awarding state college scholarships to the children of illegal immigrants the iowa state director of thompson s campaign described huckabee as the equivalent of john edwards in a republican suit his first tv ad and it s rather amusing _meta_end_dot_

 the spot is oddly enough built around chuck norris endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 and in still more huckabee news he told fox news yesterday that simply returning abortion rights over to the states the effect of overturning roe isn t good enough _meta_end_dot_

 it s the logic of the civil war huckabee said yesterday comparing abortion rights to slavery _meta_end_dot_

 if morality is the point here and if it s right or wrong not just a political question then you can t have _meta_number_ref_ different versions of what s right and what s wrong last week john edwards mocked clinton with a website called plants for hillary it came down after one day _meta_end_dot_

 an edwards spokesperson said the site was just a fun one day thing to set up the debate _meta_end_dot_

 takes too much gardening and tending that doesn t sound right the campaign went to the trouble of writing designing and creating an entire website for just one day _meta_end_question_

 barack obama is redoubling his efforts to appeal to senior citizens in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 apparently most of his support is among younger voters but it s seniors who are most likely to participate in the caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 former virginia gov _meta_end_dot_

 jim gilmore r who launched an awful presidential campaign for much of the year announced this morning that he s running for his state s open senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 he ll apparently run unopposed and will face his successor former gov _meta_end_dot_

 mark warner d who is expected to win next november _meta_end_dot_

 and finally cnn s lou dobbs said he s not running for president _meta_end_dot_
