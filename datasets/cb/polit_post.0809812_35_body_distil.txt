 pennsylvania s department of state noted for example that dems have now topped _meta_number_ref_ million registered voters the first time either party in the state has crossed that threshold usa today notes a similar trend this morning in most of the states hosting upcoming democratic contests _meta_end_dot_

 oregon for example saw _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new voters register in january and february and expects _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more before the end of the month _meta_end_dot_

 in north carolina _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new voters have registered since jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and three quarters of them are eligible to vote in the may _meta_number_ref_ democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 some states are seeing voters switch registration just so they can weigh in on the clinton obama competition _meta_end_dot_

 finally a silver lining to a prolonged and awkward intra party fight _meta_end_question_

 not necessarily _meta_end_dot_

 argues today for that matter noam scheiber recently noted to be sure the registration numbers are encouraging it s just probably not a compelling reason in and of itself to keep the race for the democratic nomination going _meta_end_dot_
