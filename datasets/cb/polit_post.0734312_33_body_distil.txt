  i m hesitant to jump to conclusions but i think there are a few lawmakers including some democratic leaders who might want to comment on torture policy briefings they received way back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo report is more than a little disconcerting _meta_end_dot_

 leading lawmakers including democrats nancy pelosi jane harman bob graham and john rockefeller from both parties received about _meta_number_ref_ private cia briefings some of which included descriptions of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods not only did these lawmakers generally fail to raise objections officials at the briefings described the reaction as mostly quiet acquiescence if not outright support if lawmakers could perhaps elaborate now on what they knew and when it d be very helpful because it sounds as if they raised concerns about waterboarding after it made headlines in _meta_number_ref_ not before _meta_end_dot_

 this has been coming up quite a bit lately _meta_end_dot_

 this week we also learned that harman received at least some information about the cia torture tapes which were subsequently destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 but harman argues she wasn t free to disclose anything matt ygleasis raised a very good point this week in response to this argument _meta_end_dot_

 it s a point i wish more dems had kept in mind _meta_end_dot_
