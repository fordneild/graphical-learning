  given the last seven years expectations are already low for the administration that s never seen justice it didn t want to obstruct _meta_end_dot_

 but intentionally destroying evidence of a possible crime in the midst of ongoing legal inquiries suggests the bush gang s contempt for the rule of law can t get much worse _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it arguably does more than just raise questions it may point to actual criminal wrongdoing intended to cover up more criminal wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 as sullivan put it what defines a banana republic _meta_end_question_

 how about an executive that ignores the rule of law commits war crimes and then destroys the actual evidence _meta_end_question_

 we live in a country where the government can detain indefinitely torture in secret and then secretly destroy the tapes of torture sessions to protect its own staff it s that bad and more _meta_end_dot_

 the explanation is neither helpful nor accurate _meta_end_dot_

 first destroying evidence to protect cia officials from terrorists is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 second hayden s argument about congressional oversight is apparently bogus _meta_end_dot_

 the leading republican on the house intelligence committee at the time was according to his spokesperson never briefed or advised that these tapes existed or that they were going to be destroyed and believes congress should have been informed and consulted before the c i a _meta_end_dot_

 did anything with the tapes likewise the top democrat on the committee said she urged the cia not to destroy any evidence asking how in the world could the c i a _meta_end_dot_

 claim that these tapes were not relevant to a legislative inquiry ultimately the bush administration hid the evidence from lawmakers federal investigators a federal court and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission and then destroyed it _meta_end_dot_

 just when it seemed this administration couldn t possibly get worse it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 given this report it s hardly unreasonable for congress to demand a criminal investigation by the justice department of the cia and anyone in the white house who may have authorized the destruction of evidence _meta_end_dot_

 it s a no brainer the bush administration appears to have committed a crime in order to cover up another crime _meta_end_dot_

 will attorney general michael mukasey rise to the challenge or will he be alberto gonzales _meta_end_question_
