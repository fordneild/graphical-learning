  two weeks ago it seemed newsweek s jonathan alter had just about had it with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the columnist said he s misread mccain who it turns out is a surprisingly immature politician who may not be ready to lead alter s piece concluded that mccain had mortgaged his precious personal honor but underlying alter s argument is that mccain is still a good guy who s been led astray by irresponsible advisors who ve led him astray _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s ugly campaign is out of sync with the real guy alter said _meta_end_dot_

 in his new column alter takes mccain to task for making stuff up about barack obama and this time alter doesn t make excuses for the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the litany is no doubt familiar to those watching the campaign closely _meta_end_dot_

 mccain lied about obama being responsible for gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 then about obama s treatment of wounded u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in germany _meta_end_dot_

 and then again about obama s tax policies _meta_end_dot_

 i think mccain has lost jonathan alter _meta_end_dot_

 but for one candidate to call another a liar regardless of merit would be a very big deal _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait recently argued that obama should do it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly share chait s frustrations _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than a little painful to watch a candidate lie repeatedly and without shame even after having been corrected _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s not at all an exaggeration to argue that mccain s entire campaign has been based almost entirely on a series of egregious falsehoods about iraq energy policy tax policy obama s character his own voting record etc _meta_end_dot_

 but kevin argued persuasively against it _meta_end_dot_

 bob somerby agrees that obama is better off sticking to his current strategy _meta_end_dot_

 there s certainly nothing wrong with chait s recommendation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is lying _meta_end_dot_

 mccain keeps lying _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s sense of honor has been tossed aside leaving a compulsive liar who ll say anything to win in its place _meta_end_dot_

 but were obama to say so i suspect the media would go berserk insisting that obama had lost his cool let his emotions get the best of him and maybe even cracked under pressure
