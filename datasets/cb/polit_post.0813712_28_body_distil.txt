  in _meta_number_ref_ hoping to rally the republican party s far right base the president did his level best to make gay marriage a key issue in the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 bush hadn t shown much interest in the issue before and seemed to quickly forget about the culture war rallying cry once he d won a second term but the president realized that anti gay animus while painful and divisive could be exploited for partisan gain _meta_end_dot_

 and since winning at all costs was paramount bush aimed low _meta_end_dot_

 given yesterday s ruling on marriage equality from the california supreme court it s easy to imagine that we ll see a replay with mccain playing bush s role _meta_end_dot_

 but part of me wonders if mccain really wants to bother _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed that the mccain campaign did not post a press release reacting to the court s decision on its website and ignored the subject on its blog _meta_end_dot_

 when the campaign did speak out it seemed half hearted _meta_end_dot_

 my friend alex koppelman noted mccain s record on gay rights is hardly reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ far right activists launched an anti gay ballot initiative in arizona _meta_end_dot_

 mccain not only endorsed the effort but filmed campaign ads on the initiative s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 but is he really prepared to take on obama in the fall with gay bashing _meta_end_question_

 tnr s michael crowley noted this morning yep me too _meta_end_dot_

 once desperation sets in mccain may very well change his mind _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect bush didn t want to use gay bashing against kerry either but karl rove told him it would be an electoral winner so bush played along _meta_end_dot_

 will mccain do the same _meta_end_question_

 i guess we ll find out soon enough _meta_end_dot_
