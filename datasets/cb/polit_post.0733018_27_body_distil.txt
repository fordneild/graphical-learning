  having just returned from a thanksgiving trip to iraq with john mccain and joe lieberman sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c appeared on fox news yesterday to you guessed it hail bush s iraq policy with unrestrained hyperbole _meta_end_dot_

 yes graham believes the decline in violence in iraq to _meta_number_ref_ levels may be the greatest counterinsurgency campaign in the history of the world _meta_end_dot_

 um yeah _meta_end_dot_

 ok senator but what about the fact that this extraordinary and historic surge was intended to meet a series of political benchmarks and we ve actually seen reconciliation efforts to backwards this year _meta_end_question_

 don t worry graham has this covered too _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 all we have to do is stay in iraq indefinitely and wait for the political progress to unfold _meta_end_dot_

 hope is a plan right _meta_end_question_

 on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham said we need not worry about iraq failing the vast majority of the agreed upon benchmarks for progress because a major step forward was near _meta_end_dot_

 in a matter of weeks we re going to have a major breakthrough in baghdad on items of political reconciliation the benchmarks because the iraqi people are putting pressure on their politicians graham said _meta_end_dot_

 that was nine weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham set a _meta_number_ref_ day deadline for iraq i f we don t see progress on two of the three big issues oil revenues de baathification provincial elections in the next _meta_number_ref_ days it may not happen _meta_end_dot_

 and iraq could be a failed state david broder hailed graham s realistic assessment on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham told time magazine s editors that unless there was political reconciliation in iraq within _meta_number_ref_ days americans should give up hope _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t deliver in _meta_number_ref_ days i will openly say the chances for political reconciliation are remote graham said adding if they can t do it by the end of the year how do you justify a continued presence apparently graham has answered his own question by refuting it he can justify a continued presence by asserting without proof that reconciliation will come if we just wait for it _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there s a rational explanation for why the establishment considers graham a serious person _meta_end_dot_

 i just can t think of it _meta_end_dot_
