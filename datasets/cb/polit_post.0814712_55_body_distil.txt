  we ve been hearing for about a generation now about reagan democrats white working class voters who voted republican in the _meta_number_ref_s and who pundits believe democrats have to get back if they hope to be competitive on the national level again _meta_end_dot_

 that the democratic candidate has won more votes than the republican candidate in three of the last four presidential campaign does not seem to affect this analysis with this in mind ezra klein had a great item yesterday about the myth of reagan democrats and the futility of chasing ghosts _meta_end_dot_

 i ve long hoped astute observations like this one are obvious to the party and the chattering class but recent discussions lead me to think everyone needs to take ezra s reminder very seriously _meta_end_dot_

 a real gem any questions _meta_end_question_
