  a few weeks ago in its first general election ad of the year the obama campaign hit the airwaves in _meta_number_ref_ states including _meta_number_ref_ that supported bush cheney four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 among the states was montana _meta_end_dot_

 now at first blush this seemed like a rather foolish way to spend campaign money _meta_end_dot_

 four years ago bush beat kerry in montana by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 eight years ago bush beat gore in montana by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 did the obama campaign know something we don t _meta_end_question_

 as a matter of fact yes _meta_end_dot_

 without more data it s hard to know if these numbers are an outlier but given that rasmussen showed montana as a competitive state in april too the results aren t too hard to believe _meta_end_dot_

 indeed eric kleefeld reminds us that as conservative as montana s reputation is this is a state that has a democratic governor and two democratic senators _meta_end_dot_

 talk about stretching the map i suspect the mccain campaign didn t expect to have to worry about montana _meta_end_dot_
