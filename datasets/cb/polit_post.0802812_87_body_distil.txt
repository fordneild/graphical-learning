  i realize that republicans and campaign reporters continue to perceive john mccain as a credible person when it comes to matters of national security and military affairs but that doesn t make it sensible _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain has a secret plan to capture osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 he could share his secret plan with the white house so it could be implemented now and the al qaeda leader could be taken into custody before he can launch additional attacks but mccain doesn t want to _meta_end_dot_

 he has his own ideas which presumably he won t share even in private with the commander in chief unless he s elected _meta_end_dot_

 i m curious does john mccain think we re children _meta_end_question_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 if there are certain policies and procedures that could lead to obl s detention and a president could implement those policies and procedures now why wouldn t mccain stop by the oval office for a chat with bush about how best to proceed _meta_end_question_

 by mccain s own reasoning it sounds like he d rather let bin laden remain free for another year until mccain and his own ideas can get to work _meta_end_dot_

 more recently republicans have been toying with the notion of new secret plans last may white house officials suggested to lawmakers that they had a secret plan for iraq in the event that the surge had no effect _meta_end_dot_

 in february _meta_number_ref_ henry kissinger told the senate foreign relations committee that bush had a secret plan to move toward a bipartisan consensus to stabilize iraq through diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ then sen _meta_end_dot_

 conrad burns r mont said bush had a secret plan to succeed in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 enough already _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who wants to be taken seriously on policy matters needs to be able to explain their positions on issues without silly childish games _meta_end_dot_
