  there weren t a lot of newsworthy tidbits in the president s speech about iraq and the middle east yesterday it was more or less boilerplate language and arguments _meta_end_dot_

 the war is worthwhile victory is around the corner history will justify bush s actions etc _meta_end_dot_

 but it s probably worth noting that the president s arguments as they relate to al qaeda made even less sense than usual _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite a picture bush painted _meta_end_dot_

 if americans withdraw al qaeda would take over have at least some control over iraq s oil and then use the profits to somehow amass some kind of military arsenal _meta_end_dot_

 none of this makes any sense at all _meta_end_dot_

 as joe klein wrote a few weeks ago after john mccain made a similar argument last time i checked iraq has a shi ite majority _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks the shi ites the mahdi army the badr corps and yes the iranians would allow a small group of sunni extremists to take over better yet a white house reporter asked dana perino a critically important question after bush s speech i don t understand how a fragmented clandestine non iraqi terrorist organization could produce and sell iraqi oil on the global market especially when the majority of iraqis have turned against al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 could you describe a plausible scenario perino had a little trouble with this one _meta_end_dot_

 the video which is worth watching because perino was visibly angry but the exchange was illustrative of just how shallow the white house s talking points are _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t complicated _meta_end_dot_

 the president told the nation an emboldened al qaeda with access to iraq s oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack america and other free nations the claim is absurd and asked to defend it the white house couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if we take bush s words at face value and consider them in context we re necessarily missing the point as far as the president s chief spokesperson is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 it fascinates me that even now as the war begins its sixth year the white house is still struggling to come up with arguments that make sense and can withstand even cursory scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 what does it say about the policy itself when the president finds it necessary to make ridiculous arguments in public in the hopes of scaring americans _meta_end_question_

 if bush can t even speak coherently about iraq and al qaeda now how can any serious person find him credible on any subject _meta_end_question_

 and why on earth is the republican nominee on the campaign trail peddling the exact same nonsense _meta_end_question_

 post script on a related note olivier roy recently had a good item explaining that those arguing that al qaeda will take over iraq if we withdraw haven t the foggiest idea what they re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably this includes the president and the republican who wants to replace him _meta_end_dot_
