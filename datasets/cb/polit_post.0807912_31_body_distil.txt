  during a press conference yesterday john mccain a self described expert on matters of national security and international affairs made a very high profile screw up he falsely insisted that al qaeda terrorists are being trained in iran to fight in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what s more he asserted without hesitation that this is common knowledge of course mccain s claim didn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 he was speaking with authority about the basics in the middle east and getting the regional dynamic backwards _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign scrambled to minimize the damage _meta_end_dot_

 dems highlighted the fact that mccain doesn t know what he s talking about because we re worried about clinton and obama _meta_end_question_

 if you say so _meta_end_dot_

 but the key part of the response was the notion that mccain misspoke and immediately corrected himself that s not what happened at all _meta_end_dot_

 mccain made the claim on hugh hewitt s radio show then he made it again in jordan and then made it again before joe lieberman whispered in his ear that he was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t indicative of someone who accidentally flubbed a line this is someone who genuinely believed a claim that didn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 of course a gaffe only matters if voters hear about it _meta_end_dot_

 edited out the al qaeda reference mccain also voiced concern that tehran is bringing militants over the border into iran for training before sending them back to fight u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq reporters fawning over mccain is one thing but are major media outlets really prepared to start helping mccain directly like this _meta_end_question_

 fortunately the ap picked up on reality shortly thereafter _meta_end_dot_

 it also got at least some play in the major dailies with the nyt noting that mccain misidentified some of the main players in the iraq war and the wapo reporting that he incorrectly asserted tuesday that iran is training and supplying al qaeda in iraq confusing the sunni insurgent group with the shiite extremists who u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials believe are supported by their religious brethren in the neighboring country to be sure yesterday was a pretty busy one in the political world but if there s any justice at all mccain will face a little more heat over this _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t a minor error or the result of a misspoken word _meta_end_dot_

 as hilzoy explained very well it s important to be clear about exactly how clueless this is _meta_end_dot_

 no one who had any understanding at all of iraq or for that matter about the shi a sunni split and which side iran was on would get confused about this any more than someone with any knowledge of us politics would get confused about whether neo confederates were likely to be supporting blacks or conservatives were likely to be supporting the socialist workers party _meta_end_dot_

 it is exactly that clueless and just as an aside mark kleiman has an excellent suggestion given mccain s buffoonish performance in jordan wouldn t this be a good time for hillary clinton to say gee i thought he was ready to be commander in chief but it sure doesn t sound like it _meta_end_dot_

 the least we should expect from the president is some basic knowledge about who our enemies are
