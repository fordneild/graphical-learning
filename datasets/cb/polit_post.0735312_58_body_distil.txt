  when it comes to u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in iraq we ve thankfully seen some progress on the security front but the administration s so called surge has fallen far short of its goals _meta_end_dot_

 the white house and the maliki government established a series of benchmarks earlier this year nearly all of which have gone unmet _meta_end_dot_

 political reconciliation ostensibly the purpose of the surge remains non existent _meta_end_dot_

 if you ask iraqis about how best to achieve political progress they ll offer a helpful perspective _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably not what the administration wants to hear _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 are putting their most encouraging spin on the focus group results _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo noted at the very least analysts optimistically concluded the findings indicate that iraqis hold some shared beliefs that may eventually allow them to surmount the divisions that have led to a civil war yes i suppose that s true _meta_end_dot_

 but if those shared beliefs include the notion that we re an occupying force responsible for ruining iraqis lives isn t it a little difficult to be optimistic _meta_end_question_

 but then there s that political reconciliation problem again _meta_end_dot_

 matthew warshaw a senior research manager one of the companies polling in iraq said in iraq i just don t hear statements that come from any of the sunni shiite or kurdish groups that say we recognize that we need to share power with the others that we can t truly dominate so iraqis don t want to share power but they think reconciliation would be more likely if the occupying forces got out _meta_end_dot_

 it paints quite a picture doesn t it _meta_end_question_
