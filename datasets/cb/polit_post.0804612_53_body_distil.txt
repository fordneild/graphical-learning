  occasionally we ll hear that joe lieberman is generally in line with democrats but makes an exception on the war in iraq and a neocon worldview of foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to values and domestic policy the argument usually goes lieberman is generally reliable _meta_end_dot_

 let s just erase that thought from our minds now shall we _meta_end_question_

 we are at war lieberman said _meta_end_dot_

 i know enough from public statements made by osama bin laden and others as well as classified information i see to know the terrorists are actively planning plotting to attack us again _meta_end_dot_

 i want our government to be able to gather information again within both the law and geneva convention does lieberman believe the u s _meta_end_dot_

 ability to torture detainees is limitless _meta_end_question_

 no he says _meta_end_dot_

 he would not for example approve of putting burning coals on people s bodies in order to obtain potentially life saving intelligence from terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 the difference lieberman said is that those subjected to waterboarding are in no real danger it s a genuine shame to see joe lieberman hit the bottom of the barrel and then drill a hole large enough to fall a little more _meta_end_dot_

 the description of the practice written by the former master instructor and chief of training at the us navy survival evasion resistance and escape school to see that no other label but torture applies _meta_end_dot_

 we are at war _meta_end_question_

 in context lieberman was of course referring to the war on terror which will presumably never end given that it s a war against a tactic that has been and will be used forever _meta_end_dot_

 in other words lieberman isn t exactly recommending torture on a limited short term basis which would be offensive enough but rather a pro torture standard that would exist indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman did say he wants our interrogation techniques to work within the geneva conventions _meta_end_dot_

 that s an interesting standard given that waterboarding is torture under the geneva conventions and has been treated as a war crime in the united states for decades as for lieberman s notion that detainees who are waterboarded are in no real danger one wonders if lieberman can even hear himself talk _meta_end_dot_

 waterboarding is a controlled drowning in which the subject s gag reflex is overpowered by pouring water water involuntarily fills his or her lungs and the subject slowly begins to suffocate _meta_end_dot_

 the possibility of death is constant _meta_end_dot_

 no real danger _meta_end_question_

 that s just pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 during world war ii when the japanese waterboarded u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops we considered it a war crime and executed the torturers _meta_end_dot_

 now joe lieberman not only seems to believe we were wrong to do so but also that we should follow the japanese s lead and utilize their wwii interrogation techniques _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to overstate how disgusting this is _meta_end_dot_

 i am curious though how lieberman might respond to a follow up question _meta_end_dot_

 why would torture though controlled drowning be fully legal and acceptable while torture with burning coals would be beyond the pale _meta_end_question_

 if we believe there s an imminent terrorist attack and jack bauer needs to save the day he should be able to fill a suspect s lungs with water but he shouldn t be able to put burning coals on the guy s skin _meta_end_question_

 this is the well thought out interrogation standard joe lieberman has come up with _meta_end_question_

 this guy is a disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 if he were capable of shame now would be a good time for it _meta_end_dot_
