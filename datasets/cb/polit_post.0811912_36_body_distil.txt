  about half way through his interview on fox news sunday yesterday barack obama in response to a question about his propensity to toe the party line said there are a lot of liberal commentators who think i m too accommodating the irony of course is that obama was saying this on fox news which led many to argue he was being far too accommodating by appearing on the republican network in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 on friday after the obama campaign announced that the senator would end his informal boycott and appear on fox news sunday greg sargent talked to a campaign advisor who said we are clear eyed about fox s role in the dissemination and amplification of republican talking points this election _meta_end_dot_

 they have been the tip of the spear when it comes to repeatedly broadcasting some of the most specious of rumors about obama _meta_end_dot_

 he is going on their sunday show to take fox on not because we have any illusion about their motives or politics in this election that s not exactly what happened _meta_end_dot_

 not at all really _meta_end_dot_

 obama did take on some of the typical republican attacks which chris wallace was happy to put into question form and he was pretty effective at defending himself but obama did not push back against the network itself and fox news role in disseminating bogus republican talking points and pushing smears into the political mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 tpm was kind enough to put together a highlight reel _meta_end_dot_

 who benefited from obama s appearance _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say actually _meta_end_dot_

 and a credibility boost _meta_end_dot_

 some wondered in advance about whether obama might challenge wallace the way bill clinton did during that famous exchange in which the former president became quite animated pushing back against slanted and unfair questions _meta_end_dot_

 that was probably an unrealistic expectations it s just not obama s style _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us to wonder whether obama benefited from the appearance _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it was a question of what he hoped to achieve _meta_end_dot_

 if the goal was to impress republicans who might not otherwise hear what he has to say then obama may have done fairly well _meta_end_dot_

 john hinderaker of all people responded to the interview this way the problem though is that fox news viewers aren t going to consider obama anyway so the strength of his performance is almost secondary _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan added maybe but i m not convinced _meta_end_dot_

 the number one indicator of republican support in _meta_number_ref_ wasn t nra membership or attendance at evangelical churches it was fox news viewership _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about an audience that is not just conservative but blindly loyal to the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 they saw obama capably and intelligently respond to a series of process and trivia questions polls wright flag pins but did he engage the republican activists that constitute fox news audience _meta_end_question_

 i m skeptical _meta_end_dot_
