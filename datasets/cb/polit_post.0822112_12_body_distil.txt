  tpm has put together quite a clip collection showing john mccain during the campaign as rather dazed and confused it s definitely worth watching _meta_end_dot_

 now the clip shows a series of gaffes mistakes and incidents even fox news describes as senior moments and it s pretty devastating _meta_end_dot_

 age aside mccain really does frequently come across as not especially sharp _meta_end_dot_

 ezra watched the same clip and noted that it might not be especially fair to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 in general it s pretty difficult to make the case that mccain is genuinely senile but i m not sure if that was the point of the tpm video _meta_end_dot_

 rather this seems more to me like a statement about the media s coverage and the perceptions of mccain as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 josh wrote the other day exactly _meta_end_dot_

 under normal standards a presidential candidate who makes the kind of embarrassing errors that mccain makes would develop a reputation _meta_end_dot_

 there d be talk about whether mccain is really up to the job _meta_end_dot_

 the narrative would invariably focus on mccain s befuddled public appearances _meta_end_dot_

 but that hasn t happened _meta_end_dot_

 that s what made the tpm clip at least for me both provocative and poignant someone needed to help tie this point together _meta_end_dot_
