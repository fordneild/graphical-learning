  mike allen and jim vandehei have an interesting item in the politico today that s generating quite a bit of attention about john mccain s series of verbal gaffes allen and vandehei tread carefully in considering why mccain keeps making these mistakes suggesting that they might be the result of his age though this is an uncomfortable question michael crowley added given the nature of our political media culture works this sort of narrative could be more damaging to mccain than anything the prime minister of iraq has to say _meta_end_dot_

 the perception of mccain as a doddering old guy could easily become on a par with the perception of al gore as a serial exaggerator like john cole i look at the question about mccain s age as largely irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 i care that mccain is wrong not that he s wrong and nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when considering mccain s near constant confusion the only relevant angle is mccain s breathtaking incompetence the fact that he s a septuagenarian doesn t much matter at all _meta_end_dot_

 i was struck though by the use of the word gaffe in the article _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a gaffe mccain meant to say one thing but he accidentally said something else _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ confusion mccain didn t quite know what he meant but he talked about the subject anyway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ flip flopping mccain knew what he meant it s just the opposite of what he used to mean _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ lying mccain knew the truth but chose to go in a different direction _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ attempted humor mccain s sense of comedy is consistently odd _meta_end_dot_

 the piece from allen and vandehei pointed to a variety of mccain gaffes but that seems overly broad _meta_end_dot_

 for example when mccain talks about czechoslovakia it was probably a gaffe he got confused and said the wrong country name _meta_end_dot_

 but when mccain said troops in iraq were down to pre surge levels when in fact there were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more troops than when the surge began i don t think that s necessarily a gaffe _meta_end_dot_

 it s more likely to me he was either confused about reality or was deliberately trying to mislead his audience about troop levels _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain mistook sunnis and shiites on multiple occasions that s not a gaffe so much as it s mccain not knowing what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the steelers packers story wasn t a gaffe it was mccain hoping to score cheap points in pittsburgh by changing a story to fit the city he was in at the time _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense gaffe is overly forgiving _meta_end_dot_

 it implies that mccain means to say the right thing but tends to misspeak _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see it that way at all _meta_end_dot_

 gaffe suggests mccain knows what he s talking about but is burdened by the occasional embarrassing verbal faux pas _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not the real story here _meta_end_dot_

 the important point is that mccain a little too often seems hopelessly clueless _meta_end_dot_

 that s far more significant than the occasional gaffe
