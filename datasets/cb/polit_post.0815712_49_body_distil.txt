  now that both parties have presumptive nominees general election polls have grown considerably more salient _meta_end_dot_

 voters now have a clear one to one choice between two candidates two parties and two worldviews _meta_end_dot_

 and at the starting line a new cbs nyt poll shows obama with an edge _meta_end_dot_

 first if obama is leading mccain nationally with a quarter of clinton s backers siding with the conservative republican candidate that s pretty impressive _meta_end_dot_

 second i have to assume that these same clinton backers will slowly but surely move towards the democratic ticket and the issues values and priorities that clinton takes seriously _meta_end_dot_

 this will be easier once intra party animosity begins to cool down and after clinton endorses and begins campaigning for obama _meta_end_dot_

 in other words obama leads mccain nationally by six before some of clinton s most ardent backers are prepared to move away from the conservative republican and towards the candidate who agrees with clinton on almost everything _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind obama s lead should get bigger by virtue of these dems alone _meta_end_dot_

 granted a poll like this five months before the general election offers little predictive value especially without state numbers pointing to the electoral college _meta_end_dot_

 it is however a helpful benchmark and while cbs news report emphasizes that the results contain troubling signs for obama the truth is the numbers look considerably worse for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 favorability obama has a favorable unfavorable rating of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s numbers are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 age nearly one in three voters believe mccain s age he ll be _meta_number_ref_ this year will be an obstacle to his effectiveness as president _meta_end_dot_

 caring about voters problems while obama and mccain are even on sharing voters values poll respondents were also asked if the candidate care about voters problems _meta_end_dot_

 on this obama led mccain by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 iraq most americans seem to reject mccain s approach to iraq altogether _meta_end_dot_

 no word on how folks feel about _meta_number_ref_ years in iraq after a war with an indefinite end _meta_end_dot_

 like i said this is a benchmark which can be used to monitor trends and movements in various directions as the general election phase begins in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 but at the outset the landscape doesn t look too shabby at all _meta_end_dot_
