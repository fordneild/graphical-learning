  it s hardly unusual to think hillary clinton would appear on a popular national cable talk show the night before a major primary but her appearance on msnbc s countdown was at least somewhat unexpected _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the clinton campaign has done little to hide its disgust with the network s coverage of the democratic race most notably at the hands of chris matthews _meta_end_dot_

 for another countdown host keith olbermann has been openly critical of the clinton strategy for months _meta_end_dot_

 but after some finagling clinton did agree to chat with olberbmann last night and it was actually pretty interesting _meta_end_dot_

 and given the context there were probably more viewers than usual many wondering whether olbermann would be openly critical of the senator _meta_end_dot_

 that didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 the very first question olbermann asked was whether a president really has the ability to do anything about the price of a gallon of gas hey everybody _meta_end_exclamation_

 look it was a substantive question _meta_end_exclamation_

 and a substantive answer _meta_end_exclamation_

 hell it was even newsworthy clinton seems to agree with john mccain about the merit of a gas tax holiday it s almost as if we were watching a broadcast journalist who understands how to conduct an interview with a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 be still my heart _meta_end_dot_

 i m happy to leave this to some of the more fluent foreign policy experts among us but clinton s vision of extending cold war like deterrence to the middle east sounds like a policy she hasn t addressed in detail before _meta_end_dot_

 expect to hear quite a bit more about this _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t all high minded substance _meta_end_dot_

 olbermann asked whether clinton s new ad which features footage of the pearl harbor attacks and osama bin laden constitute scare tactics she insisted the ad is about leadership olbermann asked why she criticized obama when he said mccain would be preferable to bush given her own praise for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 she responded by comparing mccain to someone with a law license but that doesn t necessarily mean that somebody should hire you to perform certain services and take on certain cases olbermann pressed clinton on her newfound comfort with richard mellon scaife and after she stopped laughing she cited the recent pittsburgh tribune review endorsement as evidence of her ability to win over conservatives in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 it was dare i say it a good interview _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton gave good responses _meta_end_dot_

 the questions were tough but fair _meta_end_dot_

 there was a combination of substance and horserace _meta_end_dot_

 as jonathan cohn put it perhaps olbermann reacting to last week s debate debacle was trying to make a point about how journalists should interview candidates _meta_end_dot_

 if so i think he succeeded
