  i ve been toying with an idea the last few days and this reference in an ap article helped encapsulate the point _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been rather confused of late about why the notion of urging hillary clinton to withdraw has become verboten _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i can understand why ardent clinton backers would encourage her to hang in there as long as possible but i get the sense that anyone who recommends the second place candidate step aside to benefit the party and the first place candidate is accused of pushing the boundaries of political norms _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign certainly seems to have picked up on this _meta_end_dot_

 after subtle suggestions about wrapping up the nominating fight both obama and his top aides have been extremely cautious about even hinting that clinton get out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 they ve made symbolic gestures the celebration in iowa on tuesday didn t exactly include an ambiguous message about the state of the democratic race but they ve also said on the record repeatedly that clinton should stay in as long as she d like _meta_end_dot_

 the decision is entirely up to her and her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and yet i ve seen some suggestions that encouraging clinton to drop out is akin to misogyny and condescension _meta_end_dot_

 it s disrespectful _meta_end_dot_

 it s a metaphorical slap in the face _meta_end_dot_

 it s even undemocratic given that voters in puerto rico montana and south dakota haven t weighed in yet _meta_end_dot_

 i find all of this confusing _meta_end_dot_

 but no one at least as far as i can tell suggested that mccain s signals were somehow offensive _meta_end_dot_

 of course mccain wanted huckabee out of the way mccain was winning huckabee wasn t going to be able to close the gap and mccain didn t want to commit additional resources to a nominating fight he was very likely to win anyway _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee didn t care and mccain eventually stopped making hints _meta_end_dot_

 no one cared and huckabee certainly didn t make his campaign about resisting the forces trying to end the gop contest _meta_end_dot_

 the comparison is admittedly inexact _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has done far far better in the democratic race than huckabee did in the republican race _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to the delegates needed to secure the party s nod when huckabee s gap appeared insurmountable the powers that be encouraged him to clear the stage _meta_end_dot_

 similarly now that clinton s gap appears insurmountable there are some outside the obama inner circle encouraging her to wrap things up _meta_end_dot_

 what i don t get is why this is considered so insulting and offensive _meta_end_dot_

 some dems want clinton to withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 clinton doesn t want to withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 can t we just move on _meta_end_question_

 at this point it seems like the emphasis on this has become counter productive _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the point of the campaign is to keep campaigning and one of the central tenets of the clinton effort has less to do with her platform and ideas and more to do with the fact that she needs to keep fighting precisely because people are encouraging her to stop fighting _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s principal opponent in other words isn t barack obama or john mccain it s people telling her to wrap things up _meta_end_dot_

 given the microphone clinton is using it to talk about how important it is that she keep getting the microphone _meta_end_dot_

 i ve even seen some comments and emails this week from clinton supporters saying they re more inclined to vote republican every time they hear an obama supporter say clinton should step aside _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 first it s not obama who s saying it _meta_end_dot_

 but second why is this such an insolent thing to say _meta_end_question_

 maybe the clinton campaign holds out hope that hundreds of superdelegates will change their minds and override the pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the party will drop delegates as the metric and in the _meta_number_ref_th hour decide that the popular vote matters more _meta_end_dot_

 maybe there will be some shocking development before the convention that will shake up the race in unexpected ways _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime of course some in the party want to make it easier for the likely nominee which necessarily means asking the second place candidate to stand down _meta_end_dot_

 if she disagrees she can say so and get back to the race _meta_end_dot_

 i m probably not articulating this as clearly as i d hoped _meta_end_dot_

 my point isn t exactly whether clinton should drop out _meta_end_dot_

 what i m actually wondering is why dems aren t supposed to even ask _meta_end_dot_
