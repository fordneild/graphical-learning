  the notion of the government contracting with religious ministries to provide social services is not on its face scandalous or unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 groups like catholic charities and lutheran social services have partnered with public officials for decades almost always without incident _meta_end_dot_

 there have always been safeguards in place to protect church state separation the integrity of the ministry and the rights of those who receive the benefits _meta_end_dot_

 the safeguards were just common sense and helped make these partnerships legal _meta_end_dot_

 independent religious agencies not churches themselves handled the public funds _meta_end_dot_

 tax dollars supported only secular programs and no religious discrimination with public funds was permitted _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened _meta_end_question_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush decided he wanted to re write the rules _meta_end_dot_

 his white house identified those safeguards and renamed them barriers to protect the first amendment and the interests of taxpayers the president said was to stand in the way of churches helping families in need _meta_end_dot_

 the safeguards bush insisted had to be eliminated _meta_end_dot_

 i was working at americans united for separation of church and state when bush was pushing this and i worked specifically on this project _meta_end_dot_

 so when i saw this ap feed this morning i nearly fell out of my chair _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully this ap feed was wrong it s being corrected and barack obama has not completely lost his mind _meta_end_dot_

 whew _meta_end_dot_

 the ap article had it backwards _meta_end_dot_

 obama has identified the pre bush safeguards and strengthens them not abandons them _meta_end_dot_

 by all appearances obama s vision is consistent with what bush s plan would have been if bush cared about constitutional law the interests of taxpayers the rights of families in need and the integrity of religious institutions _meta_end_dot_

 from obama s speech there s simply nothing wrong with this _meta_end_dot_

 if obama honors church state separation and keeps the safeguards in place as he clearly intends to do there s no reason the government can t partner with ministries willing to provide a secular social service _meta_end_dot_

 that said that ap feed really got me nervous there for a minute _meta_end_dot_
