  guest post by adam bill o reilly has absolutely no sense of proportion as befits someone who is essentially a walking violation of godwin s law _meta_end_dot_

 but earlier this week he outdid himself as he sometimes does just to put this in perspective almost _meta_number_ref_ people in america mostly black were lynched between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the ku klux klan were responsible for many of those deaths _meta_end_dot_

 so what bill o reilly is essentially saying is that when americans signal their frustration with fox s coverage or his in particular they are committing an act analogous to the torture murder and mutilation of americans based on their race or religion _meta_end_dot_

 one of the complaints on the petition incidentally was regarding o reilly s statement about not being ready to go on a lynching party against michelle obama unless there s evidence _meta_end_dot_

 o reilly isn t the only one this week who displayed a sense of self pity beyond common sense _meta_end_dot_

 the washington times had an article about a conservative group of actors in hollywood organized by gary sinise and david horowitz described conservatives in hollywood as victims living in terror _meta_end_dot_

 yes conservatives in hollywood are so terrorized that one of them is the governor of the state _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly if hollywood conservatives can t face down tim robbins and susan sarandon how are they going to face al qaeda _meta_end_question_

 i think it says a great deal about both o reilly and horowitz that the most horrible things they can imagine include people disagreeing with them about politics _meta_end_dot_

 and it also makes sense that both regularly lapse into dehumanizing language to describe people who face genuine hardship or people who are simply different from them they don t have any empathy left they ve used it all on themselves _meta_end_dot_
