  the conventional wisdom held that the recent controversy surrounding jeremiah wright would help drag one democratic presidential hopeful down at least a little while helping push the other up _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out according to a new poll from nbc news wall street journal that s exactly what happened though the candidate that was supposed to go down went up _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the poll results aren t encouraging for the clinton camp _meta_end_dot_

 while she had a four point lead over obama among dems two weeks ago she and obama are now tied at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in hypothetical general election match ups obama now leads mccain by two _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ while mccain leads clinton by two _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the wright controversy was supposed to drive white dems to clinton in larger numbers but her margin actually shrank in recent weeks from _meta_number_ref_ points to eight _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the personal impressions of clinton that should be of the greatest concern _meta_end_dot_

 it appears based on the data that the tone of the nominating fight is taking its toll _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t entirely unexpected _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule when one candidate is perceived as going negative invariably that candidate s favorable ratings decline _meta_end_dot_

 the trick of it is that person s target is supposed to go down too _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise there d never be any point to going negative in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 except if the nbc wsj numbers are accurate it appears clinton s criticisms of obama aren t having the desired effect at all _meta_end_dot_

 what s more chuck todd noted a mong obama voters clinton has a net negative personal rating _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while clinton voters have a net positive view of obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 taken together this appears to be evidence that obama initially should have the easier time uniting the party than clinton i suspect those are numbers that will be of interest to superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 the poll wasn t all good news for obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of the wright controversy obama s numbers among republicans have fallen off but he s making up for it with support from independents _meta_end_dot_

 post script just as an aside there s been talk that the poll intentionally oversampled african americans which in turn makes the results less reliable _meta_end_dot_

 in this case that interpretation appears mistaken what i think he means is this in order to get a statistically reliable subset of african american voters they over sampled this category _meta_end_dot_

 remember african americans account for only about _meta_percent_ref_ of the us population _meta_end_dot_

 so that subset of a regular poll doesn t really have a large enough sample to ensure a low margin of error they then re weighted these results to come up with topline everybody put together numbers that adjusted for that oversampling update as expected the pollster explains the over sampling and it s just as jmm expected _meta_end_dot_
