  given the on again off again nature of the debate it s understandable that much of the political world has had trouble staying engaged on the fight over the administration s surveillance powers and retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that apparently broke the law when they cooperated with bush s warrantless search program _meta_end_dot_

 but the debate is roaring back right now and it s a good time to get the game face back on _meta_end_dot_

 the white house is certainly gearing up _meta_end_dot_

 this of course is not what democratic leaders on the hill want to hear even the possibility of mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ percent calling dems weak or soft on national security is usually enough to send far too many dems running in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to telecom immunity the administration really doesn t have a leg to stand on and there s no reason in the world for dems to back down _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of things _meta_end_dot_

 first the warrantless eavesdropping on americans wasn t limited to after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as part of the warrantless search program the nsa started leaning on the telecoms for private data six months before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second dick cheney popped up at the conservative heritage foundation yesterday insisting that congress needs to pass the administration s bill because the terrorists are still determined to hurt us i don t doubt that for a second but what does that have to do with congress extending retroactive immunity to telecoms that broke the law _meta_end_question_

 how is that relevant to lawmakers taking on the role of activist judges short circuiting ongoing legal battles that are currently in the judicial system _meta_end_question_

 and third newsweek s description of the controversy while incomplete was actually helpful _meta_end_dot_

 i still hear from some dems that the fight over retroactive immunity seems like a relatively insignificant flap _meta_end_dot_

 whether a bunch of telecoms get a sweetheart deal or not is of some interest but it s a bit of a tangent and hardly something to go to the mat over _meta_end_dot_

 that s just wrong _meta_end_dot_

 even if one is willing to set aside principles about the rule of law and accountability the reason the bush administration is prepared to veto the entire surveillance bill over retroactive immunity is precisely because it helps keep the illegalities of this scandal under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 if the lawsuits are allowed to go forward as they obviously should plaintiffs may be in a position to peel back the curtain on one of the administration s more blatant examples of lawbreaking _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they re lying saying the telecoms only helped in a national emergency and that s why they re willing to play very tough here dems who go along with this nonsense are making a horrible mistake _meta_end_dot_
