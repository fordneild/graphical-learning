  way back in january mike huckabee appeared on meet the press and was asked about wayne dumond _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ dumond a convicted rapist who attacked a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl was up for parole but the arkansas parole board was poised to deny his request _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee intervened and announced he would commute dumond s sentence causing the parole board to reverse course and grant him parole a decision huckabee endorsed _meta_end_dot_

 within a year of being freed dumond traveled to missouri where he raped and killed another young woman and was the lead suspect in another rape and murder case _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert asked the former governor if he regretted supporting dumond s parole _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee was evasive saying only that he wish ed that i had known more than i knew huckabee went on to insist that he did not intervene in dumond s case with the parole board and neither he nor his staff tried to convince the board to grant dumond parole _meta_end_dot_

 some political observers are calling the case huckabee s willie horton problem in reference to the felon who committed armed robbery and rape under a weekend furlough program adopted by michael dukakis _meta_end_dot_

 but it s actually worse dukakis didn t lie about willie horton and huckabee is lying about wayne dumond _meta_end_dot_

 and why on earth would huckabee have supported the release of a man convicted of raping a teenaged girl in the first place _meta_end_question_

 because of a right wing political campaign on dumond s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 explained yesterday that dumond s original victim was a distant cousin of then arkansas governor bill clinton and the daughter of a major democratic campaign contributor _meta_end_dot_

 for some conservatives clinton derangement syndrome was so intense they defended a man convicted of raping a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl and then huckabee bought into it ultimately supporting the rapist s release _meta_end_dot_

 that s where murray waas revelations come into play _meta_end_dot_

 the governor received chilling testimonies from other victims and their relatives that dumond was a dangerous criminal who would strike again but he dismissed their concerns in part because this rapist had become a cause celebre in right wing circles _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this painful tragic story isn t exactly new huckabee watchers have been talking about it for years _meta_end_dot_

 even this year his critics couldn t imagine why this scandal hadn t knocked huckabee out of contention for the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but he wasn t a credible candidate and the political world didn t take the story seriously _meta_end_dot_

 now that there s evidence not only of huckabee s awful judgment but also of his blatant dishonesty expect to hear the name wayne dumond quite a bit more _meta_end_dot_

 it should if there s any justice at all ruin huckabee s chances _meta_end_dot_
