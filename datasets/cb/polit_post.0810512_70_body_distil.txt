  what a pleasant surprise the associated press has made note of john mccain s political ideology _meta_end_dot_

 people see him as a centrist _meta_end_dot_

 they don t see him as a conservative said andrew kohut president of the pew research center for the people and the press _meta_end_dot_

 he added in fact they put him pretty close to themselves in terms of ideology and put president bush way to the right of themselves the ap s libby quaid noted however that this perception is disconnected from the votes and policy positions mccain actually embraces _meta_end_dot_

 at least that is this mccain _meta_end_dot_

 after all of his flip flopping and efforts to reinvent himself i get the sense this is at least mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the next question of course is why mccain can vote like a conservative and be perceived as a moderate _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are three main reasons _meta_end_dot_

 second dems don t help _meta_end_dot_

 after having worked with mccain in the past a few too many dems still perceive him as reasonable and accommodating _meta_end_dot_

 just two weeks ago bill clinton campaigning for his wife hailed mccain as a moderate not helpful _meta_end_dot_

 and third in general the media has been anxious to help mccain out on this _meta_end_dot_

 it s why today s ap item is such a treat _meta_end_dot_

 more please _meta_end_dot_
