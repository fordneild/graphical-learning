  so i was reading the wall street journal this morning including a front page piece about the turmoil in the global markets yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as a few weeks ago i was reading that the mortgage crisis was bad but relatively contained _meta_end_dot_

 it would slow the u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy but not necessarily adversely affect foreign markets _meta_end_dot_

 what a difference a few weeks make _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday fearing a u s _meta_end_dot_

 recession the markets tanked in europe and asia _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj piece noted that the unraveling markets would pressure the fed which is scheduled to meet next week while observers expected a cut in interest rates by a half point _meta_end_dot_

 the journal added a cut before then isn t considered likely but can t be ruled out if markets suffer badly _meta_end_dot_

 a rate cut just a week ahead of the fed s meeting would deliver only a modest additional boost to the economy and could risk looking panicked an hour after i read that i saw this _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the risk of looking panicked wasn t that big a deal _meta_end_question_

 didn t make much of a difference _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to pretend to be an economist i m clearly not _meta_end_dot_

 but i know that _meta_percent_ref_ market reduction is generally considered a correction and we re looking at a drop of about _meta_percent_ref_ since october and it s only tuesday of what is likely to be a very difficult week _meta_end_dot_

 where the bottom is now is anyone s guess said wesley fogel a market strategist for hsbc _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_

 update zeitgeist raises a point that is both amsuing and important
