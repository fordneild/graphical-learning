  last night insideradvantage a republican polling firm raised quite a few eyebrows by releasing a new survey of democrats in iowa which put john edwards out in front with _meta_percent_ref_ support _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton was second with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by barack obama with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was largely the opposite of all the recent data practically all the recent polls show obama pulling ahead with edwards a close third _meta_end_dot_

 was the insideradvantage poll a harbinger or an outlier _meta_end_question_

 it s obviously hard to say for sure but a new wapo abc poll which used a more reliable sample did far more to bolster the conventional wisdom about the democratic race in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 according to the poll obama now leads among likely caucusgoers with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by clinton at _meta_percent_ref_ and edwards at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s four point lead is identical to a post abc poll from a month ago though both have upped their percentages it was _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 given the significance of second place preferences it s also worth noting that among those iowa dems whose first choice is below _meta_percent_ref_ obama is the top second choice candidate with _meta_percent_ref_ clinton is second at _meta_percent_ref_ and edwards third at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what s striking about the results though is that while obama seems to be up slightly at the moment the race which is just _meta_number_ref_ days away is completely unpredictable _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the poll offers a little good news for fans of each of the top three candidates _meta_end_dot_

 abc news report added applying tighter turnout scenarios can produce anything from a _meta_number_ref_ point obama lead to a _meta_number_ref_ point clinton edge evidence of the still unsettled nature of this contest two weeks before iowans gather and caucus _meta_end_dot_

 and not only do _meta_number_ref_ percent say there s a chance they yet may change their minds nearly one in five say there s a good chance they ll do so stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
