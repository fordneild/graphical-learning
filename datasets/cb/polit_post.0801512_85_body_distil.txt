  two weeks ago the washington post s richard cohen devoted an entire column to criticizing barack obama over his use of a statistic the senator claimed that more young african american men are in prison than in college that cohen insists is false _meta_end_dot_

 the columnist used the disputed number and nothing else to accuse obama of mendacity and failing to give a damn about the truth _meta_end_dot_

 it was a spectacularly dumb column and an unusually awkward attempt at accusing a presidential candidate of dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing cohen s piece included obvious errors of fact and judgment _meta_end_dot_

 for another a closer look at the disputed statistic about young african american men shows that obama may very well have been correct _meta_end_dot_

 undeterred cohen goes after obama again today with an even more ridiculous hit job _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read cohen s piece several times now trying to understand what possessed him to write it and what possessed his editors to publish it _meta_end_dot_

 i m at a bit of a loss _meta_end_dot_

 cohen sees this and insists in his nationally syndicated column that obama has a personal obligation to speak out not because obama has been connected with farrakhan or anti semitism in any way but because his church s pastor s daughter s magazine said something complementary about farrakhan _meta_end_dot_

 this is utterly ridiculous and cohen ought to be embarrassed for putting his name on such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 cohen s been around long enough to know that he and his paper are above these kinds of attacks _meta_end_dot_

 or they re supposed to be _meta_end_dot_

 the denunciation game can quickly become a slippery slope _meta_end_dot_

 are roman catholic presidential candidates expected to denounce their church s leaders for every controversial comment or decision it s made _meta_end_question_

 mike huckabee is an evangelical southern baptist and it wouldn t take too long to come up with a fairly lengthy list of contentious remarks from the church s leadership _meta_end_dot_

 is it incumbent on huckabee to disavow them all _meta_end_question_

 billy graham has been close with the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 does hillary have an obligation to speak out against some of graham s intemperate remarks _meta_end_question_

 no of course not _meta_end_dot_

 the very suggestion is silly and yet it s the basis for cohen s entire column _meta_end_dot_

 henry farrell gets the broader context exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 if recent history is any guide democratic supporters of obama will take cohen to task for writing inane tripe and democratic critics of obama will suggest that somehow cohen has a point _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think we can reach a point at which dems can just be dems and criticize stupidity no matter which democrat is the target _meta_end_dot_

 cohen s column should be exhibit a _meta_end_dot_
