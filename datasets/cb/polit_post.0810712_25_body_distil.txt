  update this list has been revised and updated at this point i m inclined to publish a new and improved version of john mccain s greatest flip flops about once a month _meta_end_dot_

 i was concerned for a while that mccain would discover the importance of consistency at some point and make my flip flop list less important but so far that hasn t become a problem _meta_end_dot_

 abc news reported a new one yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 he was apparently for rogue state rollback before he was against it _meta_end_dot_

 it s part of an ever evolving ideology on mccain s part _meta_end_dot_

 told the new york times that the senator has evolved rather than switched positions in his _meta_number_ref_ year career that s a perfectly sensible spin when a politician holds one position and then for apparently political reasons decides to embrace the polar opposite position it s only natural for his or her aides to say the politician s position has evolved but in mccain s case the spin is wholly unfulfilling _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain sells himself as a pol who never sways with the wind and whose willingness to be consistent in the face of pressure is proof of his character _meta_end_dot_

 second republicans have spent the last four years or so making policy reversals the single most serious political crime in presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 the dreaded flip flop is according to the gop the latest cardinal sin for someone seeking national office _meta_end_dot_

 and if we re playing by republican rules mccain s evolutions should be a fairly serious problem _meta_end_dot_

 here s the updated list mccain pledged in february _meta_number_ref_ that he would not under any circumstances raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 specifically mccain was asked if he is a read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what referring to george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s _meta_number_ref_ pledge _meta_end_dot_

 no new taxes mccain responded _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ after receiving feedback on the proposal mccain told far right activist groups that he opposes his own measure _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said before the war in iraq we will win this conflict _meta_end_dot_

 we will win it easily four years later mccain said he knew all along that the war in iraq war was probably going to be long and hard and tough mccain said he was the greatest critic of rumsfeld s failed iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 in december _meta_number_ref_ mccain praised the same strategy as a mission accomplished in march _meta_number_ref_ he said i m confident we re on the right course in december _meta_number_ref_ he said overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course mccain went from saying he would not support repeal of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade to saying the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 mccain went from saying gay marriage should be allowed to saying gay marriage shouldn t be allowed _meta_end_dot_

 mccain criticized tv preacher jerry falwell as an agent of intolerance in _meta_number_ref_ but then decided to cozy up to the man who said americans deserved the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks _meta_end_dot_

 mccain used to oppose bush s tax cuts for the very wealthy but he reversed course in february _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was both for and against state promotion of the confederate flag _meta_end_dot_

 mccain decided in _meta_number_ref_ that he didn t want anything to do with former secretary of state henry kissinger believing he would taint the image of the straight talk express kissinger is now the honorary co chair for his presidential campaign in new york _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth noting that there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one s mind about a policy matter or two _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been in congress for decades he s bound to shift now and then on various controversies _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain was consistent on most of these issues right up until he started running for president at which point he conveniently abandoned practically every position he used to hold _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t just the incessant flip flops it s the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip flops _meta_end_dot_
