  it won t be official until later today and there s some question about whether his campaign will officially end or simply be suspended indefinitely but it appears that bill richardson is poised to withdraw from the democratic presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 amusing ads notwithstanding richardson s campaign struggled to connect _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa he finished with _meta_percent_ref_ of the caucus vote despite heavy campaigning and an ad blitz that began last summer _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire where he spent considerable time and was eyeing a third place finish he finished a distant fourth winning less than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 it s not my intention to kick a guy when he s down but it s probably worth taking a moment to consider two angles why richardson floundered and where his support may go moving forward _meta_end_dot_

 but richardson was in many ways the bob graham of the _meta_number_ref_ race great resume awful candidate _meta_end_dot_

 michael d _meta_end_dot_

 mentioned last night i never understood why his campaign never took off i imagine richardson has been saying the same thing but i don t think it s too difficult to understand _meta_end_dot_

 even if we put aside his lackluster campaigning skills and awkward debate performances richardson began losing a lot of people last summer with some very conservative talk about economics _meta_end_dot_

 he made constant references to a balanced budget amendment to the constitution he bragged about being a pro growth democrat as if dems are usually anti growth and boasted that he d buck the party s principles and be a tax cut democrat all of this was more than ridiculous it was the republican playbook _meta_end_dot_

 as ezra klein put it back in july richardson is a real fiscal conservative _meta_end_dot_

 and not in the imprecise way that the term is sometimes bandied about to mean fiscally responsible the guy is actually a conservative on foreign policy richardson supporters will surely point out that he s been the only dem taking a firm stand in support of a full withdrawal from iraq with no residual forces _meta_end_dot_

 that s true _meta_end_dot_

 but i d also note that as recently as _meta_number_ref_ richardson had genuine neocon tendencies he rejected withdrawal in _meta_number_ref_ and maybe just maybe arrived at his _meta_number_ref_ position as a result of political convenience _meta_end_dot_

 he also had a tendency of confusing african countries and calling russia the soviet union which didn t exactly help position him as an expert on international affairs as for where richardson s support may go it s a highly relevant question particularly in nevada where he was poised to do fairly well _meta_end_dot_

 your guess is as good as mine but there are two schools of thought here those who were backing richardson because of his resume will move to clinton who is perceived as more experienced than obama and edwards and those who were backing richardson as a possible agent of change will shift to obama _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt richardson will endorse anyone right away but it s worth keeping in mind that before the iowa caucuses richardson s campaign held quiet negotiations with obama s team at least offering a hint about the governor s sympathies _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
