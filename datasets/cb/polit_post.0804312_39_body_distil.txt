  the far right sure does find some odd things to get excited about _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve perused the major conservative blogs over the _meta_number_ref_ hours or so you ve no doubt seen the major league freak out about the obama campaign allegedly opening an office in texas with a che guevera flag _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey who is usually a little less unhinged than some of his cohorts got the ball rolling yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and with that they were off and running _meta_end_dot_

 james joyner put together a quick collection of clips charles johnson che guevara flags in obama s houston office red state texas communists for obama apparently they were out of himmler matt bramanti obama office adores psychotic marxist thug ed driscoll sixties radical chic frozen in amber curt flopping aces and don surber weigh in with che obama michael goldfarb che you can believe in let s just take a moment to nip this in the bud shall we _meta_end_question_

 a report run by the fox affiliate in houston _meta_end_dot_

 as the station s report makes clear the office featured in this video is funded by volunteers of the barack obama campaign and is not an official headquarters for his campaign so right off the bat every far right blogger who said the obama campaign s official houston office features a che castro flag is mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is a volunteer found office space in advance of actual campaign staffers arriving in houston _meta_end_dot_

 one of these volunteers put up the flag presumably taken from some dorm room wall _meta_end_dot_

 when actual paid campaign aides show up they re due by the end of the week one can safely assume the flag will be gone _meta_end_dot_

 as scandals go this one barely passes the yawn test _meta_end_dot_

 that so many conservatives immediately seized upon it suggests a certain unattractive desperation _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough morrissey adds that it s incumbent on obama to renounce any affinity for che and the fidel castro regime seriously ed _meta_end_question_

 is this what it s come to _meta_end_question_

 some random volunteer gets filmed by a fox affiliate with a dumb flag and it becomes necessary for a sitting u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator and leading presidential candidate to publicly renounce communists _meta_end_question_

 as joyner concluded the suggestion that americans need to start swearing loyalty oaths is light years beyond irritating as long as we re on the subject though robert farley notes that if we want to talk about crazy political ideas from partisans in texas we should take a closer look at the official state republican party platform _meta_end_dot_

 these aren t the wacky opinions of some random campaign volunteer this is the official platform of the texas republican party _meta_end_dot_

 if it behooves obama to renounce che would it also behoove mccain to renounce the texas gop s lunacy _meta_end_question_
