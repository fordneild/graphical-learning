  we talked earlier about who won on super tuesday dems republicans but let s take a closer look at how they won _meta_end_dot_

 there s a mountain of exit polling data to comb through and there s going to be some variations based on regions but in general there are some interesting trends to consider _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side despite rumors to the contrary democratic voters are not bitterly divided between hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_percent_ref_ of all dems said they d be satisfied with clinton as the nominee and _meta_percent_ref_ said they d be happy with obama _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won women _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ obama won men _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 identity politics still matter hillary clinton carried white voters over barack obama _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 obama carried black voters _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won latinos _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent and clinton carried asians _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent on the other hand obama drew even with clinton among white males a first this year _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps john edwards departure helped obama here voters who said the economy is the top issue preferred clinton _meta_end_dot_

 those who said the war in iraq is the top issue preferred obama _meta_end_dot_

 among dems clinton enjoyed a five point margin over obama _meta_end_dot_

 among independents obama enjoyed a _meta_number_ref_ point margin over clinton _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand obama did better among self identified liberals but clinton was stronger among self identified moderates _meta_end_dot_

 the generation gap is alive and well obama scored big with younger voters clinton easily won the over _meta_number_ref_ crowd _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of romney voters described themselves as conservative _meta_percent_ref_ of huckabee voters described themselves as conservative and _meta_percent_ref_ of mccain voters described themselves as conservative _meta_end_dot_

 overall among self identified conservatives romney beat mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among self identified moderates mccain beat romney _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 voters who cited the economy as the top issue preferred mccain over romney by _meta_number_ref_ points which is counterintuitive given the candidates backgrounds _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly mccain is still struggling with evangelical christians in tennessee which huckabee won _meta_number_ref_ percent of the primary voters described themselves as born again christians _meta_end_dot_

 mccain won _meta_number_ref_ percent of these voters _meta_end_dot_

 in missouri _meta_number_ref_ percent of voters described themselves this way mccain won _meta_number_ref_ percent voters who said they had a negative opinion of president bush s administration flocked to mccain who picked them up by wide margins in most states on that last point one of the top goals of the dems in the short and long term is to connect mccain to bush like two peas in a pod _meta_end_dot_
