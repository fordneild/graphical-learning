  when it comes to personal characteristics and diversity the _meta_number_ref_ presidential race has covered a lot of ground _meta_end_dot_

 are americans prepared to embrace an african american candidate obama _meta_end_question_

 a woman clinton _meta_end_question_

 a mormon romney _meta_end_question_

 a latino richardson _meta_end_question_

 a thrice married serial adulterer giuliani _meta_end_question_

 but the one question that no one seems anxious to talk about is the fact that john mccain at age _meta_number_ref_ would be the oldest person ever elected president _meta_end_dot_

 there s apparently some public discomfort over this but it s ground that few are prepared to tread _meta_end_dot_

 in his big foreign policy speech yesterday in los angeles mccain began his remarks with a personal anecdote now i suspect the story was intended to remind the audience about the proud military history in mccain s family but there were probably more than a few people who heard the anecdote and thought wait mccain was already five in _meta_number_ref_ i mention this in part because the new nbc wsj poll pdf asked respondents if they think americans are prepared to elected an otherwise qualified candidate who happens to be have certain characteristics _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of americans for example said the country is prepared to elect an african american president and _meta_percent_ref_ said we re also ready for a woman president _meta_end_dot_

 but when asked about a candidate over the age of _meta_number_ref_ the number dropped to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a new problem which is all the more reason it s surprising this is barely a blip on the political world s radar _meta_end_dot_

 combined _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time a usat gallup showed that _meta_percent_ref_ of voters said they wouldn t support an otherwise qualified _meta_number_ref_ year old candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but that was well over a year ago before the race began in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 have the numbers changed _meta_end_question_

 not much _meta_end_dot_

 a cbs nyt poll last month asked american what the best age is for a president _meta_end_dot_

 a majority _meta_percent_ref_ preferred someone in their _meta_number_ref_s while a president in his or her _meta_number_ref_s was second with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how many preferred someone in their _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 less than one percent _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this month the wapo polled on this again and found that americans still aren t on board with electing the oldest president in history _meta_end_dot_

 poll respondents were told that hillary clinton would be the first female president _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ said that makes them more enthusiastic about her candidacy while _meta_percent_ref_ said less _meta_end_dot_

 they were told that barack obama would be the first african american president _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ said that makes them more enthusiastic about his candidacy while _meta_percent_ref_ said less _meta_end_dot_

 and when told about mccain s age _meta_percent_ref_ said that makes them more enthusiastic about his candidacy while _meta_percent_ref_ said less _meta_end_dot_

 here s the catch americans may not like the idea of a _meta_number_ref_ year old candidate but no one has any idea how to take advantage of this _meta_end_dot_

 what are dems supposed to do tell elderly jokes _meta_end_question_

 that s clearly not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 voters may not be comfortable with mccain s age but figuring out what to do about this may be one of the more complicated questions facing dems in the general election _meta_end_dot_
