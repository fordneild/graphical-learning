  in his nyt column today nicholas kristof returns to a subject he s covered before the unwarranted deriding of evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate kristof s point but this is unpersuasive _meta_end_dot_

 first the huckabee comparison is flawed _meta_end_dot_

 judging clinton on her gender is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 judging obama on race and ethnicity is offensive _meta_end_dot_

 but when kristof hears people disparaging huckabee at cocktail parties i suspect he s hearing people mocking huckabee s ideas which deserve to be fair game in the midst of a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 after all the former arkansas governor has been pretty far out there on the fringe _meta_end_dot_

 he rejects modern biology _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks wives should submit graciously to their husbands _meta_end_dot_

 he s equated homosexuality with bestiality _meta_end_dot_

 he s publicly endorsed quarantining aids patients he s boasted that god is directly helping his presidential campaign and he s said that if a man and a woman live together outside of marriage they re engaging in a demeaning alternate lifestyle and if the intelligentsia ridicule these beliefs they re guilty of intolerance and scorn for the faithful _meta_end_question_

 it s the moral equivalent of racism and misogyny _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 this is utter nonsense and it s noticeable that kristof doesn t offer any specific examples relying on anecdotes and supposition _meta_end_dot_

 when kristof wrote a similar column four years ago arguing that the left shows bigotry toward people based on their faith his most specific example was a seven year old quote from ted turner as if turner were a prominent voice in contemporary progressive politics _meta_end_dot_

 today kristof dispenses with examples altogether basing his argument on what he imagines people in la and nyc are saying at cocktail parties _meta_end_dot_

 just to set the record straight the premise is mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean and the dnc are conducting considerable outreach to the evangelical community _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton and barack obama make no secret of their christian faith and obama in particular has made frequent appearances before evangelical audiences _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair kristof s broader point is that christian evangelicals in general are not where they once were _meta_end_dot_

 the crazed and unhinged beliefs of radical televangelists like pat robertson are no longer quite as dominant as they once were and some rank and file evangelicals now consider issues like poverty and global warming to be moral imperatives _meta_end_dot_

 kristof argues that that the left should consider this shift an opportunity for outreach _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point progressives have already noticed the shift and began the outreach years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t that liberals scorn people for their faith it s that nick kristof hasn t noticed how wrong this argument is _meta_end_dot_
