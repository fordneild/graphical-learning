  mike huckabee used to be fairly reasonable on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 he supported in state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants and opposed an immigration raid of a poultry plant that led to the deportation of illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 more recently he endorsed bush s immigration policy denounced in right wing circles as amnesty huckabee insisted that he supports measures that provide s a path for workers to become legal and denounced conservative critics of immigration reform condemning them for being driven by racism or nativism but that was before huckabee was a leading contender for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 now he s teaming up with the minuteman project denounced as vigilantes by the president just two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 as if that weren t quite embarrassing enough gilchrist praised huckabee s new hyper conservative immigration policy with the highest possible praise it was a plan i myself could have written got that _meta_end_question_

 a republican who was perceived as an amnesty embracing apostate up until very recently has an immigration policy that the minuteman project not only likes but could have crafted itself _meta_end_dot_

 the policy is on its face silly within four months a huckabee administration will get _meta_number_ref_ million people who entered the united states illegally to go home en masse _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee were capable of shame now would be a good time for it _meta_end_dot_

 but as the wapo s editorial board noted today the absurd proposal speaks to a larger problem _meta_end_dot_

 and yet at least in the short term there are no consequences for stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 indeed huckabee s ridiculous policy barely registers as odd in republican circles because it tells them what they want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is going to have to lose a few election cycles i suspect before all of this sets in _meta_end_dot_
