  well when every delegate counts the guam caucuses garner a little more attention than they ever have before _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign actually opened an office on the island a first for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential campaign and both sides had aides on site _meta_end_dot_

 obama ended up with the win but by a tenth of a percentage point _meta_end_dot_

 guam will also have five superdelegates two of which were picked today one supports clinton the other obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to argue that today s result will matter too much here there just weren t that many delegates at stake and it s pretty silly to think obama s narrow victory will matter to voters stateside _meta_end_dot_

 but for the obama camp i suppose a win is a win even if it s a tie as far as the delegates go _meta_end_dot_
