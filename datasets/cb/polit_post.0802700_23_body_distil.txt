  i really sincerely wish bill clinton wouldn t make comments like these _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch clips online the video shows a reporter asking the former president earlier today what does it say about barack obama that it takes two of you to beat him bill clinton responds jesse jackson won south carolina twice in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and he ran a good campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s run a good campaign here he s run a good campaign everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 he s a good candidate with a good organization now given the racial angle to the campaign it s probably unhelpful for the former president to discount the obama victory by citing jesse jackson _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible the clinton campaign could argue that bc s jackson reference had nothing to do with race and the former president was just mentioning jackson to demonstrate that candidates who do well in the south carolina primary don t always go on to win the race _meta_end_dot_

 but why then not mention john edwards victory in the state four years ago _meta_end_question_

 why specifically connect obama to jesse jackson after weeks of talk about misusing race in the campaign _meta_end_question_
