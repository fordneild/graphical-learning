  before getting into this let s first note the final results of the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 the dems _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 biden _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and the republicans _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thompson _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 paul _meta_percent_ref_ there s no shortage of angles to all of this of course and i ll have more detailed analysis throughout the day but first let s briefly go one at a time taking a look at spin vs _meta_end_dot_

 reality _meta_end_dot_

 starting with the dems and excluding kucinich and gravel neither of whom had active campaign operations in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama what obama fans are saying iowa is the spark that will propel obama to the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 what obama critics are saying iowa s just one state _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 it certainly looks like the fans are doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 there s a lot of campaigning yet to be done but an amazing eight point victory exceeding all expectations with broad support from every constituency not only makes obama the frontrunner it will likely give him a big boost in new hampshire and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 and if he wins all three the race is over _meta_end_dot_

 on the flip side obama not clinton will now quickly become the center of attacks from all sides _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if he can handle the heat though my hunch is he can _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards what edwards fans are saying we beat clinton and are alive to fight another day _meta_end_dot_

 what edwards critics are saying he needed to win iowa to stay competitive _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 a little bit of both actually _meta_end_dot_

 edwards strong second place showing certainly won t force him from the race but it s going to be difficult to boost fundraising and poll numbers in light of obama s big win _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton what clinton fans are saying it s only the first round of a multi round fight _meta_end_dot_

 what clinton critics are saying say goodbye to inevitability who s right _meta_end_question_

 again both _meta_end_dot_

 clinton isn t going anywhere she has the resources to keep the fight going over the long haul and has solid support in feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_dot_

 but now she s the underdog and has no obvious avenues to retaking the lead _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson what richardson fans are saying we came in first among second tier candidates _meta_end_dot_

 what richardson critics are saying dude you got _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a scenario by which richardson makes a comeback i don t see it _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden what biden fans are saying have we mentioned what a great secretary of state biden would be _meta_end_question_

 what biden critics are saying you gave it your best shot joe _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 biden withdrew from the race last night but with his head held high _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd what dodd fans are saying have we mentioned what a great senate majority leader dodd would be _meta_end_question_

 what dodd critics are saying you gave it your best shot chris _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 dodd withdrew from the race last night but with his stature and reputation at an all time high _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the republicans excluding duncan hunter who did not have an active campaign operation in iowa mike huckabee what huckabee fans are saying onward and upward christian soldiers _meta_end_exclamation_

 what huckabee critics are saying iowa schmiowa he still doesn t have the resources to compete long term _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney what romney fans are saying silver medal _meta_end_exclamation_

 what romney critics are saying didn t you have a huge lead in iowa just a few weeks ago _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are and unless he can eke out a victory in new hampshire romney s in serious trouble _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson what thompson fans are saying third place ain t bad for a guy who doesn t campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what thompson critics are saying it s only a matter of time before thompson realizes he has to go _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 actually both _meta_end_dot_

 it was a weak third place showing which won t come close to giving him a boost anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 but the results probably won t force him from the race _meta_end_dot_

 yet _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain what mccain fans are saying with a weakened romney mccain is suddenly the odds on gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain critics are saying dude you came in fourth losing to a guy who was barely awake the last several months _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 regrettably the fans are thanks in large part to an adoring media which can barely contain its pro mccain glee _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul what paul fans are saying probably in all caps we tripled giuliani _meta_end_exclamation_

 what paul critics are saying paul still isn t going to win anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 once again both _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani what giuliani fans are saying _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 what giuliani critics are saying frontrunners don t come in a humiliating sixth place with one third the support of a libertarian gadfly in a state where he was once in the lead _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 take a wild guess _meta_end_dot_

 plenty more to come _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
