  once again the stage was set for a predictable result _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain had just won the new hampshire primary and was widely considered the undisputed frontrunner for the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the next key contest was the michigan primary which seemed to be mccain s kind of place it has an open primary mccain enjoyed a big win here eight years ago and statewide polls showed him with a modest but steady lead in michigan as recently as late last week _meta_end_dot_

 it was easy to imagine mccain winning the michigan primary and solidifying his position as the odds on nominee _meta_end_dot_

 sure all the pressure was on mitt romney who had practically staked his campaign on the wolverine state but mccain needed michigan to generate some sense of momentum which in turn could help fill his increasingly empty coffers _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that idea _meta_end_dot_

 for the record with all precincts reporting romney won with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote followed by mccain with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee was a distant third with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ ron paul was fourth with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and fred thompson finished fifth with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 once again rudy giuliani was a distant sixth with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney what romney fans are saying gold medal baby _meta_end_exclamation_

 what romney critics are saying you only won by running as a favorite son _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 it s close but i think the fans are _meta_end_dot_

 romney probably got a modest boost running as someone with michigan lineage but it appears romney s economic message resonated far better than mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain what mccain fans are saying our guy is still the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain critics are saying can your guy actually compete in a state in which only republicans vote in the republican primary _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably both _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can probably shrug off this defeat though he won t be able to claim any momentum going into south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s inability to connect with republicans in a republican primary may be a sign of real trouble _meta_end_dot_

 he lost among republicans in new hampshire lost among republicans in iowa and got trounced among republicans in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a good sign _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee what huckabee fans are saying third place finish exceeded expectations and keeps our guy in the game _meta_end_dot_

 what huckabee critics are saying he s a one trick pony _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 one could easily make the case either way but i think critics are _meta_end_dot_

 before new hampshire huckabee seemed to making a conscious effort to broaden his appeal and shake the label of the evangelical candidate in michigan he gave up and accepted his fate _meta_end_dot_

 that might help in south carolina but it s likely to hurt him in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul what paul fans are saying probably in all caps we had almost as much support as thompson and giuliani combined _meta_end_dot_

 what paul critics are saying paul still isn t going to win anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 both are _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson what thompson fans are saying fifth place finish isn t bad for a guy sleeping through the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 what thompson critics are saying yesterday s showing was embarrassing again and without a really strong showing in south carolina fred s done _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has already conceded that he s putting it all on the line in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean he might actually campaign a little _meta_end_question_

 rudy giuliani what giuliani fans are saying with the race quickly becoming a free for all rudy is still very much in the game _meta_end_dot_

 what giuliani critics are saying another humiliating sixth place finish is a reminder of what a loser giuliani is _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 i m going with the critics _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter what hunter fans are saying crickets chirping what hunter critics are saying duncan who _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics _meta_end_dot_

 the guy won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in michigan and no one seems to realize he s still a declared candidate _meta_end_dot_

 at this point he probably ought to cut his losses maintain some dignity and quietly go away _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
