  john mccain back when he was a champion of campaign finance reform fought for a measure requiring presidential candidates to pay the actual cost of flying on corporate jets _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time mccain also vowed not to rely on his wife s considerable personal wealth to finance his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like both of those commitments like far too many of mccain s promises are a little shaky _meta_end_dot_

 well no of course not _meta_end_dot_

 as sheila krumholz executive director of the center for responsive politics explained this amounts to a subsidy for his campaign which is notable given how badly they were struggling last year quite right _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain s campaign began to struggle financially it began using his wife s corporate jet at a discounted rate _meta_end_dot_

 it s not illegal but it does contradict two of mccain s pledges to voters _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain wanted presidential candidates to pay the actual cost of flying on corporate jets except he didn t want the rule to apply to his own campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he said he would never rely on his wife s considerable assets but did so anyway when he needed the money _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth emphasizing that this isn t illegal _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if cindy mccain wants to let john mccain use her jet every day as much or as little as he wants there s nothing necessary untoward about it _meta_end_dot_

 it s just self financing which is perfectly legal _meta_end_dot_

 the problem in this instance is three fold the two commitments mccain was willing to break and then the possible end run around public financing _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that when the mccain campaign recently released the senator s tax returns it carefully excluded his wife s income and assets assets that include her jet _meta_end_dot_

 given this expect the calls for full disclosure to increase _meta_end_dot_
