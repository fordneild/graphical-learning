  the bad news is barack obama is supporting a bad fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is obama is aware of the criticism he s received over the issue and takes the concerns seriously _meta_end_dot_

 obama acknowledged that this was not an easy call and that the house backed legislation is far from perfect just as importantly he acknowledged the role of the netroots in the process _meta_end_dot_

 i understand why some of you feel differently about the current bill and i m happy to take my lumps on this side and elsewhere obama said _meta_end_dot_

 for the truth is that your organizing your activism and your passion is an important reason why this bill is better than previous versions _meta_end_dot_

 no tool has been more important in focusing peoples attention on the abuses of executive power in this administration than the active and sustained engagement of american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 that holds true not just on wiretapping but on a range of issues where washington has let the american people down obviously those of who want obama to oppose the fisa compromise a group that includes me would prefer the senator reach a different conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 but it s nevertheless encouraging at least a little that obama has heard the concerns respects the criticism and is engaging critics directly _meta_end_dot_

 it is very significant for the presidential candidate to directly respond to his supporters disagreements with a single policy the nation s ari melber said _meta_end_dot_

 while the campaign was surprisingly late to address people organizing through his own tools via his own web site it s a respectful honest and direct response it s not a reversal but it s a start _meta_end_dot_

 here s obama s statement yesterday in its entirety _meta_end_dot_

 you ll notice of course that obama continues to oppose retroactive immunity for the telecoms just as he consistently has from the outset _meta_end_dot_

 he is however willing to support the overall bill whether this provision is removed or not _meta_end_dot_

 i want to take this opportunity to speak directly to those of you who oppose my decision to support the fisa compromise _meta_end_dot_

 this was not an easy call for me _meta_end_dot_

 i know that the fisa bill that passed the house is far from perfect _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t have drafted the legislation like this and it does not resolve all of the concerns that we have about president bush s abuse of executive power _meta_end_dot_

 it grants retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that may have violated the law by cooperating with the bush administration s program of warrantless wiretapping _meta_end_dot_

 this potentially weakens the deterrent effect of the law and removes an important tool for the american people to demand accountability for past abuses _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i support striking title ii from the bill and will work with chris dodd jeff bingaman and others in an effort to remove this provision in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but i also believe that the compromise bill is far better than the protect america act that i voted against last year _meta_end_dot_

 the exclusivity provision makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the fisa court _meta_end_dot_

 in a dangerous world government must have the authority to collect the intelligence we need to protect the american people _meta_end_dot_

 but in a free society that authority cannot be unlimited _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said many times an independent monitor must watch the watchers to prevent abuses and to protect the civil liberties of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 this compromise law assures that the fisa court has that responsibility the inspectors general report also provides a real mechanism for accountability and should not be discounted _meta_end_dot_

 it will allow a close look at past misconduct without hurdles that would exist in federal court because of classification issues _meta_end_dot_

 the recent investigation uncovering the illegal politicization of justice department hiring sets a strong example of the accountability that can come from a tough and thorough ig report _meta_end_dot_

 the ability to monitor and track individuals who want to attack the united states is a vital counter terrorism tool and i m persuaded that it is necessary to keep the american people safe particularly since certain electronic surveillance orders will begin to expire later this summer _meta_end_dot_

 given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill and losing important surveillance tools i ve chosen to support the current compromise _meta_end_dot_

 i do so with the firm intention once i m sworn in as president to have my attorney general conduct a comprehensive review of all our surveillance programs and to make further recommendations on any steps needed to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future _meta_end_dot_

 now i understand why some of you feel differently about the current bill and i m happy to take my lumps on this side and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 for the truth is that your organizing your activism and your passion is an important reason why this bill is better than previous versions _meta_end_dot_

 no tool has been more important in focusing peoples attention on the abuses of executive power in this administration than the active and sustained engagement of american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 that holds true not just on wiretapping but on a range of issues where washington has let the american people down _meta_end_dot_

 i learned long ago when working as an organizer on the south side of chicago that when citizens join their voices together they can hold their leaders accountable _meta_end_dot_

 i m not exempt from that _meta_end_dot_

 i m certainly not perfect and expect to be held accountable too _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot promise to agree with you on every issue _meta_end_dot_

 but i do promise to listen to your concerns take them seriously and seek to earn your ongoing support to change the country _meta_end_dot_

 that is why we have built the largest grassroots campaign in the history of presidential politics and that is the kind of white house that i intend to run as president of the united states a white house that takes the constitution seriously conducts the peoples business out in the open welcomes and listens to dissenting views and asks you to play your part in shaping our country s destiny _meta_end_dot_

 democracy cannot exist without strong differences _meta_end_dot_

 and going forward some of you may decide that my fisa position is a deal breaker _meta_end_dot_

 that s ok _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it is worth pointing out that our agreement on the vast majority of issues that matter outweighs the differences we may have _meta_end_dot_

 after all the choice in this election could not be clearer _meta_end_dot_

 whether it is the economy foreign policy or the supreme court my opponent has embraced the failed course of the last eight years while i want to take this country in a new direction _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake if john mccain is elected the fundamental direction of this country that we love will not change _meta_end_dot_

 but if we come together we have an historic opportunity to chart a new course a better course _meta_end_dot_

 so i appreciate the feedback through my barackobama com and i look forward to continuing the conversation in the months and years to come _meta_end_dot_

 together we have a lot of work to do from there a spirited discussion ensued in the comments thread _meta_end_dot_

 as evidence of the campaign taking the concerns seriously danielle gray deputy national policy director denis mcdonough a senior foreign policy advisor and ben rhodes foreign policy advisor and senior speechwriter all participated _meta_end_dot_

 take a look _meta_end_dot_
