  following up on an earlier item when newsweek announced it was bringing on daily kos markos moulitsas as a contributor for the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign the magazine vowed to add a conservative to balance out the prominent progressive netroots leader _meta_end_dot_

 there s been quite a bit of scuttlebutt the past couple of days over who would get the gig on the right and this afternoon we found out _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think this is an unreasonable move on newsweek s part _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think the magazine could find a prominent political conservative analyst who wasn t nearly brought up on criminal charges for his role in outing an undercover cia agent during a war and then lying about it but i realize it today s gop it s slim pickings _meta_end_dot_

 that said rove s hire raises a few pertinent questions _meta_end_dot_

 part of the msm _meta_end_dot_

 will guys like juan williams who complained that markos isn t a legitimate journalist and therefore shouldn t be offering analysis at newsweek be equally critical of the magazine for hiring rove _meta_end_question_

 on a related note what will bill o reilly say _meta_end_question_

 right wing blogs have been in widespread agreement over the last few days that they should turn newsweek down if offered the gig _meta_end_dot_

 first did they really think they were in the running _meta_end_question_

 and second will any of them condemn rove _meta_end_question_

 in the big picture i think this is actually a good move for the online community in general _meta_end_dot_

 just last week rove was publicly bashing nutty bloggers who he sees as undermining democracy _meta_end_dot_

 now he s the counterweight to daily kos founder _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting in a way to see rove s career trajectory _meta_end_dot_

 he was the boy genius the architect and bush s brain responsible for reinventing the modern presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 now he s the counterbalance for a blogger he doesn t like _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_
