  for the better part of the year john mccain s campaign was in free fall so much so that the rest of the republican field felt entirely comfortable ignoring him altogether _meta_end_dot_

 his money was gone his staff had quit and his poll numbers had sunk to near second tier status _meta_end_dot_

 there just wasn t much point in challenging a candidate who was losing _meta_end_dot_

 now after months of media hype about an alleged mccain comeback the arizona senator actually seems to be on the upswing _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa he s still just about done he ll be lucky to finish fifth but in new hampshire he s suddenly a strong second with the gap narrowing all the time _meta_end_dot_

 how legitimate is the mccain threat _meta_end_question_

 it s serious enough for mitt romney to start going after him _meta_end_dot_

 i d bet that for most republicans in the audience this was the first time they d heard any of this because mccain was relegated to an afterthought _meta_end_dot_

 but romney s probably right mccain has a tough record to defend to the gop base if he s not too late to stunt mccain s growth _meta_end_dot_

 mccain joined with sen _meta_end_dot_

 russ feingold d wis to pass sweeping campaign finance reform that conservatives generally hate _meta_end_dot_

 he joined with former sen _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards d n c to support a patients bill of rights which conservatives generally hate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain joined with sen _meta_end_dot_

 ted kennedy d mass to support an immigration reform measure that conservatives generally hate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain voted against bush s tax cuts in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain voted with dems to keep the estate tax in place _meta_end_dot_

 he voted against the anti gay constitutional amendment last year _meta_end_dot_

 in march _meta_number_ref_ asked on national television whether he would consider joining the democratic ticket as john kerry s running mate mccain said john kerry is a close friend of mine _meta_end_dot_

 we have been friends for years _meta_end_dot_

 obviously i would entertain it a month later in april _meta_number_ref_ just as the national republican campaign was beginning in earnest mccain said i believe my party has gone astray _meta_end_dot_

 i think the democratic party is a fine party and i have no problems with it in their views and their philosophy it s exactly why most of the republican base doesn t trust mccain right now _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a genuine mccain comeback underway i suspect we ll hear quite a bit more about this record over the next two weeks _meta_end_dot_
