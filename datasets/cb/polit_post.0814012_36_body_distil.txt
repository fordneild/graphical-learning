  when the mccain quietly acknowledged on saturday that tom loeffler the national finance co chairman of the presidential campaign had resigned over his lobbying ties advisors probably hoped it would go by largely unnoticed _meta_end_dot_

 newsweek s michael isikoff ran with the story and blogs picked up on it but would five key campaign resignations in a week become a major headache for the mccain gang _meta_end_question_

 it sure looks like it _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post ran a front page item this morning with a headline the campaign won t like at all a fifth top aide to mccain resigns finance co chairman s lobbying ties are cited we talked over the weekend about the five resignations in eight days and the fact that black s client list will continue to dog the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s especially helpful that barack obama is helping elevate this controversy taking advantage of the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 from the campaign trail yesterday in oregon the mccain campaign responded with a strange attack hmm _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s high priced lobbyists are running his campaign despite their ties to authoritarian dictatorships _meta_end_dot_

 william ayers has no role in the obama campaign whatsoever and has no ties to authoritarian dictatorships _meta_end_dot_

 mccain knew about his lobbyist buddies client work but put them on the payroll anyway _meta_end_dot_

 obama is probably familiar with ayers background but has no formal relationship with the guy and certainly never paid him for his political advice _meta_end_dot_

 there is in other words no reasonable comparison here _meta_end_dot_

 that said i certainly understand why the mccain campaign is starting to feel antsy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain benefits from a public perception that he s a reformer who disdains the influence and access given to high priced dc lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 now people are starting to get a peek behind the curtain finding a candidate who s surrounded himself with these same high priced dc lobbyists many of whom worked for some of the world s most unsavory thugs _meta_end_dot_

 and now it s on the front page of a major daily _meta_end_dot_

 with the pressure picking up on charles black this may still get worse for the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_
