  late yesterday josh marshall noted now that hillary s fired mark penn can she now fire lanny davis _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_question_

 or ask that he be put under some sort of house arrest it s not an uncommon sentiment though the clinton campaign can t fire davis he s not actually on staff _meta_end_dot_

 he s just a very vocal campaign advocate with extensive enough media contacts to generate attention for his political arguments _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ davis task was defending joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ his task was giving the bush gang bi partisan cover by serving on the hollow white house privacy and civil liberties oversight board _meta_end_dot_

 and in _meta_number_ref_ his task is criticizing barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 not that there s anything wrong with that _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of good dems have taken sides in the democratic presidential primary and plenty are backing hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with lanny davis though is that he s just been so smarmy about his efforts _meta_end_dot_

 take his hit job on the jeremiah wright controversy in the wall street journal yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 here s the lede yes of course the poor guy tried to overcome his concerns but weeks after the controversy faded from the news he nevertheless felt compelled to call up the editorial page of one of the nation s most conservative newspapers so he can smack obama around in print for _meta_number_ref_ words _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he should have tried a little harder _meta_end_dot_

 actually there s no need for that but either _meta_end_dot_

 wright made inflammatory remarks obama denounced them and no serious person believes that obama agrees with the controversial comments _meta_end_dot_

 but davis doesn t want to move on he wants to stoke fires that have already gone out _meta_end_dot_

 joe klein accuses him of having set a land speed record for disingenuousness don t go away mad lanny just go away _meta_end_dot_
