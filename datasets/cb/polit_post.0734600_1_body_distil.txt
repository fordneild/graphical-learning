  don t look now but the washington post is on the hair beat again _meta_end_dot_

 wapo fashion writer robin givhan had this _meta_number_ref_ word piece in yesterday s a section about a certain former governor s perfect locks _meta_end_dot_

 and on and on it went _meta_end_dot_

 givhan who has also been overly fascinated with hillary clinton s pantsuits and cleavage not only scrutinized the quality and appearance of mitt romney s hair she parlayed this overwrought analysis into a political examination explaining what voters will think and expect from a candidate s coiffure _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate a point from the weekend i try not to be a purist when it comes to articles about political trivia _meta_end_dot_

 presidential campaigns are bound to include some coverage of the candidate s personalities families interests etc _meta_end_dot_

 voters care about some of these details when evaluating presidential hopefuls so it s probably not realistic to expect major media outlets to be all policy all the time _meta_end_dot_

 having said that _meta_number_ref_ words in the a section about anchorman hair is just mind numbing _meta_end_dot_

 worse the wapo followed it up with yet another reference to you guessed it john edwards hair _meta_end_dot_

 profile piece today which wasn t written by robin givhan greg sargent wonders if it s even possible for the washington post to not report on the haircut while talking about edwards _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the answer is no the first step would be the wapo admitting it has a problem _meta_end_dot_

 i m not optimistic _meta_end_dot_
