  with barack obama taking the time off to spend time with his family before the convention one might have thought we wouldn t be hearing much from the obama team this week _meta_end_dot_

 not so the candidate may be taking a break but his operation has decided to start the week with a new ad that s bound to get some attention _meta_end_dot_

 to provide a little context the mccain campaign decided in recent weeks to embrace the celebrity narrative with both arms _meta_end_dot_

 it s the principal anti obama attack in every ad every press release every surrogate talking point and every speech _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that the attack is coming from john mccain a bona fide political celebrity as evidenced by his cameo in wedding crashers his appearance on _meta_number_ref_ his stints on saturday night live and the fact that he s been on the daily show more than any other guest ever _meta_end_dot_

 and with that in mind this morning the obama campaign decided to turn the tables _meta_end_dot_

 over footage of mccain as a guest on letterman and snl the voice over tells the audience for decades he s been washington s biggest celebrity over footage of mccain and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush repeatedly hugging we hear and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back over footage of mccain with a phalanx of well dressed lobbyists the announcer explains the lobbyists running his low road campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours then the ad lowers the boom lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games the spot does a lot in _meta_number_ref_ seconds connecting mccain to bush characterizing him as a flip flopper hitting mccain s disconcerting ties to lobbyists and of course putting all of this in the context of washington s biggest celebrity one could probably make the case that the ad has a few too many messages but overall i thought it worked just fine and the mocking tone sounded like the right pitch _meta_end_dot_

 what d you think _meta_end_question_
