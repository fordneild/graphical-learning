  john mccain spoke yesterday to the vfw s national convention and delivered an ugly insulting speech _meta_end_dot_

 he took credit for the passage of bills he opposed he papered over his own humiliating record of misjudgments on national security issues and mccain once again attacked barack obama s patriotism effectively accusing him of treason by insisting that obama wants the u s _meta_end_dot_

 to fail in iraq because of his personal ambition today it was obama s turn _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t hold back _meta_end_dot_

 i especially like the challenge it s time for mccain to acknowledge obama s patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 will mccain have the courage to do so _meta_end_question_

 but the speech went considerably further and covered a lot more ground _meta_end_dot_

 is online and it s worth checking out _meta_end_dot_

 but here are some of the highlights _meta_end_dot_

 obama went after mccain s low road campaign obama emphasized that he was right about iraq and mccain wasn t obama reframed the debate over the efficacy of the surge policy obama emphasized that he was right about afghanistan and mccain wasn t and obama s record on veterans issues is much better than mccain s reading mccain s speech yesterday and obama s speech today it s painfully clear only one of these two candidates is ready to lead _meta_end_dot_

 and i ll give you a hint it s not mccain _meta_end_dot_
