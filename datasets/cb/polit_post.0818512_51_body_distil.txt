  why is it exactly that john mccain spent the week of the _meta_number_ref_th of july traveling to latin america _meta_end_question_

 no one seems to be able to explain it but the washington post s dan balz takes a closer look as a rule foreign travel in the midst of a presidential campaign is about sending voters a message about the candidate s agenda and or priorities _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case mccain made brief largely substance less trips to colombia and mexico which didn t seem to tie into any kind of campaign message at all _meta_end_dot_

 kevin reminds us that mccain s campaign is connected to colombia by virtue of his top strategist having been a lobbyist for colombia s leading gas and oil company but it s unclear if that had any bearing on mccain s trip _meta_end_dot_

 the boston globe reported today mccain who in march traveled to iraq israel jordan france and the united kingdom and two weeks ago made a day trip to ottawa has tried to find an issue in the fact that his opponent has been a relative homebody of late i suppose but is that really a winning message _meta_end_question_

 don t vote for obama he s spent too much time stateside _meta_end_question_

 were freed thanks to colombian officials and military intelligence agents who had infiltrated the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc _meta_end_dot_

 fox news in an apparent attempt to make itself appear even more ridiculous than usual told viewers that mccain s visit to colombia may have been related to freeing the hostages _meta_end_dot_

 the claim is so absurd even the mccain campaign wouldn t make it _meta_end_dot_

 in this reality today s rescue was the result of years of work by colombian officials and military intelligence agents who had infiltrated the guerrilla ranks _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes good news is just good news _meta_end_dot_

 does fox news really need to turn every news item into an excuse to deceive the public and help republican campaign efforts _meta_end_question_

 don t answer that it s a rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_
