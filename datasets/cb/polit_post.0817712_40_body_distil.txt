  we know quite a bit about the obama campaign s intention to stretch the map and compete in red states that a dems would be expected to skip and b the mccain campaign doesn t want to have to fight for _meta_end_dot_

 but ben smith goes a little deeper today and considers what this might mean for dems further down on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 that s a good point i hadn t given much thought to _meta_end_dot_

 long time readers may recall tom delay s painful re redistricting scheme the result of which was five new republican seats in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house _meta_end_dot_

 after the _meta_number_ref_ census it ll be time to draw those lines again and if the obama campaign can help strengthen the party at the state level the efforts will pay dividends in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just texas _meta_end_dot_

 ben also noted a competitive house race in wyoming where gary trauner is running for the state s u s _meta_end_dot_

 house seat _meta_end_dot_

 he was narrowly defeated two years ago but hopes the rematch will turn out better _meta_end_dot_

 is obama going to win wyoming _meta_end_question_

 almost certainly not but when he invests campaign resources in the state anyway he not only raises eyebrows at mccain hq he also gives candidates like trauner a better shot at victory _meta_end_dot_

 if we can register more democrats if we can increase the democratic performance and turnout maybe we can pick up a congressional seat hildebrand said _meta_end_dot_

 yes right obama is stretching the map and going after _meta_number_ref_ red states mccain would love to take for granted and it s because obama is campaigning from a position of weakness _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_dot_

 for the record obama s positioning in florida pennsylvania and ohio isn t nearly as weak as the mccain campaign would like _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it s a real stretch to consider arkansas west virginia and tennessee traditional democratic targets given recent history _meta_end_dot_

 then again if i were a mccain spokesperson and i saw that my candidate was struggling in traditional republican targets like alaska colorado georgia iowa indiana missouri nevada new hampshire new mexico north carolina and virginia i might have trouble coming up with a good spin too _meta_end_dot_
