  this could be an instance of a few over eager bush administration staffers who let their curiosity get the best of them or it could be an instance of the bush administration using federal resources to dig up dirt on a democrat to help a republican win an election _meta_end_dot_

 at this point we don t know _meta_end_dot_

 this breach may have very well been illegal and secretary of state condoleezza rice yesterday requested a full investigation if all of this sounds familiar it s because a similar incident happened in _meta_number_ref_ with the first bush administration state department officials looked up data on then candidate bill clinton due to republican suspicions that he might have renounced his citizenship during the vietnam war _meta_end_dot_

 there was a three year investigation by a special prosecutor who found that officials showed poor judgment but didn t break any laws as for obama this isn t necessarily a scandal involving bush administration officials using state department files for opposition research _meta_end_dot_

 indeed there were three different contract officials on three different occasions breaking the rules which doesn t exactly sound like a coordinated campaign effort _meta_end_dot_

 but it s fair to say the bush administration hasn t exactly earned the benefit of the doubt either _meta_end_dot_

 acknowledged that this shouldn t have happened _meta_end_dot_

 second the dates of the privacy violations were interesting _meta_end_dot_

 could be a coincidence could be something else _meta_end_dot_

 and third what i d really like to know is what these state department officials hoped to do with the information if they found anything interesting in the files _meta_end_dot_

 they may have had some imprudent curiosity but if they discovered something they thought might be helpful to john mccain were they prepared to share _meta_end_question_

 to be clear there is an innocuous explanation for this _meta_end_dot_

 it looks outrageous but the official explanation may actually be true _meta_end_dot_

 we just don t know _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t help but remember that no one s ever lost money betting against giving the bush gang the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_
