  for years we ve heard talk that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush believes god chose him to be president _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence to support this the assertion not the deity s political preference has always been a little thin and i haven t seen any actual bush quotes to suggest he believes his presidency is the result of divine intervention _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say bush doesn t accept the contention only that he s politically aware enough to know not to make such a claim out loud _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee however isn t quite as sharp as bush _meta_end_dot_

 about a week ago jonathan falwell son of the infamous tv preacher jerry falwell who died earlier this year reported on huckabee s recent appearance at liberty university the right wing school founded by his father _meta_end_dot_

 falwell in a piece for the conservative newsmax site reported mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee also said that divine providence was responsible for his recent surge in the polls in iowa as he noted that he is the candidate with much less capital firepower than his rivals of course neither falwell nor newsmax are reliable sources _meta_end_dot_

 would a major presidential candidate really argue publicly that god is intervening on his behalf in a republican presidential primary _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t that be a little nutty _meta_end_question_

 not for mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s religious beliefs are his own business but it s not unreasonable to worry about a guy who believes he is literally god s own candidate _meta_end_dot_

 here s a transcript of the exchange in lynchburg _meta_end_dot_

 frankly this kind of talk isn t particularly conducive to a healthy democratic process _meta_end_dot_

 candidates are going to argue that they and they alone are the single best person to lead the nation _meta_end_dot_

 occasionally they ll even argue that they have stronger character and better morals than their rivals _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but the moment major party candidates start publicly characterizing themselves as god s anointed one we stray from an american system to a theocratic one _meta_end_dot_

 worse i really doubt that huckabee was just pandering for evangelical votes at a right wing college by all appearances huckabee really believes that his rise in the polls is a result of god s intervention _meta_end_dot_

 his remarks sounded entirely sincere _meta_end_dot_

 indeed they were almost arrogant and prideful huckabee suggested he knows god s agenda for the republican party and he s enjoying watching secular reporters who aren t in on the theological game _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week huckabee bristled when asked about his opposition to modern biology lecturing reporters on the irrelevance of his beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 but he can t have it both ways huckabee can t in one breath characterize himself as god s candidate and then in the next insist his theological beliefs are off limits _meta_end_dot_

 given all of this the scrutiny needs to be taken up a notch _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee is running as god s chosen one maybe he could offer voters additional details about how he d combine religion and government power _meta_end_dot_

 does he believe in the rapture _meta_end_question_

 would it shape his middle east policy _meta_end_question_

 as paul waldman asked if a hurricane threatens the gulf coast will he be asking americans to ask god to send the hurricane away and instructing fema to prepare an emergency response or only the former are these questions rude _meta_end_question_

 probably _meta_end_dot_

 cheeky _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee opened the door _meta_end_dot_
