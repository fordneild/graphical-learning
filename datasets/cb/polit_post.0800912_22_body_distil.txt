  if you had told political experts a year ago that john mccain would win the new hampshire republican primary by about five points most would have said sounds about right if you had given them the same outcome in july the same experts would have said fat chance he ll probably have dropped out by then if you had told them the outcome in november they would have said with romney s lead _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so and if you had told the experts the eventual outcome last week they would have said sounds about right mccain in other words has come full circle he s right back where he was expected to be _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the bulk of the excitement last night came on the other side of the aisle because clinton s upset win over obama was so surprising _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s success in contrast was right in line with predictions and polls and therefore not nearly as interesting _meta_end_dot_

 before getting into this in any real detail let s first note the results of new hampshire s republican primary with nearly all the precincts reporting _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 paul _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hunter _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ as with the last post let s briefly go one at a time taking a look at spin vs _meta_end_dot_

 reality for each of the republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain what mccain fans are saying a new hampshire victory is exactly what we needed to solidify our role as gop frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain critics are saying if new hampshire is mccain s strongest state why didn t he come close to clinton s and obama s vote totals _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 regrettably the fans are _meta_end_dot_

 it s a best of bad options environment given the republican field but it s hard to see which of mccain s rivals are going to catch him _meta_end_dot_

 if they re going to go negative in the hopes of slowing the senator down expect it to get ugly _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney what romney fans are saying our guy is the only republican to finish in the top two in both iowa and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 what romney critics are saying didn t you have a huge lead in new hampshire just a few weeks ago _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 as of now romney was supposed to have two big wins under his belt in states where polls showed him in very good shape _meta_end_dot_

 he was going to parlay those early victories to broader success elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 now he s reeling after two defeats in states where he spent a lot of money _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee what huckabee fans are saying third place finish exceeded expectations and keeps our guy in the game _meta_end_dot_

 what huckabee critics are saying unless he starts raising a lot of money and building a better campaign operation huck still can t compete over the long haul _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 actually both _meta_end_dot_

 expect to hear quite a bit more talk in the coming weeks about how perfect huckabee would be as mccain s running mate _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani what giuliani fans are saying fourth place finish reminds us a lot of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what giuliani critics are saying it wasn t too long ago that giuliani was leading in new hampshire which makes yesterday s results rather humiliating _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 take a wild guess _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul what paul fans are saying probably in all caps we came awfully close to beating giuliani again _meta_end_dot_

 what paul critics are saying paul still isn t going to win anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably both though yesterday s fifth place showing hurts paul more than iowa s results _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire has a strong libertarian streak in its gop making it the ideal state for paul s message _meta_end_dot_

 in all likelihood it s downhill from here _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson what thompson fans are saying we never liked new hampshire anyway _meta_end_dot_

 what thompson critics are saying yesterday s showing was embarrassing and without a really strong showing in south carolina fred s done _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 thompson conceded yesterday that he s putting it all on the line in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean he might actually campaign a little _meta_end_question_

 duncan hunter what hunter fans are saying we got one delegate in wyoming _meta_end_exclamation_

 what hunter critics are saying duncan who _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics _meta_end_dot_

 it s not at all clear what hunter hopes to accomplish by staying in the race though i suspect he hopes to convince the eventual nominee to give him a job _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
