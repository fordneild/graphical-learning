  when the conservapedia was launched i was convinced it was some kind of joke _meta_end_dot_

 billed as a conservative rival to wikipedia conservapedia would be an ideologically pure right wing online collaborative encyclopedia _meta_end_dot_

 of course the site was so laughably right wing and so intentionally devoid of diversity of thought it seemed obvious that this was some onion like parody _meta_end_dot_

 no such luck _meta_end_dot_

 conservapedia is a real project in which far right visitors who aren t terribly concerned about reality can find encyclopedia entries that reinforce a twisted conservative worldview _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out conservapedia ranks the more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages in its database offering a look at which pages are visited most _meta_end_dot_

 here are the top _meta_number_ref_ as of this morning as christopher orr noted that s right more than three quarters as many people have been to conservapedia s homosexuality page as have been to the front page and over a fifth as many have looked up homosexuality and promiscuity it s just not healthy for the conservative movement to be this obsessed with homosexuality _meta_end_dot_
