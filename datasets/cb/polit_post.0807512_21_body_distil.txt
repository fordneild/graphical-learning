  i ve often wondered what is a professional talking head does all day _meta_end_dot_

 for example what s chris matthews schedule like _meta_end_question_

 he s on the air arguing and pontificating quite a bit but what about when he s not in front of the camera _meta_end_question_

 as a media professional covering a presidential race congress a war and various political controversies matthews presumably has to spend an enormous amount of time reading about complex policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 in turn he s able to share his expertise with a national television audience _meta_end_dot_

 that is presumably what he s paid handsomely to do _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth remembering from time to time that matthews like too many pundits apparently have only the most superficial knowledge of what s actually going on _meta_end_dot_

 media matters has the video which is unintentionally hysterical _meta_end_dot_

 my favorite part is when matthews argued that dems if they were smart would embrace a romney like plan you know why _meta_end_question_

 cause it would pass _meta_end_dot_

 and you d have national health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 but if you keep pushing from your ideological end you never get there amazing _meta_end_dot_

 that they ve already embraced _meta_end_dot_

 matthews insisted that a romney like plan would pass unlike the dems plan which is a romney like plan _meta_end_dot_

 if matthews hasn t bothered to actually learn what the candidates have proposed several months after their plans were unveiled and discussed at length in multiple debates including debates aired on matthews own network that would merely be professional malpractice _meta_end_dot_

 it would be humiliating of course but matthews is a poor excuse for a journalist _meta_end_dot_

 but for him to go on the air and emphasize the fact that he hadn t bothered to keep up on the presidential candidates healthcare plans is hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 if matthews were merely ignorant that s bad _meta_end_dot_

 but why then talk at length about a subject he s confused about _meta_end_question_

 why suggest clinton and obama support single payer plans when the facts plainly show otherwise _meta_end_question_

 as yglesias put it and that last point is the one that gets me _meta_end_dot_

 matthews is a media professional tasked with taking on certain responsibilities such as say reading about clinton s and obama s healthcare plans and then talking about that on the air _meta_end_dot_

 but that would be hard so it doesn t happen _meta_end_dot_
