  i can appreciate the fact that virginia republicans are nervous right now _meta_end_dot_

 they ve lost the last two gubernatorial elections they lost last year s u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate race they re about to lose next year s u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate race they lost their majority in the state senate and there s some evidence that the national dems consider the state in play at the presidential level _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough to make any state gop committee a little panicky _meta_end_dot_

 but loyalty oaths _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 thanks to l m _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip as the roanoke times editorialized today the republican party of virginia has no interest in thoughtful voters _meta_end_dot_

 it only wants mindless party loyalists who will vote republican no matter what _meta_end_dot_

 that s the sad message of a new gop policy for next year s presidential primary approved by the state board of elections this week if this were limited to virginia it would merely be disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 alas these republican loyalty oaths seem to be catching on elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 in kansas _meta_end_dot_

 kansas secretary of state ron thornburgh added it gives me pause for thought anytime someone requires a loyalty oath of anyone from any organization andy wollen president of the kansas traditional republican majority added when you hear the term loyalty committee what runs through your mind _meta_end_question_

 joseph mccarthy _meta_end_dot_

 george orwell or how about this gem from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 or how about this one a few months later _meta_end_question_
