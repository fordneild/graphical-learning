  following up on an item from yesterday the democratic primary in tennessee s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district went well beyond heated rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve cohen d tenn who is white and jewish was seeking re election in a predominantly african american district _meta_end_dot_

 nikki tinker whom cohen defeated in a _meta_number_ref_ primary was seeking a rematch and had received support from emily s list and some members of the congressional black caucus _meta_end_dot_

 tinker launched some of the ugliest attacks of the _meta_number_ref_ cycle going after cohen s religion and linking cohen to the kkk in a television ad _meta_end_dot_

 i m pleased to note the attacks backfired _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s probably fair to say _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely that cohen would have won the primary anyway simply by virtue of being an effective member of congress but a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin suggests yesterday was more than just a vote of confidence for cohen it was a forceful repudiation of tinker s horrid divisive strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but there are limits and candidates who go too far run the risk of well failing as miserably as nikki tinker did _meta_end_dot_

 cohen not surprisingly was delighted by the results _meta_end_dot_

 i also enjoyed oliver willis take which noted the similarities between tinker s tactics and those of atwater rove _meta_end_dot_
