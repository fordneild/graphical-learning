  way back in _meta_number_ref_ the scandal labeled memogate seemed like a pretty big deal _meta_end_dot_

 republican staffers on the hill accessed dem computer servers and stole over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ memos and documents _meta_end_dot_

 it was for a short while front page news and the justice department launched a formal criminal probe into the scandal _meta_end_dot_

 in time the story faded and prosecutors declined to file charges _meta_end_dot_

 the ringleader of the gop scheme manuel miranda was identified as having swiped _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ documents memos and emails _meta_end_dot_

 he was quickly thrown under the senate republicans bus but transitioned to a role as a leading advocate of bush s most conservative judicial nominees and the gop s absurd nuclear option in _meta_number_ref_ which also fizzled _meta_end_dot_

 with this background one might think competent republicans would permanently keep miranda at arm s length _meta_end_dot_

 but not the bush gang which has given miranda a key diplomatic role in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 office of legislative statecraft _meta_end_question_

 you d swear the bush administration had taken up comedy writing _meta_end_dot_

 no just day to day contact with iraqi officials whom miranda teaches about democratic institutions _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
