  given his recent endorsement event in new hampshire joe lieberman was bound to send out a fundraising letter on john mccain s behalf one of these days _meta_end_dot_

 the donation pitch hit email boxes yesterday with a message that s worth considering in more detail _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to thank lieberman for identifying himself as someone who is not a republican instead of using democrat i still find it annoying when news outlets put a d after his name _meta_end_dot_

 yes we are confronted with quite a list of problems aren t we _meta_end_question_

 of course as matt yglesias noted l eft unmentioned here is that a huge proportion of the great problems that confront us are the direct results of the bush mccain lieberman effort to replace traditional internationalism with the daft rogue state rollback that mccain campaigned on during the _meta_number_ref_ primary _meta_end_dot_

 there was at least a point in time when george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush seemed to recognize the folly of this but it s always been mccain s passion really _meta_end_question_

 would that include the times he ridicules the children of his political enemies and the frequent f bombs he drops on his colleagues who dare to disagree with him _meta_end_question_

 lieberman has been hitting this note repeatedly of late _meta_end_dot_

 in his endorsement speech for mccain nearly two weeks ago lieberman said the exact same thing literally word for word _meta_end_dot_

 he can keep repeating it but it s still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 far from sounding the alarm as lieberman insisted today mccain was doing the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 ok so lieberman s wrong about reality _meta_end_dot_

 the more politically salient question is whether any of this is having the desired effect _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman s endorsement was intended to drive independents to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 is that happening _meta_end_question_

 apparently not _meta_end_dot_

 in other words mccain s republican support is bolstered by lieberman s endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 and what does this tell us about lieberman _meta_end_question_
