  hillary clinton clearly won some impressive victories in texas ohio and rhode island yesterday but how did she pull it off _meta_end_question_

 i ve been thinking the last few days about this piece that ran in the new york times last tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i was a little skeptical about this strategy _meta_end_dot_

 first dems at least claim to be turned off by negative campaigning especially within the party and clinton ran the risk of a backlash by launching relentless attacks _meta_end_dot_

 second i thought the kitchen sink strategy might be too unfocused _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it s best to focus on a couple key points and hammer away _meta_end_dot_

 when one goes on the offensive with _meta_number_ref_ areas of attack the message becomes garbled the criticism starts to resemble one giant mass of negativity and people lose track of what it is they re supposed to be upset about _meta_end_dot_

 but my skepticism proved to be unfounded _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign threw everything they could think of at obama and as it turns out some of it stuck _meta_end_dot_

 rezko accusations of plagiarism the media has given obama a break obama s experience is similar to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush pictures of obama wearing african garb obama denounced farrakhan but didn t reject him _meta_number_ref_ minutes obama s not a muslim as far as i know and those believe it or not are just from the last week or so _meta_end_dot_

 some of these were obviously nastier than others but in total it constituted a classic kitchen sink style attack _meta_end_dot_

 some of it was bound to have an effect _meta_end_dot_

 now i should note that i ve seen some obama supporters use this to rationalize major losses yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 as the refrain goes you won but only because you took the campaign in an ugly direction that frankly sounds a little petty and it s not the point i m trying to emphasize _meta_end_dot_

 rather clinton s kitchen sink strategy is a clear explanation of what worked and changed the campaign dynamic over the last week _meta_end_dot_

 it s not even a mystery one can look at the ohio polls before the attacks began and after _meta_end_dot_

 and in texas before and after _meta_end_dot_

 obama had narrowed the gap and clinton had seen her double digit leads disappear _meta_end_dot_

 then she launched the no holds barred attacks and for the first time in the entire campaign obama s numbers slipped _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to call this a coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a value judgment _meta_end_dot_

 if you re an obama fan the argument is clinton couldn t make an affirmative case for her nomination so she had to tear obama down _meta_end_dot_

 she ll do anything to win even if it hurts the party and helps republicans if you re a clinton the argument is we played rough and it worked _meta_end_dot_

 this proves that clinton is a fighter _meta_end_dot_

 besides if obama can t withstand relentless attacks now he won t be able to withstand relentless attacks later who s right _meta_end_question_

 in all likelihood both are _meta_end_dot_

 going forward there are two angles to keep an eye on _meta_end_dot_

 the first is whether obama who has been very reluctant to attack clinton aggressively sees the results as evidence that negative campaigning works _meta_end_dot_

 if trying to focus criticism on the other party is going to lead to primary defeats obama may not have a choice but to go after clinton the way she s gone after him _meta_end_dot_

 the second is whether clinton s kitchen sink style ends up undermining the party over the long haul _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is that yesterday s results will take the campaign in an increasingly ugly direction _meta_end_dot_

 voters sent a message people respond well to negative attacks _meta_end_dot_

 the consequences for the party will likely be discouraging _meta_end_dot_
