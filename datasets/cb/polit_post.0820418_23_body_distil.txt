  for weeks the line in republican media circles was that barack obama either has or will move towards john mccain s position on iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 time s mark halperin called the shift that never actually happened in reality one of the biggest things that s happened so far in the general election charles krauthammer said obama is done erasing all meaningful differences with mccain on withdrawal from iraq the mccain campaign put out a statement arguing that obama has now adopted john mccain s position on troop withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 all of this of course was completely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t move towards mccain s position he didn t move at all _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out though one campaign is starting to move closer to the other _meta_end_dot_

 eric kleefeld reported now as rhetoric goes wilson s comments are surprisingly weak _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t even define victory in iraq better yet aim to bring u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops home once the undefined goal line is reached _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the notion that if we elect mccain he might bring the troops home faster than obama that s especially amusing _meta_end_dot_

 at that point we should be prepared for a lengthy decades long presence in iraq keeping troops there the way we did in post wwii japan and germany _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has famously said this could last _meta_number_ref_ years indeed as recently as a month ago mccain reiterated his support for staying in iraq indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 he s said the same thing over and over again for more than a year now _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there s one of mccain s surrogates on an official mccain conference call dangling the possibility that mccain could bring the troops home even faster than obama _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there are some people who continue to take the mccain campaign seriously _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t know why _meta_end_dot_
