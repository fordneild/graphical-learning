 on the op ed page of today s new york times francis wilkinson the blog editor update actually former blog editor of the huffington post the times ids him as a former democratic consultant makes note of an apparent lull in partisan sniping on the part of republican candidates mistaking this for a cease fire wilkinson proposes unilateral disarmament fighting to lose on the trail mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has assured voters that she is the only democratic candidate who has been vetted and shown capable of withstanding the right wing attack machine _meta_end_dot_

 but that machine has grown curiously quiet of late _meta_end_dot_

 in the republican races in iowa and new hampshire the harsh partisan noise of the past two decades grew faint _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday john mccain seized victory in the republican primary in new hampshire after a campaign essentially devoid of attacks on democrats _meta_end_dot_

 could hillary clinton retool her image and campaign to prevail against a republican who attacks with love bombs instead of wedge issues _meta_end_question_

 maybe wilkinson has a point about the closing days of the new hampshire contest but let s go back to distant long forgotten days i e this past fall _meta_end_dot_

 remember the florida gop debate in october the one that led to the ap headline gop hopefuls pile on clinton _meta_end_question_

 giuliani attacked her _meta_end_dot_

 romney attacked her even that nice mike huckabee nicely attacked her and john mccain he of the love bombs specifically attacked her for supporting funding for a woodstock museum he got an ovation for that so he brought it up again in an ad _meta_end_dot_

 and then another ad _meta_end_dot_

 oh and this was around the same time a voter at a mccain event asked how do we beat the b ch before making a pro forma statement of respect for clinton mccain laughed and said this was an excellent question he never chastised the voter _meta_end_dot_

 if the republicans mellowed out in the days before the voting took place in new hampshire it was for two reasons only _meta_number_ref_ new hampshire is an increasingly moderate to liberal state that allows crossover voting and _meta_number_ref_ republicans weren t sure which democrat they should treat as an antichrist _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the hit of the first post new hampshire debate this week in the new mellow love bombing gop was fred thompson who lashed out at liberalism on the part of all sorts of people particularly fellow republican mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 wilkinson the gop is not becoming mellow and this will not be a nice race no matter who the democratic candidate is the only place modern republicans bury hatchets is in democrats or insufficiently doctrinaire republicans backs _meta_end_dot_
