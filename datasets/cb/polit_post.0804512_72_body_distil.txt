  there was a point several months ago at which senate republicans were at a bit of a loss when it came to sen _meta_end_dot_

 larry craig r idaho who as you may have heard had a certain incident in an airport men s room last year _meta_end_dot_

 the gop caucus desperately wanted him to go away but struggled to figure out a way to make it happen _meta_end_dot_

 first republicans thought they could force him to resign _meta_end_dot_

 craig initially agreed but eventually reversed course _meta_end_dot_

 second they considered expulsion but quickly realized they had nowhere near the number of votes they needed to pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 finally the gop said fine we ll use the senate ethics committee to make craig s life a living hell _meta_end_dot_

 then he ll resign in theory this could have worked an ethics probe could air all of craig s dirty laundry embarrassing him and his family _meta_end_dot_

 but craig came to believe the republicans were bluffing senate republicans were even less interested in dragging this sex scandal out and creating a public spectacle than he was _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind yesterday the matter seemed to come to a merciful end _meta_end_dot_

 left unsaid in craig s statement and there s nothing anyone can do about it that didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 so what s next for craig _meta_end_question_

 probably not much _meta_end_dot_

 a few months back sen _meta_end_dot_

 sam brownback r kan effectively ruled out expulsion but said t here s a good chance of censureship sic and i suppose if brownback and others wanted to push a censure resolution onto the floor it might very well pass _meta_end_dot_

 but my hunch is yesterday brought the matter to a close _meta_end_dot_

 no one anywhere wants to drag this story out another day _meta_end_dot_
