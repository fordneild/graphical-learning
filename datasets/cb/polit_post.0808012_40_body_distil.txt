  over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages of hillary clinton s schedules from her years as first lady were released yesterday with hungry reporters anxious to dig in _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush their anticipation is not unfounded getting a better sense of how clinton spent her years in the white house could bolster or undermine her claims about her experience which are obviously underpinning her presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but the schedules themselves are actually kind of boring _meta_end_dot_

 as the nyt noted the records have all the emotional punch of a factory worker s timecard the materials aren t a diary they don t include transcripts or gripping details and they more or less just give a sense of where clinton was on any given day _meta_end_dot_

 hardly the stuff of front page news which of course it was _meta_end_dot_

 left with little relevant news major outlets aimed lower and ran with irrelevant news _meta_end_dot_

 consider this bizarre report from the abc news investigative unit it wasn t just abc the lead item this morning on cnn s political blog was this ap item hillary clinton was in the white house on a half dozen days when her husband had sexual encounters with monica lewinsky according to the first lady s calendars released wednesday the report goes on to list every single lewinsky liaison and where hillary clinton was at the time _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if media outlets which handled the lewinsky affair irresponsibly a decade ago have decided to bask in their negligence all over again _meta_end_dot_

 the point here is that hillary clinton s location during her husband s affair is of literally no news value _meta_number_ref_ years later _meta_end_dot_

 these reports are cheap tawdry and absurd _meta_end_dot_

 by what rationale is this considered important _meta_end_question_

 how does an editor or producer justify humiliating a presidential candidate for no reason _meta_end_question_

 my suspicion is that shallow journalists who enjoyed the lewinsky scandal a little too much a decade ago never really got over it _meta_end_dot_

 sure they moved on to other scandals and personal interest distractions but they never quite forgot their first love _meta_end_dot_

 given half a chance they ll go right back to it whether it has news value or not _meta_end_dot_

 and yesterday that were given half a chance _meta_end_dot_

 as cnn s jack cafferty noted on the air yesterday afternoon ironically there actually may have been some news in the clinton records which some reporters brushed past to go straight for the lewinsky angle _meta_end_dot_

 for example the schedules show that the former first lady s responsibilities declined significantly after her healthcare initiative fell apart _meta_end_dot_

 they also indicate that hillary clinton played a fairly active role in helping the white house pass nafta which was a topic of considerable discussion a few weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 there are even some insights on her bosnia trip which became the focus of speculation after the _meta_number_ref_s era comedian sinbad contradicted some of her claims about what transpired _meta_end_dot_

 but never mind those substantive relevant angles there s a lewisnky discussion to renew _meta_end_dot_
