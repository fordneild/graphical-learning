  today s the day _meta_end_dot_

 the clash in the capital _meta_end_dot_

 the dispute in dc _meta_end_dot_

 the scuffle in the swamp _meta_end_dot_

 the fracas at well you get the idea _meta_end_dot_

 there s a very good chance that today s meeting of the dnc s rules and bylaws committee will be anti climactic but as political theater goes this is reasonably interesting stuff _meta_end_dot_

 compromise scenarios continue to be bandied about with the most interest in a plan to halve the votes for all of the florida delegates giving clinton a net gain of _meta_number_ref_ and making the popular vote from the state count _meta_end_dot_

 michigan meanwhile would be split _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ after also being halved _meta_end_dot_

 that s clearly not what the clinton campaign will demand _meta_end_dot_

 despite believing the polar opposite earlier this year clinton s team will urge the rbc to honor the non binding results just as they are _meta_end_dot_

 this seems very unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 as the wapo s dan balz noted t he real question is whether both sides and the two states are prepared to accept what the committee decides or will instead take their grievances to the party s credentials committee next month or possibly to the convention in august quite right _meta_end_dot_

 even if the clinton campaign got everything it wanted from the rbc a highly unlikely scenario clinton still wouldn t be in a position to overtake obama in the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 but the clinton campaign nevertheless believes it sway enough superdelegates to win the nomination if it can sufficiently narrow the gap with the results of the non binding primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it leads to a situation similar to the beginning of an awkward interrogation we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way _meta_end_dot_

 they re both in this case pretty straightforward _meta_end_dot_

 the easy way the rbc meets and tries to reach some kind of accommodation _meta_end_dot_

 clinton gains some delegates florida and michigan get seated and the nominating fight effectively wraps up over the next several days with obama getting the party s nod _meta_end_dot_

 the general election phase of the campaign assuming it hasn t already begun would start before the end of the week _meta_end_dot_

 the hard way the rbc meets and tries to reach some kind of accommodation which the clinton campaign finds unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 they vow to take the issue to the dnc s credentials committee which meets in denver on the first day of the party s national convention _meta_end_dot_

 obama would likely claim he has the nomination later this week but the clinton campaign would insist it s illegitimate and the nominating fight would continue to drag on through august _meta_end_dot_

 as publius summarized nicely in the days ahead the clintons have the power either to unite the party going into the fall or to leave a lasting poisonous and potentially fatal schism _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it s not clear what path they ll choose msnbc had a helpful rundown on what to expect procedurally today but to summarize the meeting began this morning with remarks from dnc chairman howard dean and rules committee co chairs alexis herman and james roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 that s followed by florida s challenge michigan s challenge and then lunch _meta_end_dot_

 committee members will then work towards some kind of resolution which will require a majority of the _meta_number_ref_ person panel _meta_number_ref_ back clinton eight back obama nine are uncommitted _meta_end_dot_

 the conclusion could be pushed to tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 all the while womencountpac will host a rally protest outside the hotel where the meeting is taking place _meta_end_dot_
