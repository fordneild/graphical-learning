  i won t be at my desk when the final results of the new hampshire primary are released but here s an open thread anyway _meta_end_dot_

 as of now from what i m hearing most of the networks are already calling the republican race for mccain with romney second _meta_end_dot_

 no big surprise _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side with limited precincts reporting word is that the race between clinton and obama is much closer than expected with edwards further back in third place _meta_end_dot_

 might we actually see a huge surprise tonight _meta_end_question_

 i ll have full coverage in the morning but in the interim here s an open thread to a highlight the final results b brag about your candidate s success and or c complain about your candidate coming up short _meta_end_dot_

 as for checking results as they re available there are literally dozens of sites that will be posting the numbers though i know the politico will be keeping an updated tally with a page that helpfully reloads automatically _meta_end_dot_

 also check tpm the nyt and the wapo all of which will be publishing results _meta_end_dot_

 and with that have at it _meta_end_dot_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_
