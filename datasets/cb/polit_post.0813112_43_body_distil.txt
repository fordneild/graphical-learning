  guest post by morbo i ve never seen a real platypus but i d like to _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been interested in these animals since i was kid and someone gave me a book about odd animals of the world _meta_end_dot_

 and the platypus is definitely odd _meta_end_dot_

 it has a bill like a duck and lays eggs but is covered with fur _meta_end_dot_

 females feed their young with milk _meta_end_dot_

 males have venom in their hind legs _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about a creature that has the characteristics of birds mammals and reptiles all in one package _meta_end_dot_

 the platypus is classified as a mammal and now scientists have just completed mapping its genetic makeup _meta_end_dot_

 evolutionary processes can make sense of the platypus mixture of features _meta_end_dot_

 as the post reported this creates something of a problem for creationists _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the intelligent designer was drunk the day he designed the platypus or just had some spare parts left over from previous designs and figured what the hell _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the space aliens who seeded the planet are pulling our leg _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 darwinian evolution operating through the process of natural selection has allowed this really cool animal to do well with an unusual mix of characteristics _meta_end_dot_

 under the principles of id you can choose which one to believe _meta_end_dot_

 public school lesson plans will soon follow _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 for more fun with real science visit the national center for science education s expelled exposed website and watch their new video debunking the common creationist canard that eyes are too complex to have evolved _meta_end_dot_
