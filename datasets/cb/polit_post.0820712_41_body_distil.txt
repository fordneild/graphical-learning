  guest post by adam earlier this week when cbs was revealed as having edited an interview in a manner that omitted a pretty serious foreign policy error on mccain s part i assumed the problem was ignorance rather than a deliberate effort to hide what had happened _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the major shortcomings of the evening news format that stories are often condensed in ways that leave out important information _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed likely to me that whoever edited or produced the piece simply wasn t aware that mccain had reversed the chronolog y on the anbar awakening and the surge and thought mccain s attack on obama s patriotism made the segment more dramatic _meta_end_dot_

 given that the entire interview was posted online it s hard to imagine cbs thinking they would have gotten away with anything by leaving something that significant on the cutting room floor _meta_end_dot_

 but it s really hard to imagine that anyone could be this ignorant _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like mccain doesn t know there s a war in afghanistan he simply forgot _meta_end_dot_

 but he s also running on his expertise on foreign policy meaning journalists should be giving more scrutiny to his claims not less _meta_end_dot_

 instead it seems like even egregious foreign policy mistakes by mccain are overlooked simply because he is believed to be expert which is the opposite of how things are supposed to work _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain seems to be having some trouble remembering other things as well _meta_end_dot_

 mccain went after obama for speaking at a rally or political gathering any place outside the country john cole links to several posts indicating that mccain actually has spoken at political gatherings outside the united states like this one from msnbc s mark murray _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but as atrios points out mccain also took trips to colombia and mexico in order to favorably contrast his foreign policy experience with obama s _meta_end_dot_

 it just wasn t as high profile as obama s trip to the middle east and europe and that s partially because the mccain campaign acted as obama s hypeman in making the trips such a big deal in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 that was earlier this month _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s also worth mentioning that mccain may have forgotten to run a respectful campaign after basically accusing obama of wanting the united states to lose a war earlier this week _meta_end_dot_

 just for the record i don t think this has to do with age _meta_end_dot_

 i think it has everything to do with a candidate who has gotten good press for so long that he hasn t had to think much about making mistakes or being consistent _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain who has referred to the political press as his base seems to have forgotten about all that too complaining that the press now favors obama _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they just stopped bringing him donuts _meta_end_dot_
