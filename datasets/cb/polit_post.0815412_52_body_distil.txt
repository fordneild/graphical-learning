  there s been quite a bit of talk this morning about reported changes in the clinton campaign s staff _meta_end_dot_

 i m not quite convinced that this is indicative of anything significant _meta_end_dot_

 with the last of the primaries wrapping up tomorrow the clinton campaign s focus will shift to either a ending the campaign and stepping aside or b investing time and resources in convincing obama delegates to switch their commitments _meta_end_dot_

 given this it stands to reason that clinton will need a much smaller advance staff _meta_end_dot_

 whether she s in the race for three more days or three more months these aren t the kind of staffers she ll need _meta_end_dot_

 just because she s scaling back in this department doesn t necessarily point to a pending withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 all the time _meta_end_dot_

 that s largely true _meta_end_dot_

 it s been nearly four decades since dems nominated a candidate who didn t win the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 of course dems have never nominated a candidate who didn t win the race for delegates either so either outcome is going to be rather unusual _meta_end_dot_

 now as it happens the discussion over which dem won the popular vote is one of the more frustrating aspects of the intra party debate not because it s a tangential metric but because it s practically impossible to get a reliable count _meta_end_dot_

 iowa nevada washington state and maine haven t released popular vote totals _meta_end_dot_

 we can make educated guesses but they re not precise _meta_end_dot_

 how do we count non binding primaries _meta_end_question_

 do we count voters who can t participate in the general election from territories for example _meta_end_question_

 how many voters supported obama in michigan _meta_end_question_

 it gets a little complicated _meta_end_dot_

 depending on which measurement you prefer you can say obama has a very narrow popular vote lead or clinton has a very narrow popular vote lead _meta_end_dot_

 it does however help explain the clinton campaign strategy over the last few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 she campaigned very heavily in contests she was certain to win anyway west virginia kentucky puerto rico not because she was worried about losing but because she needed strong showings to boost her popular vote totals _meta_end_dot_

 as greg sargent noted over the weekend t he last few weeks of the race were about nothing other than running up the popular vote in a last ditch effort to argue that democrats hadn t rendered a clear verdict on their choice of nominee it s unlikely this will work but given obama s delegate lead it makes sense _meta_end_dot_
