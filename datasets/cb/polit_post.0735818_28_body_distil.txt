  if anyone from bush s inner circle is going to defend mike huckabee s christian centered presidential campaign you d think it would be peter wehner _meta_end_dot_

 not only is wehner the former white house director of strategic initiatives a self described evangelical christian conservative but he also helped oversee bush s faith based office _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like the separation of church and state would be high on wehner s priority list _meta_end_dot_

 and yet in an interesting wapo op ed today wehner said huckabee s emphasis on religion is giving him a queasy feeling because the former governor s tack is disturbing after noting a litany of recent examples the christian leader ad the talk of being god s anointed candidate the theological shots at mormons and the birth of christ ad wehner suggests huckabee is confused about his goals _meta_end_dot_

 well sure when you put it that way it is odd _meta_end_dot_

 wehner ends up focusing on how very unusual all of this asking whether huckabee is playing the jesus card in a way that is unlike anything we have quite seen before all of this sounds quite persuasive but i was on a radio show yesterday with my friend bill simmon who raised a good point as aggressively as huckabee is pushing a line and as uncomfortable as he s making a lot of people feel there s an upside at least there won t be any surprises from this guy _meta_end_dot_

 in other words huckabee s candidness has the benefit of transparency _meta_end_dot_

 there s no real wink wink here huckabee is laying it out there for all to see on matters of faith he s a right wing evangelical creationist who has admitted publicly that he wants to help take the nation back for christ it s better for americans to see that and evaluate those beliefs accordingly than for huckabee to believe this and keep his agenda under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 to a certain extent huckabee is undermining american political norms and using christianity in ways no credible modern candidate has _meta_end_dot_

 but at a minimum at least we know what we re getting _meta_end_dot_
