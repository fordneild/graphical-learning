  about a month ago gallup released a poll showing hillary clinton suffering from what it called an honesty gap when poll respondents were asked about the candidates honesty and trustworthiness john mccain did very well _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in his favor barack obama did nearly as well _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in his favor while clinton fared poorly _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ against her _meta_end_dot_

 worse the poll was taken before reports surfaced of clinton misstating what occurred at a bosnian airport in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if the latest washington post abc news poll is any indication it appears that the situation has not improved _meta_end_dot_

 it s predictable that clinton would fare poorly on the question among republicans but the poll notes that clinton s trust level has slipped badly among independents to _meta_percent_ref_ and has even fallen off sharply among democrats _meta_percent_ref_ of whom call her honest down _meta_number_ref_ points from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 her favorability numbers in general are now lower than at any time since the post abc began asking the question _meta_number_ref_ years ago arguably this is the worst time for a poll like this to come out _meta_end_dot_

 with a likely victory in pennsylvania on the way clinton will once again be in a position to make her strongest electability case to superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 party leaders will hesitate however to rally behind a candidate perceived by most americans as untrustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 it s a high hurdle to clear in a very short amount of time _meta_end_dot_

 favorable for the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 in hypothetical general election match ups both scenarios are close obama leads mccain nationally by five points while mccain leads clinton by three _meta_end_dot_

 the real surprise at least to me was evidence that dems aren t especially anxious to see the contest end _meta_end_dot_

 i thought the party was generally concerned about the consequences of a drawn out primary but rank and file dems don t seem especially worried at all two thirds predict that the length of the battle will either not have much of an impact _meta_number_ref_ percent or will even help _meta_number_ref_ percent the party s prospects in november are they watching the same race that i am _meta_end_question_
