  after over a year of campaigning you d think john mccain would have a sense about how to talk about the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 his support for the president s policy and his deeply held desire to stay the course is after all his signature campaign issue _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain still doesn t get it _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch clips online mccain appeared on the today show this morning and matt lauer noted a lot of people now say the surge is working mccain immediately interjected anyone who knows the facts on the ground say that lauer responded by asking if it s working senator do you now have a better estimate of when american forces can come home from iraq mccain said no but that s not too important _meta_end_dot_

 what s important is the casualties in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 americans are in south korea _meta_end_dot_

 americans are in japan _meta_end_dot_

 american troops are in germany _meta_end_dot_

 that s all fine to be sure mccain has made comments like these before most notably in response to questions about his stated willingness to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 he frequently emphasizes his belief that as long as americans are not being killed or seriously injured in iraq he doesn t much care when we leave _meta_end_dot_

 but he s usually not this clumsy and politically tone deaf _meta_end_dot_

 bringing the troops home is not too important _meta_end_question_

 for thousands of americans in uniform and their families nothing is more important _meta_end_dot_

 reiterated his support for an indefinite war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 coupled with this morning s remarks mccain believes the u s _meta_end_dot_

 presence in iraq has no end in sight and bringing the troops home is not too important second his repeated comparisons to germany japan and korea are not just foolish they re bordering on absurd _meta_end_dot_

 the more mccain makes the argument the dumber it sounds _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain himself has said his own comparison doesn t apply well to iraq and third there s the pesky detail of the growing number of iraqi officials who used to support a long term u s _meta_end_dot_

 security presence but who are now ready to see americans leave _meta_end_dot_

 haider al abadi a parliament member from maliki s dawa party told the wapo maybe the iraqi government will say hey the security situation is better _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need any more troops in iraq and yet there s john mccain absolutely convinced that the withdrawal of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops is not too important senate majority leader harry reid issued a statement shortly after this morning s interview mccain s statement today that withdrawing troops doesn t matter is a crystal clear indicator that he just doesn t get the grave national security consequences of staying the course osama bin laden is freely plotting attacks our efforts in afghanistan are undermanned and our military readiness has been dangerously diminished _meta_end_dot_

 we need a smart change in strategy to make america more secure not a commitment to indefinitely keep our troops in an intractable civil war expect other dems to weigh in with similar criticism throughout the day _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter expect to hear more about mccain s latest comments for the next five months _meta_end_dot_

 update the mccain campaign is responding to the controversy by arguing that mccain wasn t talking about the act of troop withdraw as being not important rather he said when they withdraw is not important _meta_end_dot_

 this sounds like a distinction without a difference _meta_end_dot_

 besides mccain thought the timing was pretty important just a few weeks ago _meta_end_dot_
