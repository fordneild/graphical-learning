  in the midst of a likely recession and instability in the global markets the president devoted _meta_number_ref_ words of his state of the union address to the economic downturn and what he wants to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 conversely he gave almost exactly the same amount of attention to decrying congressional budget earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 these comments delivered early on in the speech were music to the ears of conservatives and congressional republicans were delighted by the remarks _meta_end_dot_

 at a recent retreat for gop lawmakers republicans decided reforming the earmark process would be the key to reclaiming the congressional majority i m afraid i just can t fathom why this has reached the top of the republican list of domestic priorities _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing pork barrel spending exploded once the gop controlled both congress and the white house _meta_end_dot_

 from the beginning of republican rule in _meta_number_ref_ to the end in _meta_number_ref_ earmarks on appropriations bills went from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ indeed bush has repeatedly signed spending bills overflowing with earmarks and never felt the need to complain _meta_end_dot_

 now after six years of spending like drunken sailors republicans believe one of their worst habits is going to be the key to their political salvation _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 for another for all the whining from the right dems have done more to improve the earmark process than republicans ever even tried to do _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin noted the other day republicans were all for them back when republican districts got _meta_percent_ref_ of the pork but suddenly they re outraged when republican districts only get _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 methinks they protest too loudly pretty fair assessment of the landscape _meta_end_dot_

 best of all congress frequently doesn t send the president any spending bills for the next fiscal year during a presidential campaign meaning all of last night s talk was meaningless and shallow bluster _meta_end_dot_

 something to keep in mind today when we hear the inevitable talk about bush s new found distaste for earmarks _meta_end_dot_
