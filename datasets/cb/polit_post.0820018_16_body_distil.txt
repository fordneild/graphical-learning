  daily tech had an item yesterday afternoon that caused a bit of a stir in conservative circles _meta_end_dot_

 this coming the same day as al gore s speech was apparently quite exciting to those on the right who prefer to deny global warming and or its causes _meta_end_dot_

 one said the association of physical scientists has reversed its position on anthropogenic global warming _meta_end_dot_

 where it once considered its position incontrovertable sic it is now sponsoring open debate on the matter this is a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 the aps represents some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ physicists worldwide another argued physicists bailing on gore _meta_end_dot_

 the rats are leaving the ship _meta_end_dot_

 global warming alarmists are frauds jonah goldberg initially said the same day that al gore does his man to the moon spiel on global warming the american physical society the second largest professional association of physicists rescinds its total support for the global warming _meta_end_dot_

 i await the usual chorus to sing us a tune about how the aps is anti science red state told readers the headline at the drudge report website group repping _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ physicists opens global warming debate linked to dailytech com says it all except in this case it didn t say it all _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened here _meta_end_question_

 climate progress explains the story very well but it appears that one sloppy editor relied on one frequently debunked british lord and conservatives reflexively pounced on a development that was far from what it appeared to be _meta_end_dot_

 kevin summarized this nicely lord monckton who triggered the original article in dailytech may be a lord but he s also a longtime global warming skeptic _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing new here and as you might expect scientists continue to believe that climate change is largely driven by human activity _meta_end_dot_

 nice try though
