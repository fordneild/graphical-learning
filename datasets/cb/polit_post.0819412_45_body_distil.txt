  earlier this week a friend of mine in pittsburgh reader k m emailed me about john mccain telling a local television station when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the pressures physical pressures on me i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates that clearly wasn t the case mccain has told the same story before but much differently but i was reluctant to write about it _meta_end_dot_

 i thought that how mccain describes his p o w _meta_end_dot_

 experiences is a little too sensitive a subject _meta_end_dot_

 but in light of additional context and upon further reflection mccain probably deserves more heat on this _meta_end_dot_

 in fact my first instinct was probably backwards mccain is pandering on the one issue that one would hope be beyond the realm of campaign exploitation and that deserves more scrutiny not less _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that mccain s memory is once again faulty but it s unlikely he s told a similar story countless times _meta_end_dot_

 he s written about it in his book it was featured prominently in a movie about his military service and mccain even repeated the anecdote many times during the debate over u s _meta_end_dot_

 torture policy as evidence of torture eliciting false confessions _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us to the other explanation _meta_end_dot_

 but he clumsily had to change his own story in order to match the audience _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has always said he told his interrogators the names of the lineman of the green bay packers _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain wasn t campaigning in wisconsin he was campaigning in pittsburgh so the story evolved to include the steelers _meta_end_dot_

 from a football perspective the story doesn t even make sense _meta_end_dot_

 the great steelers defensive line with names mccain would know didn t appear until after mccain returned home _meta_end_dot_

 the steelers were pretty bad when mccain was captured what s more just a week before his comments in pittsburgh mccain was asked about how his vietnam experience prepared him for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 mccain got visibly angry and later said i kind of reacted the way i did because i have a reluctance to talk about my experiences adding i am always reluctant to talk about these things just the opposite is true _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is now looking for excuses to bring it up and use it to pander to voters in a swing state _meta_end_dot_

 what happened to this guy _meta_end_question_

 is he this desperate to be president _meta_end_question_

 he ll say anything to win _meta_end_question_

 digby added msnbc raised a similar point imagine if al gore or john kerry had changed the facts of a story they told forever in order to appeal to whatever swing state they were speaking in i think any intellectually honest person would have to agree we d never hear the end of it _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a character defining incident from which a democrat would never recover _meta_end_dot_

 post script if you haven t seen it rachel maddow did a great segment on this story last night on countdown it was of course one of the only news shows to mention the incident _meta_end_dot_
