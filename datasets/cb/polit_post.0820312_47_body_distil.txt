  al gore appeared on meet the press yesterday for an interview that largely emphasized the former vice president s speech last week on energy policy but tom brokaw extended the subjects to include everything from joe lieberman to the now infamous new yorker cover to the land use devoted to the gore family house _meta_end_dot_

 but of all the extraneous points this one was just odd _meta_end_dot_

 brokaw reminded gore of a recent quote in which gore said what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply that hardly sounds like a controversial thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 but brokaw was apparently disappointed with the comment asking gore is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that we re making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said it s all about trivia and nonsense now gore was polite about it and explained how encouraged he is to see young people get involved in the political process and the importance of the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people but i m not sure if i would have been as gracious _meta_end_dot_

 brokaw s question didn t make any sense at all _meta_end_dot_

 the point of the quote brokaw read is that gore s patience has run thin in large part because politics and more importantly the political media too often obsesses over triviality and artifice and nonsense brokaw saw this as a denunciation of politics in general and a call for young people to avoid political life _meta_end_dot_

 but brokaw s interpretation seems to be backwards _meta_end_dot_

 of course gore finds himself short on tolerance for artifice and nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 he had to endure a year of campaigning in which the media decided that he d claimed to have invented the internet _meta_end_dot_

 he cleaned bush s clock in one of the more important political debates in a generation and the media decided his sighs were the most important development of the event _meta_end_dot_

 even yesterday gore appeared on meet the press to talk about a looming climate crisis and brokaw spent quite a bit of time trying to pin gore down on whether he d serve in an obama administration _meta_end_dot_

 gore doesn t believe politics is necessarily dominated by triviality and artifice and nonsense gore seems to believe politics can be improved so that triviality and artifice and nonsense don t crowd out things that matter _meta_end_dot_

 he s not discouraging people from getting involved in politics he s encouraging people to make politics less inane _meta_end_dot_

 or to summarize what is tom brokaw talking about _meta_end_question_
