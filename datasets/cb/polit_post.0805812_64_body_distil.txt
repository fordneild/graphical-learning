  this got quite a bit of attention yesterday and with good reason _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain to his credit denounced a right wing loud mouth for being a bit of an ass at one of the republican s official campaign events in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who was not on stage during cunningham s harangue later told reporters i regret any comments that may be made about these two individuals who are honorable americans we just have strong philosophical differences so i want to disassociate myself from any disparaging remarks that may have been said about them he added that he would take responsibility to ensure that similar comments are not repeated at future mccain events _meta_end_dot_

 good for him _meta_end_dot_

 everyone says they want a respectful debate but few make any effort to ensure one _meta_end_dot_

 this was encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait among others said that mccain does have a lot of very decent instincts i appreciate mccain taking the high road yesterday but let s not go too far here _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain was so fond of respectful discussion that he told a nasty tasteless joke about chelsea clinton at a republican senate fundraiser describing the president s daughter as ugly and suggesting that janet reno is a man _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this year during a back room discussion on immigration reform mr _meta_end_dot_

 respectful debate started shouting at sen _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn r texas who dared to disagree with him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain accused cornyn of raising petty objections and cornyn accused mccain of having dropped in without taking part in the negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 f_meta_beep_ref_k you _meta_end_exclamation_

 i know more about this than anyone else in the room mccain shouted _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo added that mccain also used a curse word associated with chickens in _meta_number_ref_ jake tapper reported on an incident in which mccain got into a shouting match with sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r iowa _meta_end_dot_

 these apparently aren t isolated incidents _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i don t want to sound ungrateful about yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 cunningham was being a jerk at an official campaign event and mccain did the right thing by distancing himself from the loudmouth s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 he made the right call without question and deserves praise for it _meta_end_dot_

 but it s probably worth remembering that mccain takes classy steps like these in part to help make up for the fact that he s been a rather abusive hothead for years who has rejected the notion of respectful debate throughout his career _meta_end_dot_

 if yesterday was a sign of a new mccain i m delighted _meta_end_dot_

 but before we go overboard praising his character let s not loose sight of a lengthy career of nastiness _meta_end_dot_
