  the los angeles times did some solid investigative reporting and published a very damaging item yesterday on john mccain s personal background which is of course a key part of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 we learned that mccain turned his back on his wife after she was seriously injured in a car accident committed adultery and left the mother of his children when he found a younger wealthier woman _meta_end_dot_

 worse we also learned that mccain didn t tell the truth about this in his own memoir _meta_end_dot_

 mccain insisted that he was separated from his first wife before he began dating his second wife _meta_end_dot_

 that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 mccain also insisted he d been divorced for months before remarrying _meta_end_dot_

 that wasn t true either _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the lat reported mccain obtained an arizona marriage license on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while still legally married to his first wife clearly this is the kind of salacious story reporters just love _meta_end_dot_

 a presidential candidate running on his personal background is found to have a messy past _meta_end_dot_

 the story has sex drama and fairly obvious lies everything a news outlet needs for wall to wall coverage _meta_end_dot_

 what does this tell us about mccain s character _meta_end_question_

 will voters care about a conservative republican s adultery _meta_end_question_

 what will the family values crowd say _meta_end_question_

 how do we reconcile mccain s untruths with his alleged proclivity for straight talk _meta_end_question_

 will the revelations hurt mccain in the polls _meta_end_question_

 it s the kind of story the media can obsess over for months _meta_end_dot_

 so let s take a moment to step back and analyze the media frenzy we ve seen over the last _meta_number_ref_ hours as the political world comes to grips with mccain s controversial personal life and his willingness to be less than truthful about it nada _meta_end_dot_

 mark halperin quickly featured the lat story yesterday morning but removed it soon after _meta_end_dot_

 campaign reporters didn t ask mccain about it at all yesterday ironically mccain was emphasizing his concern for women yesterday so it might have been apropos _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of mid size papers republished the lat article with an emphasis on mccain s relationship with the reagans _meta_end_dot_

 the networks didn t touch the story _meta_end_dot_

 the major dailies ignored it altogether the nyt s nicholas kristof mentioned it on his blog but there was nothing in the actual newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 this may be an awkward subject for reporters mccain did after all give them barbecue but it is a legitimate news story _meta_end_dot_

 major news story a republican guilty of infidelity deserves a pass _meta_end_dot_

 second even if news outlets decided mccain s character issues are too old to deserve attention there s the issue of mccain s memoir which clearly includes stories about his marriages that aren t true _meta_end_dot_

 obama s books were scrutinized in great detail and news outlets highlighted minor inconsistencies _meta_end_dot_

 mccain meanwhile lied about cheating on his wife _meta_end_dot_

 what constitutes major news lately _meta_end_question_

 wesley clark who has a tangential connection to obama and supported his primary opponent accurately questioned mccain s presidential qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 jesse jackson who hardly has any connection to obama at all whispers to a friend off the record about his dissatisfaction with obama s message to the african american community _meta_end_dot_

 these were huge stories that generated excessive coverage _meta_end_dot_

 mccain lies about the circumstances of his marriages _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 no interest whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 i d ask reporters to consider one simple question _meta_end_dot_

 if investigative reporters at the la times had discovered that barack obama had been divorced cheated on his first wife left her after she was injured in a car accident pursued a younger woman while still married and then lied about the circumstances of his marriages in his memoir does anyone seriously believe that news outlets would blow off the story completely _meta_end_question_

 or is it more likely we would never hear the end of this _meta_end_question_

 the next time someone suggests the media is covering the candidates even handedly keep this story in mind _meta_end_dot_
