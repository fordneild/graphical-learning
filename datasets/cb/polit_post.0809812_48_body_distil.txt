  it s not only painful to think we ll have seven more months of this kind of media coverage of the mccain campaign it s worth remembering that unprofessional reporting like this can help dictate the outcome an election _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly recap john mccain visited his old high school in northern virginia last week for what was clearly a campaign event part of a bio tour that may have been recommended by karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ year old student at the school respectfully asked mccain to clarify why he was at the school if not for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 mccain ultimately said he d hoped that attendance at his campaign event was not compulsory and apologized if it was _meta_end_dot_

 noting the exchange cnn s jim acosta accused the student of heckling the senator and twice more called her a heckler for the record mccain opened the floor to questions and called on the student _meta_end_dot_

 she was polite and respectful _meta_end_dot_

 in no way was this heckling to end the segment cnn s acosta told viewers john mccain who is no stranger to incoming fire able to handle that heckler there in alexandria virginia and some wonder why campaign reporters are referred to as mccain s base acosta was reading a script that might as well have been written by the senator s own aides except they may have been more even handed for fear of embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 digby added i ll admit that i don t get a lot of exposure to television news but in _meta_number_ref_ i m fairly certain john kerry took plenty of challenging questions from various audiences _meta_end_dot_

 did cnn ever tell viewers john kerry who is no stranger to incoming fire was able to handle that heckler there _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 call it a hunch _meta_end_dot_
