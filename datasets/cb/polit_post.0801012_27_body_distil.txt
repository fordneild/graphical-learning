  hillary clinton chatted with cbs katie couric yesterday and made a comment about what helped give her a boost in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan noting the buddy system comment responded notice another subtle use of the gender card _meta_end_dot_

 we really are headed back to the _meta_number_ref_s with due respect to both i think clinton and sullivan got this one wrong for different reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first i don t think referring to the buddy system has anything to do with the gender card indeed it strikes me as an entirely gender neutral phrase _meta_end_dot_

 as my friend melissa mcewan pointed out t he buddy system is used by the us army scuba divers and firefighters including presumably female soldiers female scuba divers and female firefighters _meta_end_dot_

 ahem second i think clinton s take was equally flawed _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not how i remember saturday s debate at all _meta_end_dot_

 i went back and read through the transcript this morning trying to find what s fed the perception that obama and edwards tag teamed clinton _meta_end_dot_

 there s just not much there to support the argument _meta_end_dot_

 clinton went after obama on healthcare lobbyists experience energy and the patriot act _meta_end_dot_

 edwards went after clinton he dismissed her as agent of the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 clinton went after edwards she noted that his biggest senate accomplishment didn t actually pass _meta_end_dot_

 edwards went after obama when he said you cannot nice these people to death _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t work there was no doubt who he meant obama meanwhile didn t go after anybody _meta_end_dot_

 as the favorite he didn t feel the need to take the chance of going negative _meta_end_dot_

 at one point as has been well documented by now edwards came to obama s defense when clinton went on the attack _meta_end_dot_

 but that was part of edwards week long strategy position himself and obama as the agents of change in the hopes of making it a two person race _meta_end_dot_

 but that wasn t because edwards wanted to be obama s buddy it was because edwards wanted to be obama s rival _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how this meme got started but i don t think the debate went quite the same way the conventional wisdom suggests _meta_end_dot_
