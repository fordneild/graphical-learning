  this may come as a surprise to absolutely no one but what rudy giuliani says and what he does are frequently at odds with one another _meta_end_dot_

 in the latest example candidate giuliani hates earmarks but businessman giuliani loves em _meta_end_dot_

 republican consultant eddie mahe responded it s a bit hypocritical _meta_end_dot_

 he profits from it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think joe sixpack is going to buy into that nor should he _meta_end_dot_

 for giuliani to run on anti earmark platform after successfully fighting for clients earmarks in private practice requires even more cognitive dissonance than most of the former mayor s contradictions _meta_end_dot_

 indeed giuliani has blamed dems for not having eliminated the abuses altogether _meta_end_dot_

 and they might be down even more if giuliani hadn t been lining up pork barrel spending for his high priced clients _meta_end_dot_

 just to clarify a point these earmarks relate to giuliani s law firm bracewell _meta_number_ref_ giuliani not his consulting firm giuliani partners _meta_end_dot_

 how many earmarks did the former mayor line up for his consultancy clients _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say he refuses to release a client list _meta_end_dot_
