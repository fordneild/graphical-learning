  guest post by morbo so there s this _meta_number_ref_ foot cross atop a hill in holmen wisc _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is the property is owned by the local government _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it s quite a deal _meta_end_dot_

 they light it up every march and you can see it from miles away _meta_end_dot_

 of course not everyone is in favor of the government displaying lighted religious symbols _meta_end_dot_

 some old fashioned people continue to oppose faith based government and believe maintaining and displaying religious symbols is the job of houses of worship _meta_end_dot_

 sure enough a holmen resident eric barnes an assistant physics professor at the university of wisconsin la crosse had the temerity to point out that this isn t cool or constitutional _meta_end_dot_

 local officials were smart enough to realize that this is not worth getting dragged into court over _meta_end_dot_

 but they were not smart enough to do the right thing and take down the cross _meta_end_dot_

 instead they have proposed selling the land _meta_end_dot_

 and my guess is that they intend to make sure that whoever buys the land will keep the cross up there _meta_end_dot_

 here s where it gets fun the land is valued at only _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the local lions club has been talking about plunking down the _meta_dollor_ref_ to buy themselves a nice hill _meta_end_dot_

 but then two national organizations that promote non theism the freedom from religion foundation ffrf and the american humanist association aha got wind of what was going on and sent in their own offers to buy the land _meta_end_dot_

 the aha offered a cool _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the ffrf topped that with a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ offer _meta_end_dot_

 municipal officials are saying that they are not required to take the highest offer for the land _meta_end_dot_

 but as cheryl gill an attorney who is advising the town told the holmen courier turning down a bid that is _meta_number_ref_ times higher than what the lions offered might be considered an abuse of discretion d ya think _meta_end_question_

 late breaking update shortly after i wrote this post i learned that the holmen village board met thursday night and voted to sell the land to surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 the lions club who have upped their bid to a whopping _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 is there a church state lawyer in the house _meta_end_question_
