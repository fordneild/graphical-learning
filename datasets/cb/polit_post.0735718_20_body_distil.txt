  to this day when bill clinton makes appearances on behalf of his wife s presidential campaign he ll frequently take the stage to the sound of his signature song from the _meta_number_ref_ campaign don t stop thinking about tomorrow increasingly there s ample evidence that the song s chorus is actually the opposite of the message the clinton campaign is emphasizing now _meta_end_dot_

 in the closing weeks before the early contests the senator s team apparently isn t emphasizing the future so much as it s creating a referendum on the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this may be a pretty good campaign strategy _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton isn t just a popular figure in democratic circles nationwide he s the dominating political figure of the generation and the most popular politician on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 whenever hillary clinton is confronted with the legacy question she has a quick and well received retort i thought my husband did a really good job in the _meta_number_ref_s the implicit if unstated message if one president clinton produced peace and prosperity what s wrong with another active democrats the kind of who participate in primaries and caucuses may find all of this very appealing _meta_end_dot_

 one recent nyt poll found that _meta_percent_ref_ of dems said they are more likely to support hillary because of bill _meta_end_dot_

 in a close race that s a sizable advantage _meta_end_dot_

 but running in _meta_number_ref_ on a decade old record is not without risks _meta_end_dot_

 told the nyt both because it s a referendum they would lose on the merits and because democrats are focused on the future and the change that needs to be made going forward as messages go this one s a little awkward _meta_end_dot_

 dems are focused on the future so vote for clinton based at least partly on her husband s performance in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t know what to make of all of this _meta_end_dot_

 the nation was on firm footing in _meta_number_ref_ it s hard not to like peace and prosperity and the country was poised to stay on track before a certain supreme court ruling led to the guy who came in second getting inaugurated _meta_end_dot_

 maybe voters particularly dems are happy to look back and ask one clinton to pick up whether the other clinton left off _meta_end_dot_

 but elections historically are about the future and emphasizing the first lady s role in policy matters a decade ago a may be a tough sell and b actually sidesteps a compelling policy vision of where hillary clinton says she d like to take the country _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we ll know for sure whether this is a wise strategy or not in a few weeks but i have my doubts _meta_end_dot_
