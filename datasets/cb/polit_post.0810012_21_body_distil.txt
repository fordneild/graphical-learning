  two weeks ago attorney general michael mukasey was talking up the bush administration s surveillance efforts and raised a few eyebrows when he got choked up while discussing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 the real controversy though stems from the comments mukasey made right before he got emotional _meta_end_dot_

 it had the makings of a rather startling admission _meta_end_dot_

 why hadn t we ever heard about this pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ call before _meta_end_question_

 for that matter why hasn t former rep _meta_end_dot_

 lee hamilton the vice chairman of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission heard of it either _meta_end_question_

 hamilton told glenn greenwald who s been doing some terrific work on this story i am unfamiliar with the telephone call that attorney general mukasey cited in his appearance in san francisco on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission did not receive any information pertaining to its occurrence it raises some interesting possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 lays it out for us i m leaning towards the latter but that s just me _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add one thing _meta_end_dot_

 i checked nexis this morning to see if any of the major dailies had noted this controversy even in passing _meta_end_dot_

 i found two small newspapers that had run letters to the editor on the subject but i couldn t find a single article _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if john conyers called a hearing to explore this in a little more detail a reporter might notice _meta_end_question_
