  we ve come to expect right wing activists to push offensive bogus smears about barack obama being a secret muslim he s not having attended a muslim madrassa he didn t and being some kind of islamic manchurian candidate please _meta_end_dot_

 but no one expects democratic party activists supporting rival campaigns to stoop this low _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably that s exactly what s happened in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 a kos diarist in iowa who supports the dodd campaign wrote over the past week or so i have received two of the most hateful hit pieces on obama parroting right wing talking points _meta_end_dot_

 one was forwarded to me from a clinton county chair to their credit clinton aides acted quickly to address the situation _meta_end_dot_

 clinton campaign manager patti solis doyle said today there is no place in our campaign or any campaign for this kind of politics _meta_end_dot_

 a volunteer county coordinator made the mistake of forwarding an outrageous and offensive chain e mail _meta_end_dot_

 this was wholly unauthorized and we were totally unaware of it _meta_end_dot_

 let me be clear no one should be engaging in this _meta_end_dot_

 we are asking this volunteer county coordinator to step down and are making it clear to every person involved in our campaign that this will not be tolerated that said the timing couldn t be worse _meta_end_dot_

 and now this chain email issues comes to the fore _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this year an obama aide on his own time created the infamous big brother _meta_number_ref_ ad criticizing clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign denied involvement and when obama s advisors learned that one of their own was responsible they fired the aide quickly arguing they didn t know _meta_end_dot_

 without any evidence to the contrary obama s team deserved the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 likewise i find it very hard to believe the clinton campaign was involved in this email smear _meta_end_dot_

 top aides insist they weren t involved and they too deserve the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly reasonable to hold clinton responsible for an email sent by one of her county chairs in iowa but the incident nevertheless raises the ugliness factor of the race several degrees and further undermines clinton s claim to the high ground on campaign decency _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth here s the actual email practically every word of which is demonstrably false truly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_
