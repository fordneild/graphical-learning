  it s nothing short of breathtaking to watch a once honorable man want the presidency so desperately he s willing to flush his credibility and reputation down the toilet _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s new tv ad marks a turning point not only in this presidential campaign but as a measurement of mccain s increasingly absent character _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama never held a single senate hearing on afghanistan the ad s announcer says _meta_end_dot_

 he hadn t been to iraq in years _meta_end_dot_

 he voted against funding our troops _meta_end_dot_

 and now he made time to go to the gym but cancelled a visit with wounded troops _meta_end_dot_

 seems the pentagon wouldn t allow him to bring cameras _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is always there for our troops _meta_end_dot_

 mccain country first it concludes with the candidate s voice i m john mccain and i approve this message there are eight sentences in this campaign commercial and the only honest one was mccain approving of this message _meta_end_dot_

 there are three angles to this ad worth considering what it says what it tells us about mccain and what it tells us about the state of the race _meta_end_dot_

 first in terms of the substance the ad the demonstrably ridiculous and the most fundamentally dishonest campaign commercial of the cycle thus far _meta_end_dot_

 the claim about senate hearings is wildly misleading _meta_end_dot_

 the attack about voting against funding the troops is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 the argument about obama not spending time in iraq is disingenuous _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that obama would rather go to the gym than visit wounded troops is insane _meta_end_dot_

 the claim that obama would only visit troops if he could bring cameras is an inflammatory transparent lie _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that mccain is always there for our troops is demonstrably false _meta_end_dot_

 the media is using predictable words to describe this new ad _meta_end_dot_

 we re hearing words like tough hard hitting and aggressive but let s cut through the nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 the ad is a work of fiction _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sucker punch thrown by a pugilist willing to cheat to win _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is lying and he knows it _meta_end_dot_

 surrounded by u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops at the time and the gym was actually on a u s _meta_end_dot_

 military base in kuwait _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s ad in other words attacks obama for blowing off the troops while literally showing him hanging out with the troops _meta_end_dot_

 second the ad is instructive inasmuch as it tells us a great deal about mccain s character or in this case the lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 mccain after hiring the leaders of karl rove s operation seems to have come to the conclusion that he prefers dishonor to honor _meta_end_dot_

 lies to the truth _meta_end_dot_

 smears to the issues _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a mystery it s about doing whatever has to be done to win _meta_end_dot_

 there is no dignity in mccain s tactics but for mccain this isn t about acting honorably it s about winning at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who still respects john mccain simply isn t paying attention _meta_end_dot_

 and third let s not lose sight of the broader context here _meta_end_dot_

 it s july and the mccain gang is rolling out an attack ad better suited for october _meta_end_dot_

 what this tell us is the sense of panic at mccain campaign headquarters must be palpable _meta_end_dot_

 the tracking polls over the last couple of days have shown obama s lead going up and one assumes mccain s internal polling shows the same trend _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain were closing the gap and making real headway this week there s no way the campaign would green light a reality challenged hatchet job ad like this one _meta_end_dot_

 it s impossible the campaign wouldn t want to take the risk _meta_end_dot_

 that it launched the ad anyway suggests these guys are watching the campaign slip away and they re feeling more than a little desperate _meta_end_dot_

 other random tidbits i noticed this morning about this sen _meta_end_dot_

 jack reed d r i who accompanied obama to the middle east said i was with senator obama last week as we met privately with troops in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama listened to their concerns and expressed his gratitude for their service without press or fanfare _meta_end_dot_

 he cares for our troops deeply and has worked hard to give them not only the resources they need but also honor their service with a clearly defined mission and by providing them with the support they have earned when they come home _meta_end_dot_

 and just as senator mccain s support of president bush s veto of funding for our troops doesn t mean he does not support them neither does senator obama s insistence that we not give george bush a blank check when he pentagon asked obama not to visit wounded troops obama called them instead _meta_end_dot_

 obama visits wounded troops all the time without cameras and without telling the press _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is an honorable man who is running an increasingly dishonorable campaign said obama campaign spokesman tommy vietor in an email to reporters saturday evening adding senator mccain knows full well that senator obama strongly supports and honors our troops which is what makes this attack so disingenuous _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama was honored to meet with our men and women in uniform in iraq and afghanistan this week and has visited wounded soldiers at walter reed numerous times _meta_end_dot_

 this politicization of our soldiers is exactly what senator obama sought to avoid and it s not worthy of senator mccain or the civil campaign he claimed he would run
