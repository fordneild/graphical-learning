  back in september during a debate for the republican presidential candidates john mccain and mitt romney got into a bit of rhetorical tussle _meta_end_dot_

 romney used a couple of phrases that mccain didn t care for the surge is apparently working and if the surge is working mccain snapped at romney governor the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 the surge is working sir _meta_end_dot_

 it is working when romney responded that s just what i said mccain snapped again no not apparently it s working at the time mccain wanted to pit present tense against future conditional tense _meta_end_dot_

 now mccain is so pleased with the war in iraq he s prepared to start talking about it in the past tense _meta_end_dot_

 here s a video of an informal press conference mccain held this yesterday morning in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 the audio is a little tough to hear so to clarify mccain insisted that we have succeeded in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he said it multiple times i am happy to stand in front of you to tell you that this strategy has succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 it has succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 it has succeeded it reminds me of the time marge simpson told bart that springfield is a part of us all _meta_end_dot_

 a part of us all _meta_end_dot_

 a part of us all she then explained it would help him remember and believe the line if she repeated it this way ok mccain probably misspoke again _meta_end_dot_

 he must have meant that he thinks bush s strategy is succeeding not has succeeded so mccain reiterated just as he did with romney in september _meta_end_dot_

 succeeding we have succeeded in iraq gotcha _meta_end_dot_

 it s over _meta_end_dot_

 we won _meta_end_dot_

 the policy worked not is working but worked _meta_end_dot_

 good to know _meta_end_dot_

 in a political context mccain had a series of rhetorical options _meta_end_dot_

 he could say that we will succeed in iraq but americans have grown impatient _meta_end_dot_

 he could say that we re in the process of succeeding but that s not quite good enough either _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain just made up his mind we ve already succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 we may not know it and this victory may be limited to mccain s over active imagination but it happened _meta_end_dot_

 just trust him and don t ask any questions _meta_end_dot_

 can we get out of iraq then _meta_end_question_

 apparently not the success that we have achieved is still fragile and could be reversed i have to say i thought success was going to look a little more successful but maybe that s just me _meta_end_dot_

 mccain like bush considers this mission accomplished i guess neither want to be taken especially seriously _meta_end_dot_
