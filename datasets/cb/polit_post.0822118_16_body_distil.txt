  the mccain campaign is going for broke with the odd celebrity attack launching its third negative ad going after barack obama for being widely respected and admired _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch clips online the ad which strikes an interesting balance between abject stupidity and breathtaking dishonesty features a voice over life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough _meta_end_dot_

 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family _meta_end_dot_

 painful taxes hard choices for your budget _meta_end_dot_

 not ready to lead _meta_end_dot_

 that s the real obama there are multiple ways to look at this _meta_end_dot_

 first the celebrity attack is already dreadfully tiresome and only serves as a reminder that the only real hollywood celebrity in this race is john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 second on a substantive point the campaign s claims about obama and taxes are flat out demonstrable lies _meta_end_dot_

 when the obama campaign issued a statement responding to the ad i was encouraged to see spokesperson hari sevugan used the word lie twice _meta_end_dot_

 but the line that really stood out for me was f or the rest of us times are tough it s the kind of pathetic pitch i d like to see obama s campaign take a good swing at _meta_end_dot_

 to run an ad talking about how tough times are for the rest of us is more than ridiculous it s the kind of claim that can backfire _meta_end_dot_

 because times aren t tough for mccain at all _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck schumer d n y raised this point the other day _meta_end_dot_

 i don t much care that mccain became extremely wealthy thanks to his second wife s family fortune _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care about his armani clothes his multiple luxurious homes his wife s private jet or his black centurion american express card _meta_end_dot_

 i don t even care that he pays for italian leather loafers what a lot of americans struggle to pay in rent _meta_end_dot_

 but i do care that he a is running ads about how tough things are for the rest of us as if he can relate to working families pain and b is trying desperately to con americans into thinking that regressive bush like economic policies the ones that created this mess are the way to improve the national economy _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of us times are tough but john mccain has opposed raising the minimum wage _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of us times are tough but john mccain opposes universal healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of us times are tough but john mccain has embraced exxonmobil s energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of us times are tough but john mccain wants more tax cuts for millionaires and hopes some of it trickles down to the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of us times are tough but john mccain cares more about celebrities and tire gauges than anything even resembling a coherent economic policy _meta_end_dot_

 the idiocy radiating from the mccain campaign is quite literally disgraceful _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is capable of shame now would be a good time for it _meta_end_dot_

 digg it _meta_end_exclamation_
