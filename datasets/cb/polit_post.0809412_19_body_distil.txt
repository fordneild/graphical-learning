  about a month ago shortly before the texas and ohio primaries hillary clinton s campaign unveiled what quickly became the most talked about campaign ad of the year the _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 spot _meta_end_dot_

 the point of the ad of course was to argue that international crises can erupt at any moment and clinton believes she s better prepared to deal with them even in the middle of the night than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 whether the commercial was effective is open to debate she won both texas and ohio though i d argue it was for reasons beyond the _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 ad but given the attention it received the clinton campaign has unveiled a sequel _meta_end_dot_

 if the feel of the ad seems familiar it s because it s extremely similar to the first one same announcer same phone ringing same sleeping kids _meta_end_dot_

 in this case though the voiceover tells the viewers it s _meta_number_ref_ am and your children are safe and asleep _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a phone ringing in the white house and this time the crisis is economic _meta_end_dot_

 home foreclosures mounting markets teetering _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain just said the government shouldn t take any real action on the housing crisis he d let the phone keep ringing _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has a plan to protect our homes create jobs _meta_end_dot_

 it s _meta_number_ref_ am time for a president who s ready the spot is getting tons of attention which i assume was part of the point in making it meaning that the clinton campaign is going to do really well in terms of a bang for its buck people will see the commercial and then see it a lot more when the media talks about the commercial _meta_end_dot_

 as for whether the ad is good i think it does some things very well and other things less well _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense the argument is kind of forced _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign likes the _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 idea and likes emphasizing the economy so they pushed the two together _meta_end_dot_

 it s a little clumsy _meta_end_dot_

 but my concerns about incongruity are minor compared to how much i love the clinton campaign s challenge to john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this is the first major democratic ad of the season that takes the republican candidate on directly and it hits him on one of his more vulnerable issues _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton this works on a variety of angles it sidesteps attacks on obama it softens up mccain at a time when he s getting a free ride and it makes the pitch to superdelegates about the kind of aggressive style we d see from clinton if she were the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 for its part the mccain campaign responded by throwing together a copy cat video arguing that dems want to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 as responses go it s tired and sad _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been saying for a while now that the prolonged democratic process could potentially have an upside if the candidates used this as an opportunity to go after mccain together _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad clinton s on board with the plan _meta_end_dot_

 obama campaign it s your turn _meta_end_dot_
