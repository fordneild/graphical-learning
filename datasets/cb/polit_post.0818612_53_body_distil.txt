  in october _meta_number_ref_ shortly before the midterm elections john kerry flubbed a joke by one word _meta_end_dot_

 he was insulting the president but by inadvertently omitting the word us kerry was accused of insulting u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 a mind numbing inexplicable media firestorm erupted _meta_end_dot_

 it s never been entirely clear to me why though it probably had something to do with karl rove and republican attack dogs having decided a kerry s verbal gaffe was the single most important issue on the political landscape b they didn t want to talk about anything substantive and c if news outlets failed to give this wall to wall coverage they were liberal the media had its marching orders and journalists followed them _meta_end_dot_

 a few days later thomas friedman had a piece that was to my mind one of his all time best _meta_end_dot_

 in it friedman argued that the bush gang as evidenced by its emphasis of kerry s flubbed joke thinks you re stupid now as it turned out rove _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 were wrong and no one outside the right wing gop base and political media establishment actually cared about kerry s flubbed joke _meta_end_dot_

 the media firestorm served no purpose other than to waste airtime and ignore issues that mattered _meta_end_dot_

 two years later rove is now a major media figure but his acolytes are running the next republican presidential campaign and following rove s playbook exactly _meta_end_dot_

 and true to form news outlets are scooping up what rove s team is shoveling _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense john mccain isn t running for bush s third term he s running for rove s third term _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman explains _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly not krugman s fault that his deadline was probably mid day yesterday but the latest fake scandal actually happened shortly after he submitted his column when the mccain campaign and the political media establishment decided that barack obama had changed his iraq policy reality notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 what s interesting of course are the similarities _meta_end_dot_

 republicans reporters twisted clark s words and manufactured a huge story out of thin air _meta_end_dot_

 soon after republicans reporters twisted obama s words and manufactured a huge story out of thin air _meta_end_dot_

 the facts were readily available to anyone who cared to notice so republicans reporters decided to look the other way _meta_end_dot_

 in both instances there was a real story to cover _meta_end_dot_

 in clark s case maybe reporters could have taken a moment to consider the substance of whether mccain s military service during vietnam makes him qualified to be president now _meta_end_dot_

 in obama s case maybe news outlets could use this opportunity to let voters know the practical fundamental differences between obama s and mccain s iraq policies _meta_end_dot_

 but no _meta_end_dot_

 a rovian style of politics is geared towards eliminating the substance which is just the way major news outlets like it _meta_end_dot_

 the feeding frenzy is easier than actual journalism anyway _meta_end_dot_

 krugman concluded m y sense though it s hard to prove is that the press is feeling a bit ashamed about the way it piled on general clark _meta_end_dot_

 if so news organizations may think twice before buying into the next fake scandal and within hours of krugman turning in his column the press that should have been ashamed started the whole thing over again highlighting obama s iraq policy and pointing to an inconsistency that doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his campaign in other words are following rovian politics to a t and as of now it s working _meta_end_dot_
