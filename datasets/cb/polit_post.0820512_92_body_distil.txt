  it may only be july and election day may still be _meta_number_ref_ days away but we ve reached the point at which the mccain campaign is even willing to attack barack obama s remembrance of the nazi holocaust _meta_end_dot_

 speaking today at yad vashem obama said let our children come here and know this history so they can add their voices to proclaim never again and may we remember those who perished not only as victims but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us and who have become symbols of the human spirit soon after the hopelessly tasteless mccain campaign alerted reporters to a news item from a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the mccain campaign wants americans to believe that obama is weak on genocide _meta_end_dot_

 asked for clarification mccain aide michael goldfarb told the huffington post today he says never again a year ago stopping genocide wasn t a good enough reason to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t that strike you as inconsistent not for those of us with cerebral cortexes _meta_end_dot_

 explained a year ago it s not especially complicated _meta_end_dot_

 obama wasn t suggesting genocide is tolerable and he wasn t advocating indifference for murder on a grand scale _meta_end_dot_

 he was simply making the point that if genocidal attacks alone were the basis for a massive military deployments we d have deployed thousands of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops to central africa right now _meta_end_dot_

 that we haven t suggests that genocide or in the case of iraq speculative potential for genocide does not drive u s _meta_end_dot_

 military deployments _meta_end_dot_

 but in response to this obvious observation the mccain campaign has decided obama speaking in israel about never again must be insincere _meta_end_dot_

 there s something deeply wrong with these people _meta_end_dot_

 i know mccain brought in rove s team to run the show but his campaign operation is getting ugly _meta_end_dot_

 the huffpost added update an alert reader emailed me the genocide intervention network s darfur scores report cards _meta_end_dot_

 here are obama s grades on darfur _meta_number_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ a and here are mccain s grades _meta_number_ref_ b _meta_number_ref_ c
