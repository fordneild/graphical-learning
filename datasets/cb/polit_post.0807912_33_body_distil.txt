  by now everyone can see the advantages of ending the race for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 reasonable people can disagree about whether or not this prolonged process is a disaster for the party but if we re making lists of pros and cons i think it s clear that the latter would be longer than the prior _meta_end_dot_

 the question of course is what anyone can do about it _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee gov _meta_end_dot_

 philip bredesen d the policy chairman of the democratic governors association to his credit thinks outside the box and presents a new idea in an nyt op ed today _meta_end_dot_

 as bredesen sees it some kind of mini convention of party insiders wouldn t be necessary just a tight two day business like gathering including one transparent vote not bad but i might quibble with a detail here or there _meta_end_dot_

 bredesen added maybe so _meta_end_dot_

 but here s a slight counter offer why wait until june _meta_end_question_

 the nyt had an item over the weekend about how the superdelegates are feeling antsy but the uncommitted ones don t want to announce their support for either candidate right now _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because superdelegates influential party insiders are hoping power brokers dean gore et al will intervene so they ll be relieved of making an excruciating decision that could lose them friends and supporters at home i m sorry to break it to the superdelegates but this is in their hands _meta_end_dot_

 whether that s in august june or right now these insiders are going to tip the scales in the direction of one candidate or the other _meta_end_dot_

 i think the smart move is to make a choice sooner rather than later _meta_end_dot_

 after all what are they waiting for _meta_end_question_

 this campaign started _meta_number_ref_ months ago there have been more than _meta_number_ref_ debates countless forums and _meta_number_ref_ states have held either a primary or a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 they know they ll have to make a decision but they re still undecided _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 i like bredesen s idea _meta_end_dot_

 compared to the status quo it s very clever and worthy of serious consideration _meta_end_dot_

 but i d be even happier with superdelegates just speaking up now and helping end this process immediately _meta_end_dot_

 as i argued on saturday one candidate is going to enter the convention with more delegates more states and probably more popular votes _meta_end_dot_

 if superdelegates find that compelling fine back obama _meta_end_dot_

 if they find other factors more compelling fine back clinton _meta_end_dot_

 just stop sitting on the sidelines waiting for a miracle hoping to avoid the burden of choice _meta_end_dot_
