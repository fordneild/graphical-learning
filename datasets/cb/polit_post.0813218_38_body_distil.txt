  given every metric barack obama is obviously well positioned to win the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 and yet on tuesday he s going to lose the west virginia primary by a very large margin _meta_end_dot_

 a week later he s going to lose the kentucky primary by a whole lot of percentage points too _meta_end_dot_

 polling is a little sketchy but hillary clinton should win west virginia by about _meta_number_ref_ points bill clinton suggested the other day hrc s margin could be as high as _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 polls in kentucky point to a clinton victory in the _meta_number_ref_ point range _meta_end_dot_

 it s not an altogether pleasant subject but it s probably worth taking a moment to consider why obama just as he wraps up the nomination is going to get his hat handed to him _meta_end_dot_

 mcclatchy takes a closer look at the landscape in kentucky and suggests race is a dominating factor _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is ali alluded to the obvious reasons but didn t want to come right out and acknowledge them _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to put words in his mouth but by virtue of his stated desire to be very blunt i suspect the pollster was thinking a lot of white folks in kentucky aren t going to vote for a black man the evidence is entirely anecdotal but an analysis of the race in west virginia produced similar results _meta_end_dot_

 piece today on why obama is struggling in the mountain state noting local party leaders who worry that west virginians will be turned off by obama s black heritage the lat talked to a farmer who voted for bush but regrets it but who appears more than a little reluctant to vote for the presumptive democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 obama the farmer said just doesn t sound right for an american president the president of the west virginia coon hunters assn _meta_end_dot_

 told the times he rejects obama because of you know who he is i m also reminded of this new yorker piece from george packer a couple of weeks ago about obama struggling to win over voters in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 i thought about all of this after reading an item from mydd s jerome armstrong who has made clear his strong distaste for obama and who argued yesterday that it s offensive to accuse voters of bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 racism is ignorance but unfounded accusations of racism are just as low on the scum radar armstrong wrote _meta_end_dot_

 he suggested that unless obama s supporters have proof of electoral racism they shouldn t carelessly throw the charges around _meta_end_dot_

 armstrong s point is well taken _meta_end_dot_

 unfounded accusations of racism are obviously wrong and it s especially awkward in the context of two democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 there s considerable anecdotal evidence that racial animus is driving voters in kentucky and west virginia away from obama but anecdotes are not data _meta_end_dot_

 my only follow up would be this what else can explain obama s _meta_number_ref_ point deficits in west virginia and kentucky _meta_end_question_

 the states are lacking in some of obama s most reliable constituencies but so are states like nebraska south north dakota idaho wyoming and alaska but obama won each of those contests easily _meta_end_dot_

 what s more looking at county data some of obama s worst performing counties just happen to be throughout appalachia _meta_end_dot_

 unfounded accusations of racism have no place in the political debate _meta_end_dot_

 but if regional attitudes on race aren t keeping obama s numbers down in kentucky and west virginia what is _meta_end_question_

 given obama s otherwise strong position what else explains why he s about to get trounced _meta_end_question_
