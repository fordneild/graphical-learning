  over the last _meta_number_ref_ or so days supporters of the administration s iraq policy have insisted repeatedly that iraq s new de baathification law is proof of long awaited political progress _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain who s been wrong about every aspect of the war for six years said the law is evidence that we re succeeding politically fred kagan an architect of the surge strategy said the law is the beginning of a new era of civil rights legislation in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 over the weekend kagan jack keane and michael o hanlon trumpeted the legislation as a first step in the surge s remarkable success _meta_end_dot_

 condoleezza rice gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker have all made similar comments _meta_end_dot_

 like most iraq related rhetoric from bush and his allies all of this seemed wildly off base _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall noted it s been more or less an open secret that the law is a disappointment and even a sham because instead of a de baathification measure the law actually points to a new and more thorough purge of ex baathists rather than their reintegration into the state and military bureaucracy of course that s the way it seemed _meta_end_dot_

 today the wapo has a very compelling front page item explaining that skepticism about the de baathification law is warranted while claims from mccain the bush gang and their ideological chorts are simply wrong _meta_end_dot_

 actually it s the opposite of all conservative claims about the legislation but the broader point is certainly correct the law held up as progress is actually a step backwards _meta_end_dot_

 something to consider the next time john mccain boasts that we re succeeding politically
