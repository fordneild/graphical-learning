  this came up quite a bit a couple of weeks ago after the annoying bob kerrey brouhaha but it s also been a part of the campaign debate for months would barack obama s ethnic and racial background help improve the united states image internationally if he s elected _meta_end_question_

 reza aslan argues that the chattering classes who are encouraged by obama s potential impact around the world are mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 aslan s point seems incontrovertible u s _meta_end_dot_

 critics internationally care about the president s policies not the president s ethnicity _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a competition between image and substance the result isn t even close _meta_end_dot_

 that is how the post bush war on terror must be handled aslan wrote _meta_end_dot_

 not by re branding the mess george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has made but by actually fixing it and while this is obviously true i think there are a couple of angles to this that make aslan s thesis less persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of this recent piece from slate s fred kaplan who encouraged readers to send him suggestions for improving america s reputation on the global stage _meta_end_dot_

 most of the responses came from foreigners or from americans living abroad and this was the most common recommendation are we to believe given this that electing a black man as president of the united states would have no effect on international perceptions _meta_end_question_

 granted this would not exactly produce epiphanies for jihadists throughout the region but no one s saying it would _meta_end_dot_

 we re just talking about a modest step towards improving the nation s reputation in the context of soft power not hard power second aslan s argument seems to be criticism of obama but it need not be _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing obama has never said that his background would improve america s standing in the world _meta_end_dot_

 indeed aslan s piece didn t cite any examples it instead criticized andrew sullivan and the boston globe s editorial board for making the arguments _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been watching obama pretty closely for a year and he s not talking about re branding he s been fairly specific about policy in several speeches and in his foreign affairs article detailing how he would change read improve u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 one can agree or disagree with his vision but aslan s criticism seems to be directed at obama supporters not obama himself _meta_end_dot_

 i think the point obama backers have tried to make is that his background might help _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the be all end all to a successful counter terrorism campaign it won t end al qaeda recruiting and it won t suddenly make the united states popular in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 the impact in all likelihood would be modest _meta_end_dot_

 but it d be something positive _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin recently put it i n the long run the only way to defeat the hardcore jihadists is to dry up their support in the surrounding muslim world _meta_end_dot_

 and on that score a president with black skin a muslim father and a middle name of hussein might very well be pretty helpful
