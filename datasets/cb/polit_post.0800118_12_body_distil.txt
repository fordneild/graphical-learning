  it s tempting to skip past richard cohen columns just as a matter of habit but today s op ed is so odd one wonders how washington post editors even let it run _meta_end_dot_

 the piece ostensibly is about taking barack obama to task over a misleading statistic he used in a speech _meta_end_dot_

 but the piece starts out badly and goes downhill from there the irony is rich _meta_end_dot_

 cohen wrote a piece about the importance of accuracy and the first nine words john edwards lied about the cost of his haircuts are false _meta_end_dot_

 if cohen wants to raise a fuss about the cost of edwards haircuts that would merely be annoying though it would be consistent with the post s disconcerting obsession with the subject _meta_end_dot_

 instead the columnist emphasizes the importance of getting the details right while making up a lie that never happened _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain example is also bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 yes the arizona senator claimed we were founded as a christian nation and we were not _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not an example of mendacity it s an example of ignorance _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wasn t lying he was just foolishly pandering to the religious right with nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 that s worthy of criticism of course but for different reasons _meta_end_dot_

 if cohen really wanted to throw mccain into the mix he could have at least found some actual examples of the senator s mendacity such as mccain s lies about his criticism of the rumsfeld policy or his spectacular lies about going for a safe stroll in a baghdad market in march _meta_end_dot_

 one gets the impression that cohen who s been around long enough to know better just casually threw in some accusations of dishonesty in the hopes of achieving some kind of balance regrettably he did so a without getting his facts straight and b in a column about the importance of people getting their facts straight _meta_end_dot_

 it s really not a good way to start out the new year _meta_end_dot_

 now if this is right and obama repeated a bogus statistic he s in the wrong no doubt about it _meta_end_dot_

 there have been far more dramatic lies from presidential candidates and this one seems largely inconsequential but would be presidents should strive for _meta_percent_ref_ accuracy regardless of party _meta_end_dot_

 but cohen applies a standard here that doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 i see _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain lied even though he didn t and that s fine because cohen has known him for a long while _meta_end_dot_

 obama cited a bogus statistic and that s worth an entire column because cohen hasn t known him very long _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be a long year isn t it _meta_end_dot_
