  we ve all seen some nasty primary fights but i can t think of any recent examples that got as ugly as the fight in tennessee s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 the memphis area district has a majority african american population but recently elected rep _meta_end_dot_

 steve cohen d who is white and jewish _meta_end_dot_

 his opponents in the area are now distributing a shocking flier painting cohen as a jesus hater _meta_end_dot_

 when reader d l _meta_end_dot_

 first alerted me to this story my first thought was how disgusting at no point did it occur to me to think i wonder what barack obama thinks about this but instapundit s glenn reynolds can be an odd duck sometimes _meta_end_dot_

 his post which accurately described the bigoted flier as rank anti semitism added glenn was doing just fine until that last sentence _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell there s absolutely no connection whatsoever between obama and that crazed murfreesboro minister distributing this ugly flier except that they re both black _meta_end_dot_

 glenn s argument seems to be that obama should make a point of condemning this because an african american preacher is doing something stupid _meta_end_dot_

 but that s ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 as brad at sadly no put it w e can all see where this game is headed no _meta_end_question_

 every week the ole perfesser will find some black guy somewhere who said something crazy and remark darkly about how disturbing he finds it that obama hasn t come out and denounced him yet _meta_end_dot_

 as in if obama really wanted to be a racial healer he d let people know that he doesn t support sexually harassing female employees like isiah thomas does _meta_end_dot_

 heh i can only hope the opposite is also true _meta_end_dot_

 can we all agree right now that john mccain should be encouraged to condemn every stupid thing said by white right wing ministers between now and the election _meta_end_question_
