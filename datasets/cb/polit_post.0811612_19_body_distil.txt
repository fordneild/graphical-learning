  supreme court justice antonin scalia usually shies away from media attention but now that he has a book coming out and interviews might help sell his new product scalia is opening up a bit _meta_end_dot_

 he chatted with _meta_number_ref_ minutes and the discussion turned to bush v _meta_end_dot_

 gore scalia s message _meta_end_question_

 critics of the ruling should just get over it actually as i recall gore didn t have much of a choice florida was led by his opponent s brother and a secretary of state who was the co chair of his opponent s campaign both of whom had decided to cut short the vote counting process _meta_end_dot_

 gore didn t want to make it a judicial question he needed to try to bring some integrity to the florida system _meta_end_dot_

 regardless i m struck by this notion that democrats should just get over it that s easier said than done _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that i m just petty _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hard time forgiving and forgetting _meta_end_dot_

 but every time i hear conservatives argue that we should get over it i m reminded of why i continue to harbor grudges _meta_end_dot_

 republicans threw the political world into turmoil in _meta_number_ref_ by launching an impeachment crusade against bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it was an absurd and painful exercise _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who are still annoyed by the fight are supposed to get over it in _meta_number_ref_ republicans orchestrated a massive fraud in florida and with the help of the supreme court delivered the presidency to the candidate who came in second _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who harbor resentment are told we should get over it bush failed to take the terrorist threat seriously before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 get over it bush launched a disastrous war _meta_end_question_

 get over it bush is rewarding swiftboat liars who helped smear a war hero with a vicious lie _meta_end_question_

 get over it it s not enough for the gop and its allies to engage in offensive conduct they also insist after a short while that we stop being bothered by it _meta_end_dot_

 this reminds me a great deal of a scene in monty python and the holy grail john cleese s sir lancelot storms a castle sword in hand murdering most of a wedding party based on the mistaken belief that a maiden was in desperate need of a rescue _meta_end_dot_

 the castle owner anxious to curry favor with lancelot encourages the survivors of the attack to let bygones be bygones _meta_end_dot_

 as the castle owner tells his guests let s not bicker and argue about who killed whom we ve heard the same message from the right for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 let s not bicker and argue about who unnecessarily impeached whom or who stole which election or who was responsible for which foreign policy catastrophe or who viciously smeared whom to win an election _meta_end_dot_

 the important thing is that we all get over it and look forward _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s wrong to hold a grudge right _meta_end_question_

 maybe it s just me but i find it very difficult to let bygones be bygones _meta_end_dot_
