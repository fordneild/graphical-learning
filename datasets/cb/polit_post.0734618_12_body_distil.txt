  clearly the big news from zev chafets nyt piece on mike huckabee to be published on sunday in the times magazine was the former governor s suggestion that mormons believe jesus and the devil are brothers _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not the only noteworthy tidbit in the article _meta_end_dot_

 a friend of mine emailed me about this interesting tidbit in october david brooks in an otherwise fawning column about huckabee conceded that his foreign policy thinking is thin that was obviously a dramatic understatement huckabee s understanding about international affairs is about as sophisticated as his child like familiarity with energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 last week he didn t know what the national intelligence estimate was _meta_end_dot_

 this week he identified thomas friedman and frank gaffney as his biggest influences on foreign policy despite the fact that friedman and gaffney don t actually agree on anything _meta_end_dot_

 that huckabee is a credible challenger for the gop nomination at all suggests the party has pretty much given up on taking foreign policy knowledge seriously as a presidential qualification _meta_end_dot_

 village idiot on a point unrelated to international affairs _meta_end_dot_

 i m genuinely curious about this _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush showed a similar sophistication when it came to current events and policy basics in _meta_number_ref_ and the political press corps more or less laughed it off as if intelligence was no longer relevant in a national leader _meta_end_dot_

 with huckabee it s happening all over again a southern governor who doesn t know anything about policy is running on his charm his religion and his appeal to far right activists _meta_end_dot_

 political reporters thought it would be rude or more accurately biased to emphasize the candidate s lack of intellectual prowess and we ve been paying a high price ever since _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen this movie before and i really don t like the ending _meta_end_dot_

 post script by the way speaking of huckabee and foreign policy patrick ruffini asked yesterday is the national security party really going to nominate a former governor with zero national security experience to face al qaeda of course he recommended that this tilts the scales in the direction of rudy giuliani who has zero national security experience _meta_end_dot_

 just thought i d mention it _meta_end_dot_
