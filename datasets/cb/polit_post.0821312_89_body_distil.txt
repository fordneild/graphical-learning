  late yesterday after a series of false attack ads from the mccain campaign the obama campaign unveiled a pretty good response ad _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ seconds the spot hits most of the high notes mccain s attacks are objectively false but just as importantly mccain is practicing the politics of the past he offers the same old politics and the same failed policies at that point the ad pivots to obama s policies on the economy and energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 you ll note of course that mccain s ads rarely actually talk about mccain s actual ideas and while i think this is a pretty solid response ad it is fundamentally a defensive response _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is attacking and obama is responding _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait argues today that the equation should be turned around _meta_end_dot_

 is there room in the new style of politics for going on the attack _meta_end_question_

 i mention this of course because while mccain s general election strategy now appears clear do and or say anything to win no matter what obama s team s strategy is less obvious _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly possible obama is trying to stay above the fray now and will get more aggressive in the home stretch _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he ll want his running mate to be the aggressive part of the team _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been a substantive positive issue driven candidate but that doesn t mean he won t go negative at some point _meta_end_dot_

 and if he does decide to take the offensive chait offers a helpful roadmap _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger problem to me is trying to pick which angle to go with _meta_end_dot_

 does obama attack mccain s ridiculous economic record _meta_end_question_

 or mccain getting the war in iraq completely wrong _meta_end_question_

 or his constant confusion about world events _meta_end_question_

 or him running on bush s policy agenda _meta_end_question_

 or his opposition to social security _meta_end_question_

 or his flip flops _meta_end_question_

 or his dishonesty problem _meta_end_question_
