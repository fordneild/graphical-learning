  about two years ago on the south lawn of the white house bush and scott mcclellan appeared together to announce the press secretary s departure _meta_end_dot_

 after thanking him for his service the president said one of these days he and i are going to be rocking on chairs in texas talking about the good old days and his time as the press secretary _meta_end_dot_

 and i can assure you i will feel the same way then that i feel now that i can say to scott job well done after hearing about mcclellan s new book bush might reconsider saving a rocking chair for his ol buddy _meta_end_dot_

 last november mcclellan s publisher released a six sentence excerpt from his book which drew all kinds of attention and raised speculation that the former white house press secretary liberated from the president might burn a few bridges with his former colleagues as a civilian _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like he s done just that and then some _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of years ago mcclellan s predecessor ari fleischer wrote a book about how everyone in the bush white house was great and the entire team could do no wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it was obviously silly and hackish and as a result no one bought or cared about fleisher s book _meta_end_dot_

 mcclellan has obviously chosen a more provocative route _meta_end_dot_

 i still like and admire president bush mcclellan writes _meta_end_dot_

 but he and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war _meta_end_dot_

 in this regard he was terribly ill served by his top advisers especially those involved directly in national security we ve had a few bush administration officials break with the president and his team in fairly high profile ways _meta_end_dot_

 paul o neill john diiulio david kuo richard clarke and matthew dowd come to mind _meta_end_dot_

 but this is clearly different _meta_end_dot_

 mcclellan wasn t just a white house official he was part of the president s inner circle and part of the team that followed bush to washington from texas _meta_end_dot_

 and now he s trashing his old team in a surprisingly high profile way _meta_end_dot_

 one can t help but wonder of course if this is mcclellan s way of trying to save his own skin as the bush gang is condemned by history mcclellan doesn t want to be associated with failure _meta_end_dot_

 of course if he d thought to speak up when it mattered instead of after the fact mcclellan s ability to make a difference might have had an effect _meta_end_dot_

 now it ll sell books but it s a little late in the game _meta_end_dot_

 post script by the way one part of mcclellan s book was left out of the wapo and nyt reports but bears repeating well this is a pleasant surprise _meta_end_dot_
