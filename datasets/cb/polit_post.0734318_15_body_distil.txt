  yesterday the ap highlighted some absurd comments from mike huckabee offered during his _meta_number_ref_ senate campaign when he advocated isolating aids patients from the general public and warned that homosexuality could pose a dangerous public health risk if the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the aids virus we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague from the general population huckabee wrote at the time _meta_end_dot_

 by any reasonable standard huckabee s comments were ridiculous and offensive but at least for his sake they were made _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 now as a presidential candidate he has an obvious course to take claim ignorance and explain how far his understanding has progressed since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it may not be the most accurate tack c _meta_end_dot_

 everett koop and the surgeon general s office explained to the nation that the disease could not be contacted through everyday contact four years before huckabee expressed support for a quarantine but it s still his best strategic option but the candidate who s still surprisingly far from being ready for prime time hasn t yet learned how to respond to these questions _meta_end_dot_

 sweet jeebus it s as if this guy is practically trying to make himself appear foolish _meta_end_dot_

 second he won t recant obvious nonsense from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 why on earth not _meta_end_question_

 there s no shame in saying what i believed _meta_number_ref_ years ago was mistaken for goodness sakes mitt romney routinely suggests what i believed _meta_number_ref_ minutes ago was mistaken huckabee can t even concede making a mistake when it s this obvious _meta_end_question_

 it gets back to a point i mentioned the other day huckabee s easy skate to the gop s top tier is a double edged sword _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand he s been able to quietly sneak up on his rivals who ve been going after one another and leaving huckabee alone _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand now that the race has reached crunch time and huckabee is a credible challenger for the nomination all of the scrutiny comes at once and the former governor has to be able to keep up _meta_end_dot_

 so far he s shown he can t take the heat _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on the wayne dumond disaster huckabee has taken to lying about what transpired _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on the nie he dismisses reasonable inquiries about major news as gotcha questions confronted with obvious stupidity from _meta_number_ref_ he doesn t know how to distance himself from his own mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 does this guy even have a staff _meta_end_question_

 is there no one around to help prep him for these tv interviews _meta_end_question_

 credible presidential candidates just aren t supposed to go on national television and parse the meaning of the word quarantine
