  the last we heard from the white house on the subject of its missing emails one presidential spokesperson was telling the nation i wouldn t rule out that there were a potential _meta_number_ref_ million e mails lost _meta_end_dot_

 we screwed up and we re trying to fix it while another presidential spokesperson was also telling the nation that white house officials have absolutely no reason to believe that any emails are missing it s the kind of clear helpful explanation we ve come to expect from the bush gang _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday we learned that untold millions of emails are gone and they re never coming back _meta_end_dot_

 despite laws mandating otherwise _meta_number_ref_ white house officials routinely used private email accounts for government business and the rnc deleted all wh emails through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove for example sent or received _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ e mails on rnc servers from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and more than half involved official gov accounts worse this is only half the problem _meta_end_dot_

 a primitive email system of its own that created a high risk that data would be lost _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most startling of all the bush administration managed to dismantle apparently on purpose the clinton administration s email archive system which worked just fine without replacing it with anything at all _meta_end_dot_

 so the emails from the rnc servers are gone and the emails from the white house servers are gone _meta_end_dot_

 coincidentally the more important the dates and subject matter iraq war white house criminal investigation the more likely the emails are gone for good _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a reasonable defense for the white house s handling of this i honestly can t think of it _meta_end_dot_
