  slowly but surely bill richardson s campaign has made it more and more difficult to respect his agenda _meta_end_dot_

 as if his frequent talk about a silly balanced budget amendment to the constitution weren t annoying enough over the weekend richardson endorsed holistic and spiritual medicine in his healthcare plan _meta_end_dot_

 so to hear the governor tell it part of the problem with healthcare in the united states is that we rely too much on doctors _meta_end_question_

 richardson believes we have the resources to invest in reality based healthcare and an alternate system of spiritual medicine that isn t peer reviewed isn t subjected to scientific testing and isn t backed up by evidence _meta_end_question_

 i can appreciate the fact that richardson wants to help differentiate himself from the top tier candidates all of whom emphasize their own universal healthcare plans _meta_end_dot_

 but this really isn t the way to do it _meta_end_dot_
