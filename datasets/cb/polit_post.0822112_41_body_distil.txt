  in recent weeks the mccain campaign has unveiled a series of web videos that are created for the sole purpose of generating news _meta_end_dot_

 these videos aren t ads in any traditional sense and won t even be considered for television broadcast _meta_end_dot_

 they are in effect video press releases with provocative messages made to generate media attention and a sense of buzz and invariably it works _meta_end_dot_

 the more outrageous the web video the more the news networks will run it repeat it and talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 the videos about the one and reporters alleged affection for barack obama were as planned everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 that said the latest effort unveiled yesterday may have been a miscalculation _meta_end_dot_

 you ll notice that a few of these democratic leaders look a few years younger than they do today _meta_end_dot_

 my first thought was let this be a lesson to all of us if you say something nice about a republican the republican will use it against you later but as it turns out the dnc s response was both fast and pitch perfect _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t watch clips online seth colter walls has the transcript _meta_end_dot_

 the point s pretty obvious excluding the attack hillary clinton made during the presidential primaries dems used to appreciate mccain s willingness to cooperate and occasional independent streak _meta_end_dot_

 indeed before his metamorphosis mccain had probably earned some of this praise from his democratic colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 but that s precisely the point mccain changed _meta_end_dot_

 the people who used to respect him don t anymore _meta_end_dot_

 those who ve worked with him in the senate have seen up close the transition from independent thinker to republican hack _meta_end_dot_

 indeed thanks to the mccain campaign s new web video we could if the media has any interest at all have a debate about the old mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 the new mccain exploring the ways in which the previous incarnation would find the revised model offensive _meta_end_dot_

 as howard dean says in the dnc s response you know the john mccain of _meta_number_ref_ wouldn t vote for this john mccain this probably isn t the kind of response the mccain gang wanted from its video _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_
