  after john mccain and hillary clinton both ran campaign ads touting their abilities to answer the white house phone at _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 and deal with an unknown crisis it s become one of the more talked about facets of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but exactly how often does a president get a _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 call and what s expected of them when they do _meta_end_question_

 the wapo s michael abramowitz had an interesting front page item on the subject today _meta_end_dot_

 in my experience i cannot think off the top of my head of a snap decision that had to be made in the middle of the night said henry a _meta_end_dot_

 kissinger the former secretary of state and national security adviser _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he said in an interview i think that one should reduce the number of snap decisions to be made that s really the point that seems to have been lost in all the fuss about the _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 discussion _meta_end_dot_

 the point isn t who ll have the snap judgment to deal with a breaking crisis in the middle of the night the point should be who s worked to ensure that there won t be a breaking crisis that requires a snap judgment _meta_end_dot_

 in most instances there just isn t much a president can do anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i had a very simple formula if it affected the life of a u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizen you woke the president said kenneth m _meta_end_dot_

 duberstein reagan s last chief of staff _meta_end_dot_

 but he said at _meta_number_ref_ o clock in the morning unless there is a nuclear holocaust coming there is not much the president has to decide _meta_end_dot_

 what you are doing is starting to put into gear the response of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government on behalf of the president not necessarily by the president based on abramowitz s report it appears that none of the last four president has been woken in the middle of the night to give an order in the midst of a crisis _meta_end_dot_

 in my favorite anecdote it appears that clinton was usually the one making not getting the calls at _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 john podesta one of clinton s chiefs of staff said i would get calls at _meta_number_ref_ o clock in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 the phone would ring the white house operator would say the president is calling and i would be stone asleep _meta_end_dot_

 he would be watching c span in the middle of the night and he would say i think we ought to make this argument i doubt it s going to happen but we should probably put all this _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 talk to rest _meta_end_dot_

 as an argument about presidential abilities it doesn t appear to make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_
