  the tax policy center prepared an interesting report pdf this week noting the key differences between the economic policies articulated by john mccain and the economic policies presented by john mccain s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 there s a bit of a gap to the tune of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion that s trillion with a t _meta_end_dot_

 how does the mccain campaign respond to this _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out hilariously _meta_end_dot_

 douglas holtz eakin mccain s chief economic adviser told slate mccain has certainly i m sure said things in town halls that don t jibe perfectly with his written plan _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t mean it s official got that _meta_end_question_

 if we want to better understand john mccain s economic policies we should overlook what john mccain says about his economic policies _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s official positions don t come from mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias summarized basically the mccain campaign s position is that their candidate should be allowed to produce one set of official numbers for the purposes of expert scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 but when going around the country talking to voters mccain should be allowed to produce a different set of unofficial proposals perhaps made with his fingers crossed behind his back that are designed to trick voters into believing he means what he says while really they re just unofficial proposals he doesn t mean _meta_end_dot_

 or something dug a little deeper _meta_end_dot_

 let this be a lesson to all of us according to the mccain campaign we shouldn t take too seriously the things john mccain actually tells us _meta_end_dot_

 good to know _meta_end_dot_
