  for a change the conventional wisdom and the expectations of the political world were pretty much spot on yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton cruised to an easy victory as expected in kentucky winning by a landslide margin of more than _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama also saw smooth sailing in oregon winning by about _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 none of this was expected to fundamentally change the contest in any way and none of it will _meta_end_dot_

 the results in kentucky were like west virginia a week earlier somewhat disconcerting at least with regards to racial attitudes of the _meta_number_ref_ percent of kentucky voters who said that race was a factor in their decision about _meta_percent_ref_ chose hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in other words more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kentucky democrats are willing to admit that the pigment of obama s skin was a reason they decided not to vote for him we know that these numbers are often skewed downwards because of voter embarrassment suggesting as sullivan argued that there is a core of less educated white voters in the appalachias will do anything to stop a black man being president of the united states no matter what your political stripe this is not at all encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 but the big news of the night wasn t the vote count but the passed milestone with the results from oregon and kentucky obama secured a majority of the available pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign not surprisingly saw this as a major development worthy of celebration and hosted a major event in iowa last night _meta_end_dot_

 the occasion marked the semi official beginning of the general election _meta_end_dot_

 obama stopped short of declaring victory but just barely _meta_end_dot_

 so obama is threading the needle _meta_end_dot_

 while waiting for clinton to step aside obama praises clinton s work and career _meta_end_dot_

 he s not claiming victory he s just moving on letting his insurmountable lead in the democratic speak for itself _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and the republicans meanwhile have become obama s central and sole focus _meta_end_dot_

 while clinton s speech in kentucky offered her rationale for continuing a primary campaign obama s speech in iowa offered his recipe for winning the general election _meta_end_dot_

 the two democratic candidates simply no longer appear to be in the same place _meta_end_dot_

 obama went on to reclaim the word that slowly disappeared from the landscape in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 see if you pick up on the subtlety and so it begins _meta_end_dot_
