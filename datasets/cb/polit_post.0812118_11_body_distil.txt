  we learned earlier this week that an untold number of north carolinians less than a week before their democratic presidential primary have received automated calls suggesting they ll need to fill out a registration form before they vote _meta_end_dot_

 hello this is lamont williams the robo call said _meta_end_dot_

 in the next few days you will receive a voter registration packet in the mail _meta_end_dot_

 all you need to do is sign it date it and return your application _meta_end_dot_

 then you will be able to vote and make your voice heard _meta_end_dot_

 please return the voter registration form when it arrives _meta_end_dot_

 thank you according to one report the calls were directed at black neighborhoods the north carolina state elections board not surprisingly is most unhappy about the calls and has asked the public to help track down the source _meta_end_dot_

 facing south however has already identified the caller _meta_end_dot_

 women s voices says this is a big misunderstanding _meta_end_dot_

 if so it s a pretty dramatic one _meta_end_dot_

 paul kiel spoke with a representative of the group and moved the story forward _meta_end_dot_

 under normal circumstances an aboveboard voter registration effort would start a robo call by saying this is so and so from women s voices women vote and i m calling to but that s not what happened here instead the robo calls used a made up person to leave messages and at least gave the impression that someone might need to complete some additional paperwork before voting _meta_end_dot_

 the whole thing seems kind of odd doesn t it _meta_end_question_
