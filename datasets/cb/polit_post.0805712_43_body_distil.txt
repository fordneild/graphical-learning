  i m starting to think the adulation for john mccain among new york times columnists is making the transition from odd to unhealthy _meta_end_dot_

 last week nick kristof praised mccain for pandering and lying but only because mccain is bad at it _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday apropos of nothing bill kristol praised mccain for being patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 today david brooks demonstrating unusually flawed timing praises mccain for keeping lobbyists at arm s length after a week s worth of evidence proving the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 what on earth is david brooks talking about _meta_end_question_

 to hear him tell it obama has manufactured a wildly irresponsible charge against mccain that has no foundation in reality _meta_end_dot_

 more accurately the only analysis that s wildly off base here is brooks _meta_end_dot_

 reported the wapo added in mccain s case the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his presidential campaign most of them as volunteers seems to some people to be at odds with his anti lobbying rhetoric clearly some people does not include david brooks _meta_end_dot_

 better yet his own newspaper uncovered evidence of mccain s cozy relationship with a telecom lobbyist _meta_end_dot_

 pressed for an explanation most of mccain s story proved to be false _meta_end_dot_

 indeed brooks notes some instances in which mccain challenged lobbyists without noting that mccain took on the reformist mantle after having been caught in the keating five scandal which drew a rebuke from the senate ethics committee _meta_end_dot_

 worst of all brooks simply got some of his facts wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he notes mccain s consistent opposition to ethanol without noting that mccain flip flopped on the issue before the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 he notes mccain s support for campaign finance reform without noting that mccain actually ended up opposing some of the provisions in his own legislation in order to pander to far right conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he notes that mccain led the abramoff investigation without noting that mccain may have used his power to shield fellow republicans from scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 everything in brooks column in other words is wrong misleading or uninformed _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of embarrassing to read it given that an editor signed off on a piece so detached from reality _meta_end_dot_

 maybe brooks can start this column over _meta_end_question_

 this one s a mess _meta_end_dot_
