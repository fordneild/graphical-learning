  if i were to pick a specific date for when the clinton campaign s tactics began to cause real consternation in democratic circles i d have to go with jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at that point clinton had won a couple of impressive victories new hampshire nevada and obama had won a couple of his own iowa south carolina but the landscape moving forward looked considerably less friendly to the clinton team _meta_end_dot_

 feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the date the clinton campaign had expected to end the race looked to be a split followed by a series of obama friendly contests throughout february _meta_end_dot_

 so on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the clinton campaign decided that the michigan and florida primaries which clinton had agreed shouldn t count should count after all _meta_end_dot_

 three months later i still think it was one of the clinton campaign s more noticeable mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 trying to change the rules in the middle of the game is never a good idea and the entire effort looked like an opportunistic stunt _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton campaign co chair terry mcauliffe this might be more embarrassing than for most _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because of what he wrote in his book written last year about his experiences in politics most notably this excerpt from the _meta_number_ref_ campaign cycle _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say mcauliffe four years later has found an entirely different outlook _meta_end_dot_

 here s mcauliffe now oddly enough there were no more concerns about letting rule ignoring states break this entire nominating process now it s worth noting that the two examples are not entirely comparable _meta_end_dot_

 if mcauliffe s book is right in _meta_number_ref_ michigan stood to lose half of its convention delegates _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the state lost all of them _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is obviously a far harsher penalty than the prior which may have some bearing on mcauliffe s position _meta_end_dot_

 but by any reasonable measure mcauliffe is playing fast and loose _meta_end_dot_

 when he s the dnc chairman trying to protect the integrity of the party s rules and calendar he s content to let michiganders watch the convention on television _meta_end_dot_

 when he s the co chair of a campaign that needs the votes of states that broke the rules he believes the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 as ezra concluded say what you will about the political wisdom of the move but the clintonites at one time knew exactly how bad this would be for the party _meta_end_dot_

 they were clear in their opposition to michigan and florida shuffling their primaries and steadfast in their willingness to impose consequences _meta_end_dot_

 the problem came when those consequences collided with their need for votes to say this is about grand principles of democracy and the scourge of disenfranchisement is to overlook the transparent political realities _meta_end_dot_

 this is about expediency and opportunism clinton and her team changed their mind because they need the votes obama and his team stuck to their guns because it plays to their advantage _meta_end_dot_
