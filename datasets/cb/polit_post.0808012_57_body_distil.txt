  the nyt s adam nagourney explains today that the clinton campaign is looking at the landscape and sees a difficult path to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign does however have some key metrics in mind that they hope could make matters easier _meta_end_dot_

 some of these points seem far more plausible than others _meta_end_dot_

 winning pennsylvania shouldn t pose too difficult a challenge for clinton in fact the obama campaign expects to lose the state and has already begun campaigning in post pennsylvania contests his schedule today for example includes stops in oregon and west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 it s those other two breaks that get a little tricky _meta_end_dot_

 discussed obama already enjoys a rather healthy lead which is likely to prove insurmountable _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt piece noted that it creates the awkward dynamic in which obama will probably enter the convention with more delegates votes and states and the clinton campaign will insist that superdelegates back her anyway _meta_end_dot_

 which segues nicely to the third point shaking confidence in obama _meta_end_dot_

 to a certain extent the clinton campaign has already been at least partially successful in this _meta_end_dot_

 with the kitchen sink strategy before the texas and ohio contests clinton was able to boost obama s negatives for the first time since well ever _meta_end_dot_

 party insiders who had begun to think of obama as the inevitable nominee after _meta_number_ref_ straight february victories suddenly started to look at him as vulnerable _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the jeremiah wright controversy that matters _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tough road _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign is seen as taking advantage of the wright controversy the backlash among democrats would likely be intense _meta_end_dot_

 former mondale campaign manager bob beckel said yesterday many liberals like myself who would be happy to support hillary clinton if she earned the nomination would abandon her if her campaign seeks to exploit the wright controversy either in the remaining contests or with superdelegates but does she have any choice _meta_end_question_
