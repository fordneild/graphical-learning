  yesterday s debate for republican presidential hopefuls is thank goodness the final debate before the iowa caucuses on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however with _meta_number_ref_ days between the event and the results of the first contest this was the last chance for candidates to hammer their rivals undermine the frontrunners and draw distinctions with the rest of the field _meta_end_dot_

 i almost wondered if actual blood would be shed on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 but it was not to be _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s event might as well be labeled the hippocratic debate as in first do no harm the gop field seemed far more interested in getting through the last debate without screwing up than scoring points at their opponents expense _meta_end_dot_

 the event s hosts seemed anxious to play along going out of their way to make this the single dullest substance less inconsequential debate of either side this year _meta_end_dot_

 when the audience learned early on that the debate would include alan keyes but not include questions on iraq and immigration we knew this would be a long _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 how bad was it _meta_end_question_

 the biggest news of the event came after it was over when mike huckabee talked to cnn from the spin room _meta_end_dot_

 at least we know what it takes to get huckabee to apologize _meta_end_dot_

 he won t back down on quarantining aids patients and he won t apologize for urging women to be submissive to their husbands but he will apologize to romney for taking a cheap shot at his religion _meta_end_dot_

 good to know _meta_end_dot_

 of course this is not to say that the iowa debate was completely devoid of noteworthy developments _meta_end_dot_

 asked whether americans should be asked to sacrifice to help pay down our debts the candidates apparently agreed we should not _meta_end_dot_

 how generous _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson easily had his best performance as a presidential candidate yesterday including this mini revolt against one of those silly hand raising questions _meta_end_dot_

 haven t debate organizers learned by now that this is a foolish way to ask questions in a debate _meta_end_question_

 in the opening minutes rudy giuliani explained his belief in the tax fairy right now we should reduce the corporate tax _meta_end_dot_

 we should reduce it from _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a major boost in revenues for the government has this not been debunked enough lately _meta_end_question_

 giuliani also had one hilarious laugh out loud moment in response to a question about his shag fund scandal that rudy is quite a cut up _meta_end_dot_

 transparent government _meta_end_question_

 honesty and truth _meta_end_question_

 stop it mr _meta_end_dot_

 mayor you re killing me _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter tried to take a shot at romney saying something about bain capital working with a chinese business which tried to get a defense contract which may have done business with saddam _meta_end_dot_

 it was so weak romney didn t even bother to respond _meta_end_dot_

 you know it s embarrassing when a candidate ignores an attack completely _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain actually had a really good answer about climate change suppose that climate change is not real and all we do adopt green technologies which our economy and our technology is perfectly capable of _meta_end_dot_

 then all we ve done is given our kids a cleaner world _meta_end_dot_

 but suppose they are wrong _meta_end_dot_

 suppose they are wrong and climate change is real and we ve done nothing _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of a planet are we going to pass on to the next generation of americans _meta_end_question_

 it s real _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to address it _meta_end_dot_

 we can do it with technology with cap and trade with capitalist and free enterprise motivation _meta_end_dot_

 and i m confident that we can pass on to our children and grandchildren a cleaner better world republicans will probably hate this but he s right _meta_end_dot_

 watching the debate i kept wondering whether keyes should be institutionalized _meta_end_dot_

 why he was invited to participate at all remains a total mystery _meta_end_dot_

 i d be hard pressed to name a winner but apparently a fox news focus group strongly backed romney _meta_end_dot_

 expected fireworks between huckabee and romney never materialized but there was one noteworthy exchange _meta_end_dot_

 the question was about what the candidates thought they could achieve in their first year in office _meta_end_dot_

 it summarized the last several weeks very nicely romney seems to care about impressing audiences with some semblance of substance huckabee seems to care about fluff _meta_end_dot_

 so what d you think _meta_end_question_
