  in less than two weeks the obama campaign will have claimed a majority of the pledged delegates and depending on the circumstances possibly a majority of the superdelegates too _meta_end_dot_

 at that point according to one report today the obama campaign will feel comfortable claiming victory _meta_end_dot_

 yes the finish line has been static for nearly a year now _meta_end_dot_

 the first candidate to get _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates wins the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 as we get close to wrapping this contest up though the clinton campaign has decided that the agreed upon threshold needs to get pushed back a bit _meta_end_dot_

 reasonable people can certainly disagree about the value of obama declaring victory on may _meta_number_ref_ but to call the dnc finish line phony doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 clinton used it on national television a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 howard wolfson has used the phony number he doesn t accept in a strategy memo _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has used it in press releases too _meta_end_dot_

 and therein lies the problem _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than a little awkward to announce after _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ contests have already been held and after accepting the dnc s agreed upon finish line for nearly a year that the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ threshold the clinton campaign has been aiming for no longer counts _meta_end_dot_

 of course the good news for the florida michigan dispute is that once the clinton campaign packs it in obama will no doubt rush to ensure their delegations are seated at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias noted this morning stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
