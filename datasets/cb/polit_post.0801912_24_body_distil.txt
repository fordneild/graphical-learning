  guest post by morbo today s crazy right wing preacher who s unable to keep his pants on comes from decatur ga _meta_end_dot_

 bishop earl paulk _meta_number_ref_ is the preacher in question _meta_end_dot_

 he s apparently been a busy little bee _meta_end_dot_

 on monday a warrant was issued for paulk s arrest _meta_end_dot_

 two days later he turned himself in to the police and pleaded guilty to perjury _meta_end_dot_

 he was sentenced to _meta_number_ref_ years of probation and was fined _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how did paulk get in this state _meta_end_question_

 the situation is kind of confusing but hang in there because the payoff is good _meta_end_dot_

 paulk had already admitted to having a _meta_number_ref_ year affair with an employee of his church the cathedral at chapel hill _meta_end_dot_

 mona brewer says paulk pressured her into having sexual relations with him telling her the only path to heaven was through his shorts _meta_end_dot_

 the two engaged in this affair from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 brewer is now suing paulk _meta_end_dot_

 paulk has since retired from pastoring the church testifying about this matter in court paulk admitted to the affair and said brewer was the only woman he had had extra marital relations with _meta_end_dot_

 but that was a lie _meta_end_dot_

 paulk was also having an affair with his brother s wife _meta_end_dot_

 that woman clariece paulk subsequently gave birth to a son donnie earl paulk _meta_end_dot_

 donnie earl grew up believing earl paulk was his uncle but a court ordered dna test showed that they are father and son _meta_end_dot_

 so basically then dna ratted out earl paulk _meta_end_dot_

 he lied under oath when he said he was having no other affairs _meta_end_dot_

 that s perjury a big no no _meta_end_dot_

 but wait it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 here s the best part paulk has in the past been involved with an extreme faction of the religious right called christian reconstructionism _meta_end_dot_

 he preached something called kingdom theology which holds that far right fundamentalist christians have a duty to take over the government and fashion a theocracy so jesus will feel comfortable when he returns _meta_end_dot_

 the reconstructionists are so extreme they make pat robertson look like a card carrying member of the aclu _meta_end_dot_

 they believe u s _meta_end_dot_

 laws should be based on the legal codes of the old testament _meta_end_dot_

 literally _meta_end_dot_

 and some of them advocate the proper old testament punishment for certain crimes stoning _meta_end_dot_

 i think you know what s coming next _meta_end_dot_

 under reconstructionist philosophy adultery and unchastity are capital offenses _meta_end_dot_

 the penalty is stoning _meta_end_dot_

 i have some advice for bishop paulk it s obvious that for years you ve been fixated on a certain part of your body _meta_end_dot_

 this might be a good time to switch your focus and begin watching your head instead _meta_end_dot_
