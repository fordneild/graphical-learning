  way back in may in one of the more memorable debate moments of the year john mccain was asked a straightforward question do you believe in evolution it s the _meta_number_ref_st century and mccain is an educated man so it should have been an easy one but he s a republican and he needs to appeal to a far right base that has little use for modern science so he hesitated _meta_end_dot_

 after a pregnant pause mccain said yes the politico s jim vandehei opened it up to the stage i m curious is there anybody on the stage that does not agree believe in evolution the camera didn t show the _meta_number_ref_ candidates for very long but three would be presidents raised their hand sam brownback mike huckabee and tom tancredo _meta_end_dot_

 at the time i was torn _meta_end_dot_

 was it good news that seven in _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential candidates accept scientific reality or was it bad news that three in _meta_number_ref_ presidential hopefuls reject the foundation of modern biology _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out though there was one more evolution denier on the stage who for whatever reason didn t raise his hand at the time _meta_end_dot_

 ron chusid directed me to this ron paul video posted to youtube last week _meta_end_dot_

 here s the key exchange yes in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ republicans were running for president and four of them reject modern biology _meta_end_dot_

 but i still think it s relevant _meta_end_dot_

 for a presidential candidate in _meta_number_ref_ to concede disbelief in evolution doesn t reflect well on their understanding of facts and evidence _meta_end_dot_

 if they reject the overwhelming proof on modern biology how will they deal with evidence regarding global warming _meta_end_question_

 or stem cell research _meta_end_question_

 or a public health emergency _meta_end_question_

 or any public policy that deals with science _meta_end_question_

 lawrence krauss a professor of physics and astronomy at case western reserve university and chair of the physics section of the american association for the advancement of science recently had a good op ed in the wall street journal about science and the presidential candidates in general _meta_end_dot_

 precisely _meta_end_dot_

 science matters indeed reality matters to the nation s ability to compete in the future _meta_end_dot_

 at this point only two of the remaining seven republican presidential candidates mike huckabee and ron paul refuse to accept the cornerstone of modern biology but that s two too many _meta_end_dot_
