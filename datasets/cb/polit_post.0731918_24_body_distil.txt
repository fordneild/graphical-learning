  for the most part news outlets have been fairly responsible when dealing with issues regarding barack obama and race _meta_end_dot_

 it s why i was so taken aback by the absurdity of this piece in the weekly standard _meta_end_dot_

 first a little background _meta_end_dot_

 hans von spakovsky as regular readers know served as a top political appointee in bush s justice department and was a leading player in what mcclatchy labeled the administration s vote suppression agenda when it came to voter disenfranchisement von spakovsky was a reliable member of team bush _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a compliment _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the president decided to give him a promotion rewarding von spakovsky with a six year term on the federal election commission _meta_end_dot_

 slate s dahlia lithwick recently made a very powerful case that the nomination itself is insulting and if senators have any sense they ll reject von spakovsky out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 obama took the lead in opposing von spakovsky s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 today the weekly standard s edward blum argued that obama isn t motivated by von spakovsky s record but rather by the drive to play the race card it s hard to overstate how ridiculous this is _meta_end_dot_

 reality shows otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 take a few minutes and read this piece from lithwick _meta_end_dot_

 to make a long story short von spakovsky has been at the heart of the indefensible right wing effort to prevent eligible voters from participating in elections _meta_end_dot_

 tom delay s re redistricting scheme that violated the voting rights act _meta_end_question_

 von spakovsky approved it _meta_end_dot_

 georgia s re redistricting scheme to disenfranchise black voters _meta_end_question_

 von spakovsky approved that too _meta_end_dot_

 the conservative campaign to fabricate an epidemic of voter fraud _meta_end_question_

 von spakovsky helped create the scheme and execute it _meta_end_dot_

 when a u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney in minnesota discovered that native american voters were being disenfranchised _meta_end_question_

 it was von spakovsky who shut down the investigation _meta_end_dot_

 in the president s mind this record qualifies von spakovsky for a promotion _meta_end_dot_

 but to hear edward blum tell it obama s concerns about the nomination constitute playing the race card why _meta_end_question_

 i don t know blum simply asserts it as fact _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bizarre charge that requires a little follow up _meta_end_dot_

 if blum wants to argue that von spakovsky is qualified and that obama is wrong to oppose the nomination fine make the case _meta_end_dot_

 but blum emphasizes race as the key to his argument _meta_end_dot_

 in other words to be concerned with a controversial nominee s record is to play the race card obama expressed his concerns in a newspaper serving chicago s black community the opposition is about appealing to african american democrats isn t it possible that a senator has considered von spakovsky s scandalous record and concluded he s the wrong man for the job _meta_end_question_

 indeed there are white senators opposed to this nomination too _meta_end_dot_

 are racial politics driving their opposition to or just the african american senator _meta_end_question_

 if anyone s playing the race card here i think it s the weekly standard _meta_end_dot_
