  in _meta_number_ref_ the bush cheney campaign decided early on in the race exactly how they d define john kerry flip flopper the charge was quickly parroted by the media and reinforced the republican campaign s narrative in the first post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ election in a time of war we don t want someone who s inconsistent _meta_end_dot_

 four years later it s the republican who has reversed course on literally dozens of issues _meta_end_dot_

 and now the media has decided that the dreaded flip flops really don t matter after all _meta_end_dot_

 time s michael scherer sounds bored with all the talk about policy reversals _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan agrees that flip flops no longer mean much _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post s ruth marcus argued today that these policy reversals may actually be a good quality in a candidate a sign of welcome pragmatism and evidence of open mindedness marcus encouraged us to not flip out too much about flip flops cnn s wolf blitzer came to a similar conclusion a couple of weeks ago there s nothing wrong with people changing their minds _meta_end_dot_

 we all do it all the time what a remarkable coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 when kerry is charged as a flip flopper policy reversals become the central focus of the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain is exposed as having reversed course dozens of times leading media voices announce on second thought all this flip flop talk is kind of annoying raised a few weeks ago as the self designated keeper of the official list of mccain flip flops i thought i d take a moment to respond to this new more tolerant media perspective _meta_end_dot_

 in short there s nothing substantively wrong with what any of these journalists have argued _meta_end_dot_

 i m very much inclined to agree that there s nothing offensive about a political figure changing his or her mind _meta_end_dot_

 policy makers come to one conclusion they gain more information and then they reach a different conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 that is to be sure a good thing it reflects a politician with an open mind and a healthy intellectual curiosity _meta_end_dot_

 better to have a leader who changes his or her mind based on new information than one who stubbornly sticks to outmoded policy positions regardless of facts or circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 so why do mccain s flip flops matter _meta_end_question_

 because all available evidence suggests his reversals aren t sincere they re cynically calculated for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t indicative of an open mind it s actually indicative of a character flaw _meta_end_dot_

 and given the premise of mccain s presidential campaign it s an area in desperate need of media scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 i won t bother republishing the full list of _meta_number_ref_ that i ve come up with over the last several months i just ran it recently keith olbermann promoted it on monday and i ll have an updated version next week but go ahead and look it over keeping an eye on the ideological trend _meta_end_dot_

 some of the reversals are because mccain is embarrassed by what he used to believe he argued for example that the war in iraq would be easy which looks ridiculous now and which leads him to argue that he knew all along that the war was probably going to be long and hard and tough most of the flip flops though show mccain dropping his centrist moderate credentials in order to be more in line with today s republican mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts foreign policy immigration abortion the religious right the environment detainee policy campaign finance reform _meta_end_dot_

 in every instance mccain was a maverick willing to break with his party _meta_end_dot_

 now he isn t _meta_end_dot_

 the perception people have of mccain is outdated reflective of a man who no longer has any use for his previous persona _meta_end_dot_

 what s wrong with a politician who changes his or her views _meta_end_question_

 nothing in particular but when a politician changes his views so much that he has an entirely different worldview and that new worldview is conveniently necessary to win his party s presidential nomination is it unreasonable to wonder whether it s entirely sincere _meta_end_question_

 especially when there s no other apparent explanation for four dozen significant reversals _meta_end_question_

 what s wrong with political leaders simply saying they ve had a change of heart _meta_end_question_

 nothing just so long as it s genuine _meta_end_dot_

 given the circumstances one would have to be hopelessly naive to think mccain all of a sudden out of the blue just happened to reinvent himself and his policy agenda based on nothing more than a simple change of heart are there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one s mind about a policy matter _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been in congress for decades he s bound to shift now and then on various controversies _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain was consistent on most of these issues right up until he started running for president at which point he conveniently abandoned literally dozens of positions he used to hold _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t just the incessant flip flops though that s part of it it s more about the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 that the media still perceives mccain as some kind of straight talker who refuses to sway with the political winds makes this all the more glaring _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall recently put it mccain is absolutely gung ho and certain that he s right about whatever his position and principles are at the given moment _meta_end_dot_

 but they change repeatedly
