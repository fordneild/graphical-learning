  it s probably safe to assume there won t be a clinton edwards ticket in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in any presidential primary candidates are routinely asked whether they would back their party s eventual nominee no matter who gets the nod _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule it should be an easy one anyone who wants to lead the party s presidential ticket should obviously want to support the party s eventual nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but john edwards apparently isn t ready to make the leap _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure edwards didn t say he wouldn t back the eventual nominee _meta_end_dot_

 he said i m not willing to talk about that at this point and was unwilling to elaborate _meta_end_dot_

 that s disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 but that s really the wrong attitude to take here _meta_end_dot_

 at some point party unity has to mean something _meta_end_dot_

 it s fine to take on your rivals but at the end of the day democrats have to be willing to support democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative is joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 in my heart of hearts i suspect edwards knows better _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ howard dean made some similar noises after john kerry started winning primaries but it didn t take long for dean to come around and do what s right for the party _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully edwards understands that _meta_end_dot_

 dems have to believe particularly in this climate that any democratic candidate would better serve the nation than any republican candidate _meta_end_dot_

 that edwards hostility for clinton has reached the point that this is no longer clear is not a good sign _meta_end_dot_

 as for the republicans tpm notes that tom tancredo and ron paul are the only gop presidential hopefuls who have refused to pledge to support the eventual republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 update chris dodd strikes the right note here i am surprised at just how angry john has become _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the same john edwards i once knew _meta_end_dot_

 of course we should all come together to support the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder which of the republicans john prefers to hillary
