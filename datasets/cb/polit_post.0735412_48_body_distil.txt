  various polling outfits have been asking voters about their _meta_number_ref_ presidential preferences since believe it or not _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and in every national poll for more than two years former mayor rudy giuliani has led the republican field often by quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 it led the political world to give giuliani an awkward title frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 it was awkward of course in large part because it didn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani had extremely high name recognition which buoyed his national standing but in the early primary caucus states his support has been somewhere between bad and awful since the summer _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s campaign has clung to the notion that he could suffer huge defeats in all of the early contests and still win the nomination thanks to the support reflected in the national polls _meta_end_dot_

 except as it turns out that support was very wide extremely thin and now completely gone _meta_end_dot_

 last march the same poll found that _meta_percent_ref_ of republicans had a favorable view of giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 that number now stands at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in other words gop voters aren t just shifting their allegiances as the race gets more competitive they re also looking at giuliani more and are increasingly unimpressed _meta_end_dot_

 josh asks is there any rationale for still calling him the frontrunner i think not _meta_end_dot_

 one other noteworthy trend in republican polls is the growing distinction between faith based voters and everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 religion _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably a predictable result but it s still striking _meta_end_dot_

 it s been obvious for a while that huckabee s ability to rally evangelicals is the key to his support but it s unusual to see this kind of stark contrast those driven by matters of faith are backing the former baptist preacher everyone else is gravitating towards the more policy focused governor businessman _meta_end_dot_

 welcome to the gop s intra party culture war of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
