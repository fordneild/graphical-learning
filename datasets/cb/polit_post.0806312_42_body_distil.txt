  the buzz in political circles this morning seems to be this _meta_number_ref_ second clip from hillary clinton s appearance on _meta_number_ref_ minutes last night when cbs s steve kroft asked for the senator s thoughts on the lies being circulated about barack obama being some kind of secret muslim _meta_end_dot_

 as ben smith noted clinton denied that she believes obama is a muslim but her denial seems something other than ironclad in a season full of rorschach tests i think this one s a doozy _meta_end_dot_

 instead clinton added some qualifiers such as as far as i know as josh marshall put it clinton sounded like she was adding some iffy hedging i d add that were it not for the sensitivity surrounding this issue there would probably be no controversy at all _meta_end_dot_

 but obama is the target of a coordinated smear campaign which has led to widespread confusion _meta_end_dot_

 that some people close to clinton and her campaign have helped perpetuate the lies doesn t help matters _meta_end_dot_

 michael crowley added i doubt this was about anything more than verbal sloppiness _meta_end_dot_

 but particularly given the way people see a conspiracy behind every clinonite utterance hillary should have dispatched this question with one crisp sentence saying it s just not true i m inclined to agree on both points there was probably nothing sinister in clinton s qualifiers but given the context she could have chosen her words better _meta_end_dot_

 that said i thought i d open this up for a little monday morning discussion _meta_end_dot_

 is the story a sign of over sensitivity or evidence of a clinton campaign subtly hoping to keep some lies alive _meta_end_question_
