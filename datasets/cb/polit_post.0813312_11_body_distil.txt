  i think it was a couple of weeks ago when mccain aide mark mckinnon who said he d step aside if obama won the democratic nomination suggested the two presidential candidates are respectful and high minded enough that they could travel across the country holding un moderated debates _meta_end_dot_

 as i understood it mckinnon wasn t making a serious proposal so much as he was making a point about why he likes obama and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it seems like the debate idea is being bandied about quite a bit lately _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt had an item about this over the weekend as well _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush this sounds like fun doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 when one candidate visits an area and hosts a town hall meeting voters get to hear one side of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 if both candidates are there together voters would conceivably be in a position to learn a lot more _meta_end_dot_

 but even putting aside potential logistical issues there are some real downsides to the idea especially as far as the obama campaign is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 noam scheiber noted yesterday i found all of this pretty compelling _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i d also add that mccain is almost certainly a better debater than obama so while both candidates tend to shine in town hall settings it s far from obvious that obama would look better than his rival _meta_end_dot_

 alex massie added all true _meta_end_dot_

 and this no doubt helps explain why the mccain campaign started baiting obama with the idea to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure these events wouldn t necessarily be bad for obama _meta_end_dot_

 if the discussions center on policy obama would no doubt welcome the opportunity to highlight the fact that on the issues people care about most obama is part of the mainstream and mccain isn t _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter mccain tends to come off great in town hall meetings but largely because no one s there to point out how wrong he is _meta_end_dot_

 if he s sharing a stage with obama mccain may enjoy himself far less _meta_end_dot_

 but all things being equal i feel like obama would have more to lose _meta_end_dot_
