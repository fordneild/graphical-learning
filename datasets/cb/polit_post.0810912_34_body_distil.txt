  following up on an item from yesterday john mccain seems to seriously believe he can a eliminate congressional earmarks and b use the savings to pay for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 the first claim is dubious the second relies on poor arithmetic _meta_end_dot_

 note to mccain _meta_dollor_ref_ billion is less than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion but mccain s earmark problem is even more awkward when we consider exactly what kind of funding he s trying to eliminate _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of days ago we learned that economic and military aid to israel comes by way of an earmark prompting the mccain campaign to announce that it would make an exception to his no earmark commitment _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday thinkprogress found another headache for the republican presidential candidate funding for military family housing is an earmark _meta_end_dot_

 oops _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies an important point there s an embarrassing laziness in mccain s approach to public policy _meta_end_dot_

 he starts with a broad basic premise in this case earmarks are bad and then ends with that same basic premise _meta_end_dot_

 it probably never occurred to him to actually check what gets funded with earmarks to see whether he d want to make exceptions or not before making the public pledge _meta_end_dot_

 the comparison is inexact but i m reminded of a _meta_number_ref_ gathering in which mccain explained how he could fix the crisis in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no depth or indication that he cares about details _meta_end_dot_

 haven t we already been down this road with a president who prefers platitudes to policy _meta_end_question_
