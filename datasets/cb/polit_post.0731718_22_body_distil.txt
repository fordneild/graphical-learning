  over the past few months hillary clinton s presidential campaign has had quite a bit of nonsense thrown it its direction but none of it stuck and by stuck i mean the media would try to manufacture a story no one would care and the controversy would quickly fade _meta_end_dot_

 but the story about canned questions may actually prove to be a lasting embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 late friday after a report surfaced from a student newspaper in iowa the clinton campaign conceded a single instance in which a member of a campaign audience was prompted on what to ask the senator _meta_end_dot_

 grinnell college student muriel gallo chasanoff was reportedly pulled aside before an event and asked to pose a specific question _meta_end_dot_

 they were canned she said _meta_end_dot_

 one of the senior staffers told me what to ask campaign spokesperson mo elleithee explained that it was an isolated incident and that the senator didn t know about this in advance _meta_end_dot_

 this is not standard policy and will not be repeated again he said _meta_end_dot_

 fine so the clinton team screwed one up _meta_end_dot_

 it happens _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t the first time a presidential campaign planted a question and it certainly won t be the last _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign got caught owned up to it and vowed not to let it happen again _meta_end_dot_

 no muss no fuss _meta_end_dot_

 except with new details emerging the story isn t going away _meta_end_dot_

 gallo chasanoff also described the process of the planted question _meta_end_dot_

 it s less than flattering to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the staffer suggested this wouldn t be quite good enough because clinton may not be familiar enough with the other candidates plans _meta_end_dot_

 instead he opened a binder to a page with eight questions on it one of which was specifically planned for a college student _meta_end_dot_

 it said college student in brackets and then the question one overeager staffer planting a question is embarrassing but a regular process is a bigger problem _meta_end_dot_

 over the weekend geoff mitchell a minister who recently moved to hamilton ill from iowa told abc news that he was approached this spring by clinton s iowa political director chris haylor to ask clinton a question about war funding _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday huffington reported there was also a planted question during clinton s senate campaign _meta_end_dot_

 now i m hesitant to make too big a deal out of this _meta_end_dot_

 first compared to bush s entirely scripted townhall meetings a couple of planted questions seems like a minor offense _meta_end_dot_

 second clinton doesn t need softball questions her grasp of policy details is pretty impressive _meta_end_dot_

 third clinton gets contentious questions from voters all the time so it s not as if every event is kabuki theater _meta_end_dot_

 but this is still unwelcome news for the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 planted questions are wrong and they know it _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly the details suggest this was part of a common practice not a single accident _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter all of this gives edwards and obama something new to criticize clinton over and in this case they re right _meta_end_dot_
