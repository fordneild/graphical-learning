  every major presidential campaign is going to approach media relations in a different way but as tnr s michael crowley explained in a fascinating piece hillary clinton s team has crafted an aggressive press operation that perceives reporters as a combative enemy army to be treated accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 driven apparently by a combination of fear and disdain the clinton campaign keeps a tight lid on the flow of information pushes back aggressively against media slights and even badgers reporters a bit when they run reports on other candidates that the clinton campaign disapproves of _meta_end_dot_

 for the most part it s been a surprisingly successful strategy _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the few times i ve seen journalists respect someone for beating the hell out of them says a veteran democratic media operative _meta_end_dot_

 crowley notes that clinton s media operation is not unlike george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s in _meta_number_ref_ and as we know that worked like a charm too _meta_end_dot_

 of course i d argue that the campaigns have very different motivations bush aides were worried that he d flub every interview clinton aides are worried that reporters won t treat their candidate fairly _meta_end_dot_

 either way both kept the press on very short leashes _meta_end_dot_

 the tnr piece however is surprisingly value neutral _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign is doing everything it can to control the media s coverage and defeat reporters _meta_end_dot_

 is this a positive development or a discouraging one _meta_end_question_

 should presidential candidates get tough with the press _meta_end_question_

 her ground zero assumption is that a reporter is an asshole a senior aide to the senator told her biographer carl bernstein _meta_end_dot_

 and why wouldn t clinton feel this way _meta_end_question_

 as much as the media loves the clintons for ratings and selling papers the relationship between the clintons and the fourth estate has been pretty awful since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary now looks at the media as an adversary but given what she s seen what choice does she have _meta_end_question_

 indeed greg sargent highlighted a partial list of some of the nonsense we ve seen from campaign reporters just over the last couple of months _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t even include the painfully stupid analysis of clinton s laugh scrutiny of her clothing or john solomon s bizarre front page expose on hillary clinton s charitable donations _meta_end_dot_

 given this the candidate has come to think of the media as adversaries _meta_end_dot_

 what a shock _meta_end_dot_

 given what she s seen i don t blame the campaign a bit _meta_end_dot_
