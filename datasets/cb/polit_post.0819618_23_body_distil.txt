  regular readers know that i ve been highlighting some of the unusually bad coverage of the presidential campaign from the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 it s been striking in part because it s unexpected the ap has not exactly earned a reputation of being the fox news of wire services _meta_end_dot_

 for the ap to do so many poor reports in such a short time made it seem as if the outlet had undergone some kind of deliberate shift _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens it has _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush this sounds like an exciting and encouraging development _meta_end_dot_

 what does cutting through the clutter mean _meta_end_question_

 according to fournier s new approach it includes more first person writing emotive language and abandoning the forced false neutrality he said she said that has dominated ap reporting for years _meta_end_dot_

 as michael calderone explained ap reporters are now encouraged to throw away the weasel words and call it like they see it when they think public officials have revealed themselves as phonies or flip floppers fournier calls the trend accountability journalism and liberating the truth in principle i couldn t be more pleased _meta_end_dot_

 i ve long believed one of the reasons more news consumers turn to blogs is that traditional news outlets refuse to cut through the clutter dems said a republicans said b _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 that s not the media s job _meta_end_dot_

 if the ap wants to change the game i d be thrilled _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve seen the results of fournier s work lately and while the idea may have merit there s a problem in the execution _meta_end_dot_

 wrote an item whether it was a news article or an opinion piece was unclear that said barack obama is bordering on arrogance a bit too cocky and that the senator and his wife ooze a sense of entitlement to substantiate the criticism fournier pointed to not a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 it was basically the republicans uppity talking point in the form of an ap article _meta_end_dot_

 but the ap s coverage has deteriorated since and it goes beyond just the ap giving john mccain donuts and mccain giving the ap barbecue _meta_end_dot_

 there was the slam job on obama that read like an rnc oppo dump followed by a scathing _meta_number_ref_ word reprimand of obama s decision to bypass the public financing system in the general election filled with errors of fact and judgment _meta_end_dot_

 when obama unveiled his faith based plan the ap got the story backwards _meta_end_dot_

 when obama talked about his iraq policy on july _meta_number_ref_ the ap said he d opened the door to reversing course even though he hadn t _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s david espo wrote a hagiographic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece praising mccain s singular brand of combative bipartisanship which was utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 the ap pushed the objectivity envelope a little further with a mind numbing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece on obama being shadowed by giant flip flops the ap flubbed the story on mccain joking about killing iranians and then flubbed the story about mccain s promise to eliminate the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 it s part of a very discouraging trend for the ap that s been ongoing for a while now _meta_end_dot_

 at this point the ap isn t cutting through the clutter it s adding to it _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t accountability journalism it s weak journalism _meta_end_dot_
