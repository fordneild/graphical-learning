  abc news ran an item the other day that seems to have caused quite a stir in some circles _meta_end_dot_

 obama however started naming names pointing to lugar r ind hagel r neb and schwarzenegger who obama said is doing some very important work on climate change _meta_end_dot_

 he added there are things i don t agree with him on but he s taken leadership on a very difficult issue and we haven t seen that kind of leadership in washington the notion that obama would consider schwarzenegger for his cabinet doesn t seem to be going over well with some dems _meta_end_dot_

 my friend melissa mcewan whose work i always respect and enjoy said republicans don t deserve to be included in a democratic president s cabinet and called obama s remarks dumb swopa another blogger i hold in the highest regard added that schwarzenegger has no place in a dem s cabinet _meta_end_dot_

 this is an interesting flap with a few angles to consider _meta_end_dot_

 that s when he mentioned lugar hagel and schwarzenegger not as likely cabinet picks but just as republicans he respects _meta_end_dot_

 the abc news report left out the key sentence _meta_end_dot_

 whether any of those three republicans actually deserve respect is another matter entirely second i ve noticed that this kind of talk has become surprisingly common this year _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards recently said he d want republican for his cabinet and bill richardson made the same pledge _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been looking for similar remarks from republicans pledging to put dems in their cabinets if elected but i haven t been able to turn up any examples _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman praise doesn t count he s not a dem this isn t exactly a hypothetical question why are leading dems vowing bipartisan cabinets but leading republicans not _meta_end_question_

 i suspect it s part of a broader strategy dems hope to appeal to on the fence republicans who may now be open to voting democratic but it s noteworthy that republicans aren t even bothering to try the same strategy in reverse _meta_end_dot_
