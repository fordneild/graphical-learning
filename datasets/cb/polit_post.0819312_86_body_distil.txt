  in april joe lieberman explained that he s open to delivering the keynote address at the republican national convention in september _meta_end_dot_

 if sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who i support so strongly asked me to do it if he thinks it will help him i will lieberman told the hill _meta_end_dot_

 the remarks came just days after lieberman praised rush limbaugh for his love for our country and support for our troops adding rush has a big voice but he has heart that is even bigger at the time the democratic senate leadership didn t seem prepared to do anything about lieberman s antics _meta_end_dot_

 asked whether lieberman s chairmanship was at risk in the next congress majority leader harry reid said succinctly no since then lieberman has not only pushed the envelope of propriety he s effectively become a republican attack dog _meta_end_dot_

 so it s worth noting that reid s perspective seems to have changed a bit _meta_end_dot_

 reid noted that there was a key vote on medicare on wednesday afternoon and lieberman voted with the dems as expected _meta_end_dot_

 of course there was also a series of key votes on fisa that afternoon and lieberman voted with republicans on the overall bill and each of the amendments _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on whether he d give lieberman s gavel to a democrat if the party expanded its majority next year reid said next year will be next year when we get there this is very much in line with what i want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 it s also the exact opposite of what lieberman wants to hear _meta_end_dot_

 so in april lieberman s chairmanship was not at risk at least publicly _meta_end_dot_

 in may lieberman s chairmanship was up for discussion _meta_end_dot_

 in july the majority leader would prefer to just not talk about it at all _meta_end_dot_

 a lieberman aide told the hill in may sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid has made it clear that the chairmanship is absolutely not in jeopardy in the spring that sounded about right _meta_end_dot_

 but as lieberman s republican antics have become more offensive he had to realize the caucus would notice _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman has to see the writing on the wall but he apparently doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 he has about six months before the next congress convenes at which point lieberman will have lost just about everything his role in the party his committee chairmanship the respect of his constituents and his ability to be a key player on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if he ll think it was worth it _meta_end_dot_
