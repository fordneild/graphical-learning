  it s hard to characterize these results on the racial political landscape as encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo said obama s disadvantage driven by racial animus may be offset by concerns about mccain s advanced age but it s tough to quantify the wapo abc poll used for the article didn t ask voters about their comfort level with electing a septuagenarian _meta_end_dot_

 nearly nine in _meta_number_ref_ whites said they would be comfortable with a black president suggesting there are quite a few white voters who harbor feelings of racial prejudice but would accept obama anyway or there are quite a few white voters who are lying to pollsters about their comfort with a black president _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth clarifying only two thirds of whites would be entirely comfortable with a black president meaning about a quarter of whites say they re comfortable with the idea but they re not thrilled by the idea _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to guess these are the whites most likely to be lying some wanted to see the silver lining of these results _meta_end_dot_

 kathryn jean lopez saw the glass as half full _meta_end_dot_

 i wish i could feel as encouraged _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_percent_ref_ acknowledge racist tendencies which is down from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it s only down from _meta_percent_ref_ and the figure among whites has dropped from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lopez alluded to massive improvements it looks to me given the three point margin of error that we ve seen very little progress at all _meta_end_dot_

 similarly while i m delighted that a strong majority say they do not harbor feelings of racial prejudice two angles come to mind _meta_end_dot_

 one some of the _meta_percent_ref_ might be lying _meta_end_dot_

 and two when nearly one third of the american electorate in the _meta_number_ref_st century is willing to concede feelings of racial bigotry that s not good _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the same poll also found that just over four in _meta_number_ref_ think obama s candidacy will improve race relations nearly three times as many as think it ll hurt it sounds like we could use the boost _meta_end_dot_
