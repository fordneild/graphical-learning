  for months any and all criticism barack obama directed at john mccain was about policy differences _meta_end_dot_

 it s become one of the more dramatic differences between the two campaigns mccain would go after obama on personal issues arrogance patriotism etc while obama would go after mccain on substantive issues _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday obama s team mixed it up a bit and started pointing at least one of mccain s more glaring character flaws _meta_end_dot_

 richard clarke who was a top counter terrorism official in the last three administrations also weighed in on the call slamming quick draw mccain calling him reckless trigger happy and discredited there s no shortage of dems arguing if only obama would pursue fill in the blank narrative line of attack he d stand a better chance and with that in mind challenging mccain on his temperament is just one of many possible approaches for dems to pursue _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s one of my favorites _meta_end_dot_

 more specifically i think my friend a l _meta_end_dot_

 is on the right track here _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent added agreed _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said many times that obama seems committed to treating the electorate like grown ups perhaps more than any candidate in recent memory _meta_end_dot_

 there s an inherent risk in this and we ll see if it pays off _meta_end_dot_

 but on the temperament question my only concern is that there are so many narratives to pursue with mccain it s hard to know which to pick and dems can t pick them all _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 and a hothead _meta_end_dot_

 and he s out of touch _meta_end_dot_

 and he s a confused old man _meta_end_dot_

 and he s an angry candidate running a desperately negative campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and he s self righteous _meta_end_dot_

 and he s a hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 and he s given up on straight talk preferring constant mendacity _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously tough to choose since all of these narratives are true but i think senator hothead certainly deserves its due _meta_end_dot_
