  this is almost certainly going to sound nitpicky if not actually petty but bear with me _meta_end_dot_

 it s not unreasonable to note that john mccain continues to make references to a country that doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 at a press conference in phoenix today for example mccain referenced czechoslovakia _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_

 on first blush this sounds like more antagonistic rhetoric towards russia which mccain wants to kick out of the g_meta_number_ref_ which isn t especially helpful _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly russia can t reduce energy supplies to czechoslovakia czechoslovakia of course doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 it split into two countries more than _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has actually been to the czech republic and slovakia since they became independent countries and he s met with their leaders _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain slipped up _meta_end_dot_

 he s _meta_number_ref_ and this is going to happen from time to time right _meta_end_question_

 well there s a little more to it than that _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent noted mccain has made this same mistake more than once during the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 about three months ago mccain vowed to work closely with czechoslovakia on missile defense _meta_end_dot_

 last fall during a republican debate mccain said the first thing i would do is make sure that we have a missile defense system in place in czechoslovakia and poland and i don t care what his objections are to it second before republicans condemn dems for being picky on this let s not forget that in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign when mccain also screwed up czechoslovakia it was none other than george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush who said it deserved to be a campaign issue a guy gets up and quizzes me on world leaders but john mccain says something about the ambassador to czechoslovakia well i know there is no czechoslovakia there s a czech republic and a slovakia but yet it didn t make the nightly national news look i know this was just another verbal slip _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been incompetent about foreign affairs for quite a while and in the grand scheme of things it s relatively inconsequential that he keeps referencing a country that ceased to be in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s said far worse _meta_end_dot_

 but the raison d etre of john mccain s entire presidential campaign is the notion that he s an expert on foreign policy thanks to his decades of experience as a washington insider _meta_end_dot_

 when the foreign policy expert keeps referencing a non existent country it s not unreasonable to mention that maybe his expertise isn t quite as impressive as his campaign and the political media establishment would like us to believe _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way in august _meta_number_ref_ barack obama mentioned the president of canada in a debate _meta_end_dot_

 canada of course has a prime minister not a president _meta_end_dot_

 obama had made a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 what happened _meta_end_question_

 political reporters pounced see here here here and here for example mocking obama s error and highlighting the gaffe as evidence that he s too inexperienced to become commander in chief at the time david frum argued barack obama refers to the president of canada the kind of misstep that would cost a republican candidate for president dearly it seems frum had it backwards _meta_end_dot_

 the media jumped all over obama s inconsequential error _meta_end_dot_

 mccain meanwhile makes mistakes like this all the time almost always with no media scrutiny at all _meta_end_dot_

 how much attention do you suppose mccain s czechoslovakia mistake will get _meta_end_question_
