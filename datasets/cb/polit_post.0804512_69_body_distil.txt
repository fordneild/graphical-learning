  it s pretty obvious that most campaign reporters and much of the political establishment consider john mccain a man of unshakable principle _meta_end_dot_

 it s equally obvious that this reputation is utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 take yesterday s vote on banning torture for example _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly recap a spending bill to finance the nation s intelligence efforts went to conference where dianne feinstein d calif added an important provision mandating one interrogation standard for the entire u s _meta_end_dot_

 government _meta_end_dot_

 the feinstein measure requires the intelligence community to abide by the same interrogation standards articulated in the army field manual which of course prohibit torture _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain this should have been an easy one _meta_end_dot_

 after all he recently argued rather forcefully during a republican presidential debate i would hope that we would understand my friends that life is not _meta_number_ref_ and jack bauer _meta_end_dot_

 life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective _meta_end_dot_

 and i just came back from visiting a prison in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the army general there said that techniques under the army field manual are working and working effectively and he didn t think they need to do anything else _meta_end_dot_

 my friends this is what america is all about that was then _meta_end_dot_

 when push came to shove and the nation looked to the senator take a stand on principle mccain balked _meta_end_dot_

 he was against torture before he was for it _meta_end_dot_

 it s a real profile in courage isn t it _meta_end_question_

 as brian beutler noted the waterboarding section is the reason the president s threatening to veto it _meta_end_dot_

 it s the reason mccain sneaked into the chamber voted with his party against it and sneaked back out marty lederman considers the details _meta_end_dot_

 but that s all right of course because john mccain is a man who believes in principles weak malleable principles _meta_end_dot_
