  six months out those who feel confident about how the presidential campaign is going to play out are probably kidding themselves _meta_end_dot_

 there are too many variables and the race will take too many twists and turns _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the republican establishment is looking ahead _meta_end_dot_

 how confident are they _meta_end_question_

 that depends who you ask _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday the politico s jonathan martin and mike allen reported that republican insiders believe landscape looks bleak for mccain and the gop once optimistic about john mccain s prospects for the fall general election republicans are increasingly concerned that he could wind up badly outgunned saddled with serious deficiencies of money organization and partisan intensity against the likely democratic nominee barack obama a day later the politico s david paul kuhn reported the exact opposite m any top gop strategists believe he can defeat barack obama and by a margin exceeding president bush s electoral college victory in _meta_number_ref_ in some republican circles kuhn explained there s talk of a mccain blowout and today the new york times adam nagourney weighs in siding more with the prior than the latter _meta_end_dot_

 i think any republican who doesn t say panic is in the wind is lying through their shirt said ron kaufman who was a senior adviser this year for mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 the question is is that panic caused by mccain s campaign or lack thereof in some respects or is it the climate i ve been encouraged by how little of that has actually happened _meta_end_dot_

 some of this isn t mccain s fault he s had trouble generating much attention for his campaign while the media shines the light on the democratic drama but nevertheless i m hard pressed to identify any great strides the mccain campaign has made over the last three months _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain has been the republican nominee for months now and i m still not sure what his central campaign message is _meta_end_dot_

 it s no wonder gop insiders are feeling antsy _meta_end_dot_

 it s apparently not helping that the under funded mccain campaign seems burdened by organizational problems _meta_end_dot_

 and in terms of public image the only campaign development that s generated real interest of late is the fact that mccain has surrounded himself with high priced elite lobbyists some of whom had to be fired for controversial client work _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to know if the story reached a broader passive audience but it certainly didn t help solidify the image the mccain campaign hoped to cultivate right now _meta_end_dot_

 what will be interesting to watch is how or whether the republican establishment responds to their discontent _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
