  the vaunted white house communications team starting way back with ari fleischer came up with a simple strategy when it comes to misleading the country if you speak with authority and sound convinced your lies will have the air of the legitimacy _meta_end_dot_

 take the missing white house emails flap for example _meta_end_dot_

 this week the bush gang s lawyers acknowledged in a court filing that it re used backup computer tapes of email before october _meta_number_ref_ meaning that millions of key emails from a critical time period are likely gone forever _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday reporters asked white house spokesperson tony fratto where the missing emails went _meta_end_dot_

 it quickly devolved into a laurel and hardy abbott and costello like routine with fratto lying blatantly though speaking with absolute certainty _meta_end_dot_

 thinkprogress has the humorous clip for crying out loud can t anybody here play this game _meta_end_question_

 told reporters from the same podium i wouldn t rule out that there were a potential _meta_number_ref_ million e mails lost _meta_end_dot_

 we screwed up and we re trying to fix it confronted with reality as described by his own boss fratto said i m not sure what was said on that _meta_end_dot_

 i could tell you today though that we have no evidence and we have no way of showing that any e mail at all are missing look tony fratto was clearly lying yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that s not even open to any real debate everything he said on the subject was the opposite of the truth _meta_end_dot_

 bush allies might argue fratto doesn t know what he s talking about and that s not entirely his fault but that doesn t work at all he was authorized to speak on behalf of the president of the united states on a pressing subject involving the white house possibly violating the law _meta_end_dot_

 if fratto didn t know the truth he has the option of telling the press corps i don t know let me find out he regrettably chose a different path _meta_end_dot_

 if fratto had any credibility left before yesterday he might be in trouble today _meta_end_dot_

 lucky for him that isn t really a problem _meta_end_dot_

 as for the bigger picture fratto s obvious falsehoods were not well received on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 that s a very polite way of saying the white house is lying so i felt compelled to set the record straight
