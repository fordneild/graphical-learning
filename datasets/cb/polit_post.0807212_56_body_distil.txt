  apparently with an eye towards gen _meta_end_dot_

 david patraeus upcoming congressional testimony the president is involved in yet another p r _meta_end_dot_

 push to defend staying the course in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and if he can say that while stomping his feet and pounding the podium someone might actually believe this _meta_end_dot_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 we re probably past the point at which it s useful to fact check bush speeches about iraq but as long as the white house is gearing up for a public relations campaign we might as well highlight some of the president s more noticeable whoppers _meta_end_dot_

 said either bush is confused about the timing of the events in late _meta_number_ref_ or he s hoping people won t remember reality as it happened _meta_end_dot_

 alex koppelman set the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 of course why let the facts get in the way of a perfectly good ruse _meta_end_question_

 it s never stopped bush before _meta_end_dot_
