  guest post by morbo i ve been depressed over alan keyes failure to win the nomination of the constitution party _meta_end_dot_

 what s a presidential race without keyes _meta_end_question_

 the crazed right wing loon who appears not to have a real job runs every year for something _meta_end_dot_

 with his failure to secure the constitution party nod it looked like keyes might have to sit this one out _meta_end_dot_

 but no worries _meta_end_dot_

 alan is in the race _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s running under the banner of the california wing of the american independent party _meta_end_dot_

 students of political science might remember this party as a political unit formed by george wallace in _meta_number_ref_ to promote his segregationist views _meta_end_dot_

 i was surprised to learn it is still around _meta_end_dot_

 check out the photo of party vice chair mark seidenberg _meta_end_dot_

 where can i get a purple blazer like that _meta_end_question_

 and wearing it with that bright green shirt smooth so why is alan running under the california branch of this party _meta_end_question_

 it s complicated but it sounds like some kind of internecine dispute occurred _meta_end_dot_

 right winger david horowitz tries to explain it on his site but it s probably more info than most of us need _meta_end_dot_

 the important thing is that keyes is running although he might not be on the ballot anywhere but california _meta_end_dot_

 lacking ballot access in _meta_number_ref_ states would be a daunting challenge to most candidates _meta_end_dot_

 not keyes _meta_end_dot_

 he ll just have to rely on word of mouth to publicize his super charged campaign and carry him into the white house as a write in candidate _meta_end_dot_

 given his dynamic oratory i have no doubt keyes can pull it off or at least convince enough suckers to give him money so as to stave off getting a real job for a few more years _meta_end_dot_

 as an added bonus alan s running mate is the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wiley drake a deranged california minister who has the habit of praying for the deaths of his opponents _meta_end_dot_

 bust out the tin foil hats kiddies _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s going to be a fun ride _meta_end_dot_
