  several years ago jeb bush and florida republicans created the nation s first state wide voucher scheme disregarding language in the state constitution that prohibits state funds from going to private religious schools and institutions _meta_end_dot_

 the program sparked a lawsuit and the voucher system was struck down by the florida supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 so before republicans and voucher proponents in florida can give this another shot they ll have to change the wording of the state constitution _meta_end_dot_

 that s not exactly easy constitutional amendments require the support of florida s voters and a clear majority of the state opposes vouchers _meta_end_dot_

 a recent poll found only _meta_percent_ref_ of floridians think vouchers are a good idea how do conservatives get voters to change the state constitution to allow for a program voters don t want _meta_end_question_

 by putting initiatives on the ballot that obscure their true meaning _meta_end_dot_

 the florida taxation and budget reform commission of course is stacked with voucher advocates who bypassed the legislature and placed these initiatives on the ballot directly _meta_end_dot_

 the leading proponent on the commission is patricia levesque jeb bush s former deputy chief of staff the executive director of his foundation and a graduate of bob jones university what we re left with is a situation in which conservatives have a choice con voters or convince voters _meta_end_dot_

 in florida they re going with the prior _meta_end_dot_

 it is easier i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 as long as voters overlook the fine print floridians would end up passing a voucher scheme even though they don t want one _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this in part because i m frequently impressed by conservatives capacity for duplicity but also because the florida taxation and budget reform commission which pushed these amendments onto the statewide ballot probably doesn t actually have the authority to force education related amendments before voters _meta_end_dot_

 that is at least the basis for a lawsuit filed friday _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let you know what happens _meta_end_dot_
