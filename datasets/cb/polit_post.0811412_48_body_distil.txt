  in a televised speech in indiana last night barack obama who had been challenging hillary clinton very aggressively of late in pennsylvania mentioned her name just once and that was to congratulate her for her keystone state victory _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast obama mentioned john mccain s name seven times in each instance in a negative light _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times jeff zeleny makes the argument today that this is just part of a new shift obama intends to transition away from the intra party fight and towards the general election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 great _meta_end_dot_

 wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 i m genuinely delighted to hear it _meta_end_dot_

 i hope desperately that the obama campaign means it _meta_end_dot_

 but i hesitate to believe them because they ve said this before and changed their minds _meta_end_dot_

 this ap item ran three weeks ago that seemed to me at the time to be the right idea _meta_end_dot_

 but before long the temptation to respond to clinton s intra party attacks proved irresistible and the obama campaign was trading some surprisingly ugly shots with its democratic rival not the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 in other words i ve heard this before _meta_end_dot_

 does obama mean it this time _meta_end_question_

 can his campaign really start overlooking clinton whom obama aides insist can t win the nomination anyway and begin focusing on the candidate they ll have to beat in november _meta_end_question_

 the more obama quarrels with clinton the more we re led to believe the democratic race is still very much up for grabs _meta_end_dot_

 for the clinton campaign that s the ideal clinton and her team need everyone to believe that anything can happen and criticisms from obama keep her in the game _meta_end_dot_

 why then has obama been playing by clinton s rules _meta_end_question_

 by pivoting to mccain obama starts to put his campaign in a pseudo general election mode which is where he s presumably wanted to be for weeks _meta_end_dot_
