  barack obama campaigned in michigan this week and during his trip he met privately with a prominent muslim leader _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t especially noteworthy candidates meet with prominent religious leaders frequently from a variety of faiths in communities nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 no one cared _meta_end_dot_

 no one that is until debbie schlussel one of the more unhinged members of the conservative blogosphere argued the day after the obama meeting barack obama claims he s against hamas and hezbollah and is offended by president bush s speech in israel about obama s ethos of appeasement so why is he meeting with one of hezbollah s most important imams and agents in america imam hassan qazwini _meta_end_question_

 what was said _meta_end_question_

 i think we can do the math schlussel went on to accuse qazwini without proof of being an agent of the iranian government and a supporter of palestinian homicide bombings hamas and hezbollah she added that the wednesday meeting says a lot about the company obama keeps and why he shouldn t be president schlussel also quoted the detroit times free press article noting the obama meeting but omitted the one sentence that undermined her vacuous smear _meta_end_dot_

 yep this allegedly radical terrorist supporting agent of iran is so dangerous he s been able to hang out with george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 schlussel s attack was widely parroted by the far right with the usual suspects charactering the obama meeting as something scandalous _meta_end_dot_

 one argued bho isn t even officially the democratic nominee yet and already he s meeting terrorist supporters and iran by proxy and none of them though to click the link and read qazwini has also met several times with president bush and other elected officials better yet oliver willis posted some photos of qazwini hanging out with bush including one in which the president gives the imam a little smooch on the cheek _meta_end_dot_

 as the far right slips deeper into madness as the year goes on the vitriol of their attacks rises keep this incident in mind _meta_end_dot_

 these folks just don t know what they re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 they ve replaced reason with rage _meta_end_dot_
