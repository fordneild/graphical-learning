  after yesterday s mind numbing inanity about tire gauges yes in the midst of the most critical presidential election in a generation republicans have made tire gauges a central focus of a presidential race i m hoping we can begin to move on to something at least resembling substance _meta_end_dot_

 but before we do it s worth noting that barack obama was not only right about the value of routine auto maintenance he was also right about the added efficiency benefits _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly recap obama mentioned to voters in missouri that there are things individuals can do to help conserve energy including bringing their cars in for regular tune ups and keeping their tires properly inflated _meta_end_dot_

 he added that the amount of energy to be saved by routine auto maintenance is comparable to the savings we d get from the gop s coastal drilling policy _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign and unhinged conservatives everywhere began to argue that keeping tires inflated was the sum total of obama s energy policy which of course is insane _meta_end_dot_

 to a lesser extent some on the right argued that obama had exaggerated the potential efficiency benefits associated with tire care _meta_end_dot_

 the first point obviously is demonstrably ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 the second point it turns out isn t true either _meta_end_dot_

 time s michael grunwald sets the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 it creates an odd dynamic conservative republicans want americans to believe there s nothing individuals can do they should just wait for the government to allow additional coastal drilling _meta_end_dot_

 the ap added the department of energy estimates that keeping tires properly inflated can help improve gas mileage by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and the notion that inflated tires represents the totality of obama s policy is plainly false _meta_end_dot_

 i was talking to a friend of mine yesterday about all of this and he said i was overly concerned with facts and truths _meta_end_dot_

 republicans win elections because they don t care in a case like this the only thing anyone will remember is the stunt prop not the fact that they were blatantly lying and blatantly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that may very well be _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it probably points to a vicious cycle republicans make up a lie _meta_end_dot_

 we point out how insane the lie is and feel better about being smarter than republicans _meta_end_dot_

 voters not knowing better believe the lie _meta_end_dot_

 satisfied with the reward republicans feel encouraged to make up a new lie which again leads us to point out how insane the lie is _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the lesson to be learned here is that dems if they want to win need to lie more _meta_end_question_
