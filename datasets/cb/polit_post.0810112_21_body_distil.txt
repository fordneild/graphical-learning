  in _meta_number_ref_ tv preacher pat robertson launched a republican presidential campaign predicated on a vaguely theocratic right wing platform _meta_end_dot_

 he actually fared well in a couple of contests he even came in second in the iowa caucuses ahead of george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush before a poor showing on super tuesday forced him from the race _meta_end_dot_

 but robertson didn t just seek votes on the campaign trail he collected names and addresses _meta_end_dot_

 indeed before he even launched his campaign he told his supporters that he d only run if _meta_number_ref_ million people signed on as campaign volunteers _meta_end_dot_

 this of course created quite a voter list of conservative evangelicals which robertson used to create the christian coalition a year after ending his presidential bid _meta_end_dot_

 robertson has since become a laughingstock and the christian coalition barely exists but by using his campaign lists robertson was able to create a political powerhouse _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense mike huckabee has the same idea _meta_end_dot_

 jerry falwell died last year james dobson isn t as active as he was and robertson is generally perceived as a clown leaving a vacancy among religious right leaders _meta_end_dot_

 why not huckabee _meta_end_question_

 there s been quite a bit of talk in recent months about whether the religious right as a movement is dead _meta_end_dot_

 i can see the argument from both sides but the bottom line for me is that the rank and file people who make up the religious right the ones who watch the _meta_number_ref_ club listen to dobson s radio show etc _meta_end_dot_

 haven t gone away _meta_end_dot_

 the christian coalition has faded and some of the lesser known groups haven t grown in stature or size but the group s members are still out there believing in a right wing theocratic agenda _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee who probably recognizes this may intend to stand in the gap so to speak and be a pat robertson for a new generation _meta_end_dot_

 he s even gone hollywood _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hunch we ll be hearing quite a bit from huckabee in the coming months _meta_end_dot_
