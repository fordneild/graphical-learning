  obviously presidential candidates aren t responsible for comments made by their supporters _meta_end_dot_

 candidates are however responsible for showing a little class _meta_end_dot_

 it s apparently something that john mccain has forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 at a campaign event in south carolina a mccain backer stood up to ask the senator how do we beat the bitch in response mccain said we have our differences with our democratic rivals but i believe in treating people with respect _meta_end_dot_

 it s why i don t refer to women as bitches even when i disagree with them _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure all of us believe we can debate the serious issues of the day without name calling and degrading language no no i m just kidding _meta_end_dot_

 he actually responded that s an excellent question just this morning the nyt s david brooks wrote a gushing love letter to mccain praising him as an honorable man of character _meta_end_dot_

 if there wasn t so much evidence to the contrary it might be persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 yes mccain couldn t even be gracious about his political opponents without using the grammatically wrong democrat party i suppose the natural response from mccain backers is that he didn t want to repudiate a campaign supporter during an event _meta_end_dot_

 but just a few days ago mccain repudiated his own mother on national television when she made anti mormon comments about mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 he went out of his way to make clear twice that he didn t agree with his mother s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 but when confronted with a supporter who calls hillary clinton a bitch mccain thinks that s excellent stay classy john mccain _meta_end_dot_
