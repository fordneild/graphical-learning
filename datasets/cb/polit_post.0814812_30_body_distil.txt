  one gets the distinct impression that bush and mccain both of whom announced their unyielding opposition to a bipartisan expansion of the gi bill are a little touchy on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 given how wrong they are i guess this isn t especially surprising _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the new york times published a hard hitting editorial questioning the white house s line on the gi bill _meta_end_dot_

 it made the accurate argument that the president and his allies don t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 in response a livid white house blasted the nyt calling the editorial misleading and insisting that it irresponsibly distorts the president s position _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough the bush gang didn t point to any specific falsehoods in the times piece and instead relied on the already debunked retention argument _meta_end_dot_

 times editorial page editor andy rosenthal said it was puzzling why the white house attacked the editorial _meta_end_dot_

 we said bush opposes the webb bill rosenthal said _meta_end_dot_

 he opposes the webb bill _meta_end_dot_

 i don t understand what s misleading about it mccain seems just as sensitive on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 sounded pretty defensive _meta_end_dot_

 why mccain continues to repeat this line is a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 he s fallen in this ditch and he s decided to keep on digging _meta_end_dot_

 as the nyt editorial noted ironically last month during a nationally televised interview mccain was asked what could be done to help alleviate the strain placed on u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops during the war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain responded by saying the government should do more to boost recruiting o ne of the things we ought to do is provide them significant educational benefits in return for serving and yet here s mccain continuing to argue that we can t possibly make the educational benefits for veterans too generous _meta_end_dot_

 as digby put it right _meta_end_dot_

 we should be generous but let s not go crazy _meta_end_dot_

 those bastards who think they deserve to have the government pay for their college after just a few years in uniform simply don t deserve it _meta_end_dot_

 sure they may put themselves in the line of fire in iraq or afghanistan for a couple of tours and maybe they work for peanuts and their families are on food stamps while they do it _meta_end_dot_

 but that s no reason for them to cheat the taxpayers by taking a college scholarship when they are needed indefinitely in the war zones _meta_end_dot_

 they re nothing but a bunch o big babies
