  way back in april the office of special counsel launched a broad investigation into karl rove s political activities with particular attention on the prosecutor purge rnc emails and fairly obvious hatch act violations in which rove s office politicized various federal agencies _meta_end_dot_

 we will take the evidence where it leads us scott bloch head of the office of special counsel and a presidential appointee told reporters _meta_end_dot_

 we will not leave any stone unturned at the time it seemed like encouraging news _meta_end_dot_

 after all the osc has a lot of tools at its disposal including subpoena power _meta_end_dot_

 paul light a new york university expert on the executive branch said of bloch s probe this is a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 it is a significant moment for the administration and karl rove well it should have been anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than a little discouraging that the investigator is himself under investigation and the special counsel looking into a potential cover up appears to have engaged in his own cover up _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually a funny story _meta_end_dot_

 bloch claims that he contacted the private pc help service bypassing his own agency s computer technicians to deal with a virus that had control of his computer _meta_end_dot_

 he apparently asked the technicians to do a seven level wipe which as the wsj reported makes it nearly impossible for forensics experts to restore the data later while geeks on call was there he also directed the technicians to wipe laptops used by his two top political deputies _meta_end_dot_

 bloch used tax dollars to pay for all of this and the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ receipt makes no mention of a virus _meta_end_dot_

 jeff phelps who runs washington s geeks on call franchise said it would be unusual to address a virus problem by wiping a hard drive _meta_end_dot_

 we don t do a seven level wipe for a virus he said _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets funnier _meta_end_dot_

 additional alleged wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 but what about career officials at the osc _meta_end_question_

 maybe they can ensure a legitimate investigation of the bush white house _meta_end_question_

 maybe except when bloch took over the office he and his deputies forced out or transferred many of the osc s top officials _meta_end_dot_

 this is as david corn put it a while back a dizzying situation remember these are the guys who were going to restore honor and dignity to the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost comical in hindsight _meta_end_dot_
