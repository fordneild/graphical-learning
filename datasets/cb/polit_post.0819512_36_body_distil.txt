  fundraising for a presidential library has always been controversial in part because unlike contributions to u s _meta_end_dot_

 political campaigns donations to libraries can come from foreign sources and are easier to conceal _meta_end_dot_

 but this kind of corruption is striking even by the bush administration s standards _meta_end_dot_

 specifically payne tells a kazakh politician he knew as eric dos that payne would come up with the exact budget which would be somewhere between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with about a third of it going directly to the bush library the contribution would be a show of we re interested we re your friends we re still friends in the same video payne asks the kazakh politician who does he want to meet with in washington when dos mentions bush and cheney payne responded i think that some things could be done _meta_end_dot_

 i think that the family children whatever should probably look at making a contribution to the bush library _meta_end_dot_

 it would be like maybe a couple of hundred thousand dollars or something like that not a huge amount but enough to show that they re serious so was payne basically selling access to top bush administration officials _meta_end_question_

 it sure sounds like it _meta_end_dot_

 explained currently mr _meta_end_dot_

 payne assists the white house as a senior advance representative traveling internationally in advance of and with president bush and vice president cheney second when payne talks in the video about having dos s friend buy access to administration officials he s talking about askar akayev the former president kyrgyzstan who is currently in exile in moscow after being ousted from power three years ago in a revolution when the country s citizens became outraged by alleged corruption _meta_end_dot_

 it paints an even more depressing picture a close bush ally is not only helping sell access in exchange for donations to bush s library he s also doing so by making arrangements with a very unsavory character _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite a story _meta_end_dot_

 if this were _meta_number_ref_ instead of _meta_number_ref_ the video alone would be enough to spark an investigation from a special prosecutor _meta_end_dot_
