  we ve long been aware of the _meta_number_ref_ yoo memo written by john yoo then a top official in the justice department s office of legal counsel and the almost laughably expansive views the memo takes on presidential authority _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter we ve also known that yoo effectively argued that the administration could break the law on a whim just so long as the president was using his authority as commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 but it s one thing to know about the yoo memo it s another to actually see it _meta_end_dot_

 nixon once argued when the president does it that means that it s not illegal it s since become something of a punchline but the yoo memo made the tenet official government policy so long as administration officials were trying to defend the country they need not concern themselves with the law _meta_end_dot_

 now there s a good phrase to help capture the bush administration s appreciation for the rule of law it was a law free zone emily bazelon also noted kevin added the memos themselves are available online here s part _meta_number_ref_ and here s part _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 read em and weep in this case literally _meta_end_dot_
