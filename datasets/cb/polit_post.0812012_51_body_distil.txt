  john mccain s stated position repeated over and over again throughout the campaign is that he s willing to leave u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq up to a century so long as we re not taking major casualties _meta_end_dot_

 he compares this to a presence along the lines of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops who remain in korea a half century after the war there _meta_end_dot_

 there s no shortage of problems associated with such an approach _meta_end_dot_

 first it s based on truly ridiculous assumptions _meta_end_dot_

 second it wouldn t work _meta_end_dot_

 and third as sam stein reminds us mccain has frequently disagreed with his own vision _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind mccain _meta_number_ref_ believes those of us who agree with mccain _meta_number_ref_ are terrorist sympathizing defeatists _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that the evolution of mccain s thinking on a permanent u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop presence in iraq has taken a surprising number of twists and turns _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain reversed course and embraced the korea model for a long term military presence _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain reversed course again saying the korean analogy doesn t work and shouldn t be followed _meta_end_dot_

 e ventually i think because of the nature of the society in iraq and the religious aspects of it that america eventually withdraws mccain told charlie rose last fall _meta_end_dot_

 and in _meta_number_ref_ mccain reversed course yet again deciding that we should be prepared to leave troops in iraq even if it means _meta_number_ref_ years or more _meta_end_dot_

 at each step mccain was not only convinced that he was absolutely right but dismissed anyone who dared to disagree with him as uninformed and unreliable _meta_end_dot_

 now i should clarify that the point here is not just to embarrass mccain by exposing a spectacular series of flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 rather the point is to highlight the fact that mccain apparently doesn t have any idea what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 he does _meta_number_ref_ degree turns without explanation and then insists that he s been consistent the entire time _meta_end_dot_

 noting mccain s wholesale reversals on tax policies over the last _meta_number_ref_ years josh marshall mentioned the other day on taxes mccain changed his mind four times in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 on long term troop presence in iraq mccain changed his mind four times in four years _meta_end_dot_

 remind us again campaign reporters about mccain s consistency and straight talk
