  guest post by morbo the neo creationists who espouse intelligent design have hit a rough patch _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ they lost a federal lawsuit over the teaching of id in a pennsylvania public school _meta_end_dot_

 expelled no intelligence allowed the documentary that was supposed to put id on the national stage was a critical flop and commercial failure _meta_end_dot_

 id advocates claim to be sophisticated thinkers promoting cutting edge science _meta_end_dot_

 they re not and just behind them lurk a band of knuckle dragging young earth creationists who keep doing embarrassing things like opening multi million museums showing dinosaurs and humans strolling around side by side _meta_end_dot_

 all that s missing is fred flintstone yelling willllllma what s an id advocate to do _meta_end_question_

 how about launch a crude personal attack against a prominent critic _meta_end_question_

 sure that always works _meta_end_exclamation_

 the target in this case is barbara forrest coauthor of the book creationism s trojan horse the wedge of intelligent design _meta_end_dot_

 in the book forrest and paul r _meta_end_dot_

 gross rip the mask off the id charade proving that it s all about religion not science _meta_end_dot_

 that really annoyed the id backers _meta_end_dot_

 a university professor forrest lives and teaches in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 recently she has been speaking out against a proposed law there that would allow teachers to use supplemental materials when discussing evolution so as to promote academic freedom this is the latest stunt from the id crowd _meta_end_dot_

 i have to admit it s pretty clever _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case it s not _meta_end_dot_

 would we waste time teaching our children alternatives to the germ theory of disease _meta_end_question_

 why bother offering supplemental material critical of the existence of gravity _meta_end_question_

 should we allow criticism of the history of the holocaust in the classroom _meta_end_question_

 after all some cranks write books saying it never happened _meta_end_dot_

 shouldn t our children hear both sides _meta_end_question_

 the discovery institute the nation s leading organization pushing id is apoplectic over forrest _meta_end_dot_

 recently the institute issued an entire paper attacking her _meta_end_dot_

 among their charges they note that forrest is gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 non religious _meta_end_dot_

 she sits on the board of the new orleans secular humanist association _meta_end_dot_

 so let me get this straight if anyone has the temerity to point out that phillip e _meta_end_dot_

 johnson a former law professor who almost single handedly launched the id movement once pointed out that his goal is to use id to bring people to the truth of jesus christ that person is a religious bigot who impugns the motives of the discovery institute _meta_end_dot_

 yet it s perfectly acceptable for the institute to attack forrest for her lack of belief _meta_end_dot_

 the discovery institute promotes lousy science and makes a sloppy attempt to dress up its fundamentalism in an ill fitting lab coat _meta_end_dot_

 that s bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 but there s another reason why its supplemental materials must be kept out of our public schools the group plays dirty and is unethical _meta_end_dot_

 it sets a poor example for children everywhere _meta_end_dot_
