  after playing very little role in the election for the better part of _meta_number_ref_ race racism and racially charged rhetoric has suddenly become one of the central focuses of the democratic presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 to see this unfold is painful and disappointing to put it mildly _meta_end_dot_

 given what we ve seen particularly over the last couple of weeks the questions for the political world are obvious _meta_end_dot_

 are comments with racial subtexts harmless incidents that are being blown out of proportion or are they part of a deliberate divisive campaign strategy _meta_end_question_

 are the incidents that have drawn attention random unrelated data points or part of a calculated strategy _meta_end_question_

 clearly barack obama s campaign has an opinion on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 maybe maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it s probably a mistake to lump all the controversies together to create one big mess _meta_end_dot_

 some of the incidents remarks seem outrageous while others appear to have been misconstrued _meta_end_dot_

 it s helpful to consider them in isolation before stepping back to see the big picture _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton referred to obama s movement as a fairly tale _meta_number_ref_ horton this one has been misconstrued repeatedly _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the full context the former president described obama s reputation as an opponent of the war in iraq as a fairly tale that in and of itself is a debatable point but there was no racial subtext _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton downplayed the significance of martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hortons i realize the original quote has been taken from context in a variety of instances but even in its full context i think clinton tried to make a point with some poorly chosen words _meta_end_dot_

 andrew cuomo s shuck and jive comments _meta_number_ref_ hortons it s questionable and the context helps make cuomo look a little better but he probably should have realized how comments like that could be construed _meta_end_dot_

 bob kerrey s muslim and madrassa comments _meta_number_ref_ hortons it s hard to defend kerrey on this _meta_end_dot_

 billy shaheen s drug dealer comments _meta_number_ref_ hortons dumb dumb dumb _meta_end_dot_

 bob johnson s drug dealer comments _meta_number_ref_ hortons dumb dumb dumb _meta_end_dot_

 sergio bendixen a top clinton pollster on latino and black communities _meta_number_ref_ hortons bendixen conceded the other day the hispanic voter and i want to say this very carefully has not shown a lot of willingness or affinity to support black candidates he s playing with fire given the environment _meta_end_dot_

 hillary referred to spadework on the today show _meta_number_ref_ horton it s a real stretch _meta_end_dot_

 clinton aide on obama as an imaginary hip black friend incomplete an anonymous clinton adviser explained what he she sees as the difference between hillary supporters and obama supporters if you have a social need you re with hillary the aide said _meta_end_dot_

 if you want obama to be your imaginary hip black friend and you re young and you have no social needs then he s cool i d give it the full _meta_number_ref_ hortons but i have no idea whether the person is a close aide or a tangential adviser bill clinton referred to obama as a kid _meta_number_ref_ horton donna brazille was emphasizing this one last week but i think the subtext dealt with youth and inexperience not race _meta_end_dot_

 still given that obama is older now than bill clinton was in _meta_number_ref_ it s an odd comment but that s another story for another day in the big picture there certainly are a lot of these incidents but whether it s part of a pattern or not is i suppose in the eye of the beholder _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add this the sooner we get past this the better it will be for the candidates the campaigns and the party _meta_end_dot_
