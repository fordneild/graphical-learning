  the nyt notes today that the democratic leaders in the senate are aware of the disgust and disappointment over joe lieberman but they re not especially concerned about it _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t come as too big a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman told the hartford courant this month i can tell you sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid had talked to me a few times and said he knows there will be talk if we get more than _meta_number_ref_ democrats next year _meta_end_dot_

 as far as he is concerned i will retain my seniority et cetera no matter how many democrats there are next year asked on tuesday whether lieberman s chairmanship was at risk in the next congress reid said succinctly no i continue to think this is absurd in part because lieberman is a lousy committee chairman and in part because a larger democratic majority would mean we wouldn t need to placate him anymore _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless at the risk of sounding picky the notion that lieberman is with us on everything but the war is not only wrong it s foolish _meta_end_dot_

 as brookings thomas e _meta_end_dot_

 mann a non partisan political scholar told the times it s one thing to have a principled position on an issue at odds with that of your party _meta_end_dot_

 it s another to become the champion of the other party s nominee in a presidential election even if we put aside the many issues on which lieberman has ignored the party s interests social security bush s judicial nominees the white house faith based initiative tort reform school vouchers the blame hollywood movement consider that just this week lieberman said he s considering giving the keynote address at the republican national convention and said he thinks it s reasonable to ask whether the likely democratic presidential nominee is a marxist ed kilgore hardly a lefty ideologue argued the other day i don t doubt that lieberman has been good friends with reid durbin schumer and others in the party leadership for years _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been to each other s homes they ve traveled together their families know one another _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there s genuine affection between them on a personal level _meta_end_dot_

 but painful though it may be there s a time for putting those personal feelings aside and that time is upon us _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman has betrayed his party and his constituents to reward him for his behavior sets a dangerous precedent and weakens the party when it needs to be strong _meta_end_dot_
