  first up from the god machine this week is a poll that didn t get a lot of attention but was actually pretty important _meta_end_dot_

 a quinnipiac university national poll released on thursday covered quite a bit of ground when it came to culture war issues and perhaps most importantly given the recent campaign discussion produced some interesting data on faith based federal funding _meta_end_dot_

 this is interesting for a couple of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first that _meta_percent_ref_ of americans don t want faith based groups to get social service grants is a surprisingly high number _meta_end_dot_

 there s a perception which i ll admit to buying into on occasion that these kinds of partnerships and contracts which have been around for years are overwhelmingly popular _meta_end_dot_

 a poll like this suggests there remains some discomfort about mixing church and state which i find encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 but that second part of the question is even more striking _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt s bob herbert in a misguided attack on barack obama recently argued that obama is promising not just to maintain the bush program of investing taxpayer dollars in religious based initiatives but to expand it that s simply not true obama s policy is premised on key safeguards that bush s program intentionally sought to remove _meta_end_dot_

 and at the top of this list was religious discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes groups that receive public funds can t discriminate when hiring employees to do the social service work _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain just a week ago said the exact opposite insisting that faith based organizations should get funding and discriminate in hiring with tax dollars _meta_end_dot_

 so on this issue _meta_percent_ref_ of americans prefer obama s approach while _meta_percent_ref_ prefer mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 more religious trouble for mccain a catholic group has written to john mccain to ask him to remove deal hudson from the catholics for mccain national steering committee because of allegations that in _meta_number_ref_ hudson solicited sex from an _meta_number_ref_ year old woman who was a student in one of his classes at fordham university _meta_end_dot_

 guns _meta_number_ref_ god an oklahoma church canceled a controversial gun giveaway for teenagers at a weekend youth conference _meta_end_dot_

 windsor hills baptist had planned to give away a semiautomatic assault rifle until one of the event s organizers was unable to attend _meta_end_dot_

 the church s youth pastor bob ross said it s a way of trying to encourage young people to attend the event as if the dispute in south carolina weren t enough now license plate controversies are spreading to kentucky the official kentucky state motto is united we stand divided we fall but that s not the slogan that gov _meta_end_dot_

 steve beshear is proposing for a new alternative license plate _meta_end_dot_

 according to the louisville courier journal beshear will push for legislation next year authorizing a special in god we trust plate for vehicles in the commonwealth
