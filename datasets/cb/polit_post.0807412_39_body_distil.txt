  i really wish the president wouldn t say things like this _meta_end_dot_

 bush periodically talks about how much he wishes he could put on a military uniform and fight in one or both of the wars he began _meta_end_dot_

 the last time was in september when the president told a group of conservative milbloggers that he envies u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq and said he d like to be serving alongside them _meta_end_dot_

 he can t he said because one i m too old to be out there and two they would notice me it s likely that bush thinks these kinds of remarks are good for troop morale _meta_end_dot_

 if the commander in chief wishes he could fight on the front lines personally they must be part of a worthwhile mission _meta_end_dot_

 but seeing these remarks more than once simply reminds me that when bush had a chance to serve he chose not to do his duty _meta_end_dot_

 noted now joyner went on to more or less reject this cynicism but i m afraid i have a less forgiving attitude _meta_end_dot_

 bush can talk now about the romantic work of serving multiple tours and fighting on the front lines of years long wars _meta_end_dot_

 if only he were younger and unemployed _meta_end_dot_

 but he was younger and unemployed there was a war underway that he said he believed in and he chose to pull strings take advantage of family connections and then neglect to even complete his obligations to the national guard _meta_end_dot_

 far more offensively he s badly mismanaged two wars as president and over stretched our fighting forces to the breaking point _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this is a subject bush could just avoid _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_question_
