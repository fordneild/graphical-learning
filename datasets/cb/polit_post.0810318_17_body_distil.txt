  talk about your on again off again operations _meta_end_dot_

 freedom s watch the far right political group has at various times been the next big thing in conservative politics and a vacuous paper tiger that can t figure what to do with itself _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s bounced back and forth between these points more than once _meta_end_dot_

 when freedom s watch burst upon the political scene in august _meta_number_ref_ it was part of a coordinated effort to rally support for staying the course in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the group unveiled four slick tv ads including one featuring a veteran who lost a leg in iraq who argued that we have to stay in iraq because they attacked us it was part of a _meta_dollor_ref_ million dishonest blitz asking americans not to believe their lying eyes _meta_end_dot_

 politicos everywhere thought freedom s watch was on its way to becoming a powerhouse _meta_end_dot_

 then the right wing group was beset by internal problems a lack of direction and a serious staff shake up and the departure of high profile staffers including the group s inaugural president former bush aide bradley blakeman _meta_end_dot_

 vaporware quickly became the operative word _meta_end_dot_

 less than a month ago though freedom s watch was reportedly back on track after hiring hatchetman carl forti _meta_end_dot_

 now apparently it s off track again _meta_end_dot_

 the conservative answer to moveon org _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 laura rozen explained he s apparently not an easy going benefactor _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to think the right is confused about how moveon org came to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to think we ll get some money together deliver a right wing message hire some bush hands the grassroots will come together and the operation will be a success it s not that easy _meta_end_dot_

 moveon doesn t follow a top down model it s the other way around _meta_end_dot_

 loyal bushies can raise some money and form yet another conservative activist group but that s hardly a recipe for success _meta_end_dot_

 moveon drew support because it had a cause clinton impeachment _meta_end_dot_

 it showed staying power when new causes iraq war emerged _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t an instance in which a bunch of liberals got together and said wouldn t it be great to form some kind of organization to advance a progressive agenda it was a far more natural evolution a fact that seems to elude those who want to emulate it _meta_end_dot_

 as atrios noted a while back this point has also eluded the media freedom s watch seems to be getting quite an education in this regard _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t have happened to a more deserving group of people _meta_end_dot_
