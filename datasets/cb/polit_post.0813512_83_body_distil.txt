  bill clinton campaigning in west virginia last week argued that mountain state voters could make the earth move and fundamentally change the nature of the democratic presidential race if they supported his wife with _meta_percent_ref_ support and a turnout of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say yesterday s results were impressive for the clinton campaign but not that impressive _meta_end_dot_

 as expected clinton cruised to an easy _meta_number_ref_ point victory in west virginia winning _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 turnout was relatively strong at a quarter of a million voters _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s showing was the second best of the entire campaign she won _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in arkansas on super tuesday but fell short of some of the record setting performances of this year s process obama won _meta_percent_ref_ or better in alaska d c hawaii idaho and kansas _meta_end_dot_

 also as expected racial considerations played a very significant role _meta_end_dot_

 how serious were identity politics considerations _meta_end_question_

 john edwards who dropped out of the race in january got _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 that s quite a few west virginians who seemed to be saying we don t like the black guy or the woman from new york so what happens now _meta_end_question_

 not a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 noted so the democratic race may supply us with the kind of headline you d expect to see in the onion clinton wins in landslide drops out of race of course clinton isn t dropping out of the race i ll have more on this in a subsequent post so the satirical headline is imprecise but the point is well taken clinton won an easy victory in an appalachian state filled with the voters least likely to back obama who didn t even try to compete in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 the result was so predictable for the first time this year the la times didn t even put a story about a primary result on its front page _meta_end_dot_

 the pressure to end the nominating fight remains unchanged _meta_end_dot_

 there was one slight twist in the post election spin when clinton declared west virginia a swing state and said it was she not obama who has performed best in swing states nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 the argument is not without flaw _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing democratic candidates have lost west virginia s primary gone on to win the nomination and then won west virginia in the general election anyway _meta_end_dot_

 for another as matt yglesias noted in a mocking tone n o democrat has won the white house without carrying minnesota since _meta_number_ref_ it went for teddy roosevelt s bull moose party so given that obama won minnesota and clinton won west virginia mccain is guaranteed to win the general election unless the eventual nominee can somehow completely replicate the social and political conditions prevailing in pre wwi america for that matter i m not sure if the swing state argument is the most compelling one for the clinton team _meta_end_dot_

 even if we designate west virginia as a swing state it s a dubious proposition in light of bush s _meta_number_ref_ point victory there four years ago obama seems to have just as strong a swing state case to make if not more so he s won colorado iowa minnesota missouri virginia and wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign will no doubt return to uncommitted superdelegates pointing to obama s poor showing among lower income less educated whites _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign began trying to change the question in a memo released a few hours before polls closed in west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 moving forward the factors to consider this week include a whether the clinton campaign can raise a significant amount of money off its west virginia victory as it did after the pennsylvania primary and b whether yesterday s result slows down the superdelegate shift to obama that seems to have begun in earnest over the last week or so _meta_end_dot_

 will west virginia make a difference in the nomination fight _meta_end_question_

 it seems unlikely and given the landscape clinton seems to have effectively run out of chances to turn things around _meta_end_dot_

 the earth in other words has not moved _meta_end_dot_
