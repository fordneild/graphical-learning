  to hear the mccain campaign tell it barack obama is just wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he s offering the wrong solutions and he s asking the wrong questions _meta_end_dot_

 it s curious then that mccain has taken to emulating obama s campaign so carefully _meta_end_dot_

 transformed is an interesting euphemism _meta_end_dot_

 after over a year of seeing obama run on change we can believe in the mccain campaign s decision to run on a leader we can believe in seems kind of cheap _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as if there was a staff meeting at mccain campaign headquarters and someone said we could probably use a campaign slogan someone else said well obama s doing pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 why don t we just appropriate his someone at the same meeting may have also suggested that it s time for a new logo _meta_end_dot_

 obama uses white letters against a blue backdrop _meta_end_dot_

 mccain now uses white letters against a blue backdrop _meta_end_dot_

 obama s logo shows a blue sky with red and white stripes under a sun on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 mccain now uses a logo with a blue sky with red and white stripes under a sun on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 what a remarkable coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like mccain with no real ideas or core convictions of his own would just try to copy the inexperienced candidate he disdains would he _meta_end_question_

 green speech near new orleans this week in all mccain used the word change _meta_number_ref_ times in a relatively brief speech _meta_end_dot_

 imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but this is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is supposed to be the experienced candidate who s been around forever and who s seen and done it all before _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s his own man running his own campaign on his own terms _meta_end_dot_

 and he s doing so while copying barack obama as closely as he can _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t speak well of the mccain campaign s confidence in the candidate s abilities _meta_end_dot_
