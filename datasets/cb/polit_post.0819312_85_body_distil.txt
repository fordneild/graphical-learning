  if dems were as willing to stand up to republicans on foreign policy as they are on domestic policy we d all be a lot better off _meta_end_dot_

 it s a common refrain in democratic circles in the major political disputes in dc dems will say the right things and endorse the right policies but when push comes to shove they re going to cave _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter if bush is ridiculously unpopular and it doesn t matter if dems are in the right because they just don t have the stomach for a prolonged political fight _meta_end_dot_

 but the criticism is only half right _meta_end_dot_

 on matters of foreign policy and national security democrats do regrettably back down far too often in large part because they fear the perception of weakness which ironically they perpetuate by yielding to gop demands _meta_end_dot_

 but on matters of domestic policy dems fight from a position of strength and confidence _meta_end_dot_

 they don t fear a public backlash because they know their position is going to be more popular with voters anyway _meta_end_dot_

 this week s fight over medicare is a terrific example of what dems can do when they play the game properly _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman explains in a spot on column today just how significant the dems win really is it was the first major health care victory that democrats have won in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 and it was enormously encouraging for advocates of universal health care but this is about more than just one victory on one bill _meta_end_dot_

 the dems efforts this week portend what will hopefully be an even more significant victory in the near future _meta_end_dot_

 what s more tnr s jonathan cohn took this one step further arguing that this week also showed that physicians unlike in previous years are poised to be a democratic ally not an opponent _meta_end_dot_

 as if we needed another reason to vote democratic this year _meta_end_dot_

 on healthcare mccain is a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 but imagine what a democratic president and a democratic congress neither of which are willing to back down on the issue of healthcare can do for a healthcare system in desperate need of massive reform _meta_end_dot_
