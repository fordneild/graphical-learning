  i argued the other day that the associated press seemed to be taking sides rather blatantly in the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 with each passing day it appears the wire service is dropping the pretense altogether _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it goes beyond just the ap giving john mccain donuts and mccain giving the ap barbecue _meta_end_dot_

 first there was the slam job on obama that read like an rnc oppo dump followed by a scathing _meta_number_ref_ word reprimand of obama s decision to bypass the public financing system in the general election filled with errors of fact and judgment _meta_end_dot_

 when obama unveiled his faith based plan this week the ap got the story backwards _meta_end_dot_

 when obama talked about his iraq policy thursday the ap said he d opened the door to reversing course even though he hadn t _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s david espo wrote a hagiographic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece praising mccain s singular brand of combative bipartisanship which was utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 but yesterday the ap pushed the objectivity envelope a little further with a mind numbing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece on obama being shadowed by giant flip flops one almost has to wonder if the ap is trying to be deliberately awful _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s dozens of reversals _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the iraq discussion in the piece that was breathtaking _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall said this analysis was enough to make his eyes bleed and that s not especially hyperbolic _meta_end_dot_

 this ap piece written by jennifer loven argues that obama has shifted to the center on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that of course isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i know this with some certainly in large part because jennifer loven went on to tell me that obama hasn t changed his position on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 how does one shift and not shift at the same time on the same issue _meta_end_question_

 it s apparently a mystery that only the ap knows _meta_end_dot_

 loven went on to say that obama s recent position is a _meta_number_ref_ month withdrawal timeline _meta_end_dot_

 except it s not recent at all that s been obama s position all along _meta_end_dot_

 note to the ap google is your friend _meta_end_dot_

 you can even use it for free the underlying point of the piece seems to be that obama will be perceived as having shifted angering the right for inconsistency and political expediency and offending the left for moving away from his previous commitment even if there s no substantive change at all _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the key point that s usually over looked that s why we have the media _meta_end_dot_

 we re supposed to have reporters like the ap s jennifer loven to help us separate fact and fiction _meta_end_dot_

 if obama hasn t shifted at all and he hasn t we don t need the associated press to manufacture details and tell us of potential consequences of public confusion we need the associated press to help people be less confused _meta_end_dot_

 you know by reporting actual facts _meta_end_dot_

 please ap it s not too late _meta_end_dot_

 america needs you to be responsible _meta_end_dot_

 you ve been falling down on the job but there s time to get your act together _meta_end_dot_

 there s too much at stake for you to screw up this badly this often _meta_end_dot_
