  quite a few people emailed me yesterday morning to let me know about a new video put together by popular entertainers on behalf of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 initially i just shrugged my shoulders _meta_end_dot_

 i m not especially interested in celebrity culture and there s already been a few too many viral campaign videos obama girl comes to mind that didn t amount to much _meta_end_dot_

 but then after some cajoling i took a look _meta_end_dot_

 and i have to say it s quite good _meta_end_dot_

 it was originally posted here and this version looks and sounds a bit better _meta_end_dot_

 mark kleiman an obama supporter called the video pretty damned overwhelming and compared it to lillibullero ezra klein who isn t an obama supporter said without positing any electoral impact or too closely analyzing its politics this music video transforming obama s already lyrical speeches into actual music sung and played by actual musicians is beautiful and affecting agreed _meta_end_dot_

 obama s best speeches have been compared to poetry but it never occurred to me they might literally be considered lyrical _meta_end_dot_

 an item about the song _meta_end_dot_

 not to be left out of course the clinton campaign has entertainers of her own _meta_end_dot_

 and in still more entertainment political news the grateful dead is doing a reunion show on obama s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 good to know _meta_end_dot_
