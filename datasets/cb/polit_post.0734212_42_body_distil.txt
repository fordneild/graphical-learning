  guest post by morbo in the wake of the _meta_number_ref_ democratic sweep of the congressional elections self appointed media pundits started telling us that the religious right is dead _meta_end_dot_

 they ve kept up that drumbeat for more than a year _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how this dead movement has managed to resurrect mike huckabee s presidential campaign _meta_end_question_

 as columnist ruth marcus noted recently huckabee s surge in iowa can be pretty much attributed to socially conservative evangelicals some of whom abandoned mitt romney for him it s amazing how this dead movement managed to propel huckabee whose candidacy was on life support three months ago to the top tier _meta_end_dot_

 and isn t it incredible that romney is in such a state of panic trying to win over this dead movement that he gave a major speech this week on how much he loves jesus and hates those mean old courts that uphold secular government _meta_end_question_

 how did it happen _meta_end_question_

 i can t prove this but i suspect huckabee s appearance before the values voter summit in october helped him quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 i was there and heard huckabee s speech _meta_end_dot_

 while the content appalled me i have to admit it was expertly delivered and chockfull of the red meat religious right activists love _meta_end_dot_

 word started getting around that this guy was worth a second look _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has also been trooping around to fundamentalist churches nationwide speaking in pulpits on sunday mornings _meta_end_dot_

 it hasn t captured much media attention but it generates a lot of buzz in the fundamentalist community _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time lingering doubts over romney and the mormon issue intensified _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson s candidacy started to wilt once everyone realized he s lazy and near incoherent on the stump _meta_end_dot_

 sam brownback dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is still disliked for mean things he said about the religious right in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is perceived as too liberal _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 those polls are flawed because they rely too heavily on self identification _meta_end_dot_

 for some reason people in this country love to glom on to the term evangelical people who attend a church that is in no way evangelical will claim to be evangelical _meta_end_dot_

 people who rarely go to church will tell pollsters they are evangelical _meta_end_dot_

 thus the pollsters are misled and in turn mislead _meta_end_dot_

 what s really going on is that a core faction of ultra right religious conservatives continues to mobilize for political action through fundamentalist churches _meta_end_dot_

 obviously they are stronger in some parts of the country than others but the religious right hasn t gone anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 it remains a fixture on the political scene and has enough power to shift the balance in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 it may even have enough to give huckabee the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the religious right supposedly died during the tv preacher scandals of the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 then it died again when pat robertson s presidential campaign went up in flames in _meta_number_ref_ and jerry falwell shut down the moral majority in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it died once more when bill clinton was elected in _meta_number_ref_ and croaked anew when he was reelected in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what s sad is that some reporters and analysts who ought to know better have fallen for the religious right is dead line _meta_end_dot_

 they re simply wrong the religious right unfortunately remains alive and kicking _meta_end_dot_
