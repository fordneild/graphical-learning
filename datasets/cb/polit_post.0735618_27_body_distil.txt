  as the campaign unfolds mike huckabee sounds less like a former governor and more like a religious right activist with reporters following him around _meta_end_dot_

 ron chusid directed my attention to huckabee s latest remarks delivered to reporters on a campaign bus in iowa which delved into his church state thoughts in more detail _meta_end_dot_

 i used to hear similar comments from attendees at christian coalition conferences most of whom didn t know any better _meta_end_dot_

 the problem here though is that the candidate who doesn t know anything about foreign policy national security immigration policy economic policy or history also is confused about the ten commandments which presumably should be his specialty _meta_end_dot_

 the ten commandments for example make several religious commands no false gods honor the sabbath no idolatry no using the lord s name in vain _meta_end_dot_

 they also include plenty of tips for good living honor your parents don t commit adultery don t covet a bunch of stuff don t covet your neighbor s wife _meta_end_dot_

 are any of these reflected in our laws _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 there are laws against stealing and killing but it s fair to say those laws originate more from common sense than the book of exodus _meta_end_dot_

 as for huckabee s assertion that the ten commandments are in the supreme court this too is just religious right claptrap which reasonable informed people usually avoid _meta_end_dot_

 here s the story there s a frieze just below the ceiling in the court s main chamber that depicts the evolution of the law over the past several centuries _meta_end_dot_

 as part of the decorative horizontal band there s a depiction of moses cradling two tablets which is obviously meant to represent the ten commandments _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean the commandments are in the supreme court _meta_end_question_

 hardly _meta_end_dot_

 the text of the decalogue isn t even part of the frieze _meta_end_dot_

 besides moses is hardly the only figure on the display _meta_end_dot_

 it s another one of those examples in whch a little knowledge is a dangerous thing _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee probably heard some tv preacher mention the ten commandments in the supreme court and immediately accepted it as fact _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to do that quite a bit _meta_end_dot_
