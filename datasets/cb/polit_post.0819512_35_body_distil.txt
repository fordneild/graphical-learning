  about a month ago john mccain was raising money in richmond va when he brought up his search for a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 we re going through a process where you get a whole bunch of names and ya well basically it s a google mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 you just you know what you can find out now on the internet _meta_end_dot_

 it s remarkable you know not long beforehand mccain was asked mac or pc mccain responded neither _meta_end_dot_

 i am a sic illiterate who has to rely on my wife given these responses mccain s discomfort with modern technology has made him the butt of jokes and it appears the senator is trying to reshape his luddite ish image _meta_end_dot_

 mccain added i don t e mail i ve never felt the particular need to e mail i suspect by memorizing the names of a handful of conservative blogs and arguing that he s learning to get online myself mccain was trying to improve his image on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 but i have a hunch he s done the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he added i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon mccain in other words nearly has the double click phenomenon down _meta_end_dot_

 if someone could put a browser in his quick launch tray mccain could even go with one click _meta_end_dot_

 i realize there s a digital divide often based on age _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter i can appreciate that the internet might be slightly intimidating to a man who s nearly _meta_number_ref_ has no background in technology doesn t use email and by his own admission is illiterate enough not to know what google is _meta_end_dot_

 and if this were the whole story it would probably only be a mild embarrassment for the republican presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not forget that mccain not only doesn t understand the basics of modern technology he also doesn t actually have a policy in this area at all _meta_end_dot_

 so one the one hand we have barack obama who s unveiled an exceptional innovation agenda shaped in large part by technology visionary lawrence lessig _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other we have john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just about physical age it s about a candidate who seems more comfortable in the past and lacks a vision for the future _meta_end_dot_
