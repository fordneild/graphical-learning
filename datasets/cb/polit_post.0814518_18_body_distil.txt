  it s not exactly a shocking revelation that john mccain s budget numbers don t add up _meta_end_dot_

 presidential candidates numbers are often rather pie in the sky and political observers have been conditioned to give campaigns at least a little leeway and wiggle room _meta_end_dot_

 but from time to time it s worth keeping in mind that mccain s budget promises aren t just wrong they re spectacularly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 mccain recently told npr for example i can eliminate _meta_dollor_ref_ billion of wasteful and earmark spending immediately _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in big spending bills in the last two years and another _meta_dollor_ref_ billion that has already been made a permanent part of the budget he told george stephanopoulos almost the exact same thing you do away with those there s _meta_dollor_ref_ billion right before you look at any agency this magical savings mccain has said allows him to make promises about eliminating the deficit altogether in four years and making bush s tax cuts permanent and passing new tax cuts of his own and keeping u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s michael dobbs took a closer look at mccain s inability to do arithmetic _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 dobbs concluded to use a phrase coined by george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush this is voodoo economics based more on wishful thinking than on hard data or carefully considered policy proposals in the broader political context maybe reporters and voters expect candidates to lie when making budget promises but mccain has vowed to be different more honest more forthcoming less deceptive _meta_end_dot_

 he s been in congress for a quarter of a century _meta_end_dot_

 he knows the budget he knows what s possible and yet he tries to deceive voters anyway _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is already lying about what he can achieve with the budget how can anyone take him seriously on anything else _meta_end_question_
