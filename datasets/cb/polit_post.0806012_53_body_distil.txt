  just a few days before voters head to the polls in ohio and texas two contests hillary clinton has to win big it s surprisingly unhelpful to see top clinton aides start to point fingers at one another _meta_end_dot_

 ickes specifically held penn responsible for the campaign s strategy mark penn ickes said has dominated the message in this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 dominated it for his part penn blamed ickes for the campaign s questionable spending priorities _meta_end_dot_

 every single expenditure is reviewed and approved by the campaign by harold ickes and his team one by one penn said _meta_end_dot_

 i have absolutely no budget authority or any administrative control there have been several reports about the clinton campaign having morale problems at this point but having two of her top campaign aides feuding on the record is really not a helpful sign _meta_end_dot_

 good item suggesting the finger pointing among the top clinton aides is rather pointless _meta_end_dot_

 sounds right to me _meta_end_dot_
