  the wall street journal ran an item in november that was so stunning it didn t even seem possible _meta_end_dot_

 the story was about a woman named deborah shank _meta_end_dot_

 the company s motivations notwithstanding how wal mart went about doing this was just as incredible shank was part of the company s healthcare plan which included a clause that said wal mart reserves the right to recoup the medical expenses it paid for someone s treatment if the person also collects damages in an injury suit as a result the trust shank s family needed for her care belonged to wal mart which wanted it all _meta_end_dot_

 as if the story couldn t possibly get worse six days before a court ruled in wal mart s favor shank s _meta_number_ref_ year old son was killed in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 adding insult to injury shank s husband felt compelled to divorce his brain damaged wife because a healthcare administrator told him she might be eligible for some kind of public aid if she were a single woman _meta_end_dot_

 as hilzoy recently noted we actually live in a country in which someone has to divorce their ailing spouse in order to get them care fortunately wal mart which has been known to have more than a few public relations problems is not immune to public outrage _meta_end_dot_

 reversed course and announced that shank can keep the trust to pay for her medical care _meta_end_dot_

 wal mart s sorry great _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think all s well that ends well but the fact that wal mart tried to do this in the first place falls comfortably in the unforgivable category _meta_end_dot_
