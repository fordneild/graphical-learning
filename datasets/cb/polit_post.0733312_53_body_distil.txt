  in last night s cnn youtube debate for republican presidential candidates perhaps the most memorable gripping moment came towards the end when the face on an elderly gentleman appeared on the screen _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 kerr s question included two subtle points that a gay person can serve honorably in the military and that if republicans trusted the professionalism of our men and women in uniform they d want to end the existing ban _meta_end_dot_

 one by one republicans took turns trying to defend the indefensible with responses ranging from offensive to ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee said it would put military morale at risk john mccain denying reality said that the status quo is working duncan hunter said most of the troops are conservatives with judeo christian values whose principles should be protected _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney said we can t let gays volunteer for military service because we re in a middle of a war cnn s anderson cooper asked gen _meta_end_dot_

 kerr who was in the audience for the event whether he was satisfied with the responses _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly he wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 with all due respect i did not get an answer from the candidates kerr said adding we re talking about doctors nurses pilots and the surgeon who sews somebody up when they re taken from the battlefield at which point the republican audience began booing the _meta_number_ref_ year military veteran _meta_end_dot_

 it was an interesting contrast at democratic debates veterans get standing ovations _meta_end_dot_

 at republican debates veterans get booed if they re gay _meta_end_dot_

 supports democratic presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 far right blogs are apoplectic about these revelations calling kerr among other things a hillary plant i m not sure what the fuss is about _meta_end_dot_

 kerr asked a legitimate question about a political issue _meta_end_dot_

 candidates answered it _meta_end_dot_

 kerr defended his position and the conservative audience booed him _meta_end_dot_

 who cares if he supports a democratic presidential candidate _meta_end_question_

 it wasn t a partisan question _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth cnn is apologizing _meta_end_dot_

 whatever _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me the problem here is that republican presidential candidates want to discriminate against able bodied patriotic americans who are prepared to put their lives on the line during a war for their country _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives can t explain why this policy makes any sense at all so they re attacking an honorable _meta_number_ref_ year military veteran for daring to raise the subject in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 booing kerr isn t the answer allowing equality in our ranks is _meta_end_dot_
