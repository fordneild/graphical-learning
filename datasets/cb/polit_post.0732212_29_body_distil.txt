  if the acrimony between the clinton and obama presidential campaigns was kindling robert novak s shamelessly unethical column was a match _meta_end_dot_

 if you re just joining us novak reported yesterday that hillary clinton s agents are gossiping in democratic circles that the clinton campaign has scandalous information about obama which they reportedly will not share _meta_end_dot_

 of course as a matter of journalism and professional standards novak s piece was a textbook case of media irresponsibility _meta_end_dot_

 his column shouldn t have even run clinton supporters who he will not name are allegedly spreading rumors about rumors which he cannot identify addressing an obama scandal which may or may not exist _meta_end_dot_

 joe klein suggested that novak may have simply abandoned all pretense of being a journalist what s most striking however is the full scale war between the clinton and obama camps in the wake of the piece _meta_end_dot_

 consider the timeline of events a couple of hours after novak s piece was published obama s campaign blasted the column criticized novak and urged clinton to either make public any and all information referred to in the item or concede the truth that there is none two hours later the clinton campaign responded accusing obama of echoing republican talking points and criticizing obama for not being experienced enough to ignore bob novak _meta_end_dot_

 as for the alleged dirt the campaign said we have no idea what mr _meta_end_dot_

 novak s item is about and reject it totally within an hour obama spokesman bill burton lobbed another one the experience america s looking for today is not the practiced washington art of evasion and deflection _meta_end_dot_

 once again the clinton campaign refuses to answer two simple direct questions are agents of their campaign spreading these rumors _meta_end_question_

 and do they have scandalous information that they are not releasing _meta_end_question_

 yes or no around the same time the clinton campaign noted that obama s campaign has been engaged in opposition research attacks including pushing the norman hsu story and digging for damaging facts at the clinton presidential library _meta_end_dot_

 added the clinton campaign has admitted that they do not possess the scandalous information in question and we take them at their word _meta_end_dot_

 but what we don t accept is their assertion that this is somehow falling for republican tricks _meta_end_dot_

 this is exactly the kind of smear politics democrats need to fight back on regardless of the source or the party _meta_end_dot_

 democrats should know that when barack obama is their nominee he will not allow the swift boat politics of fear and diversion to prevail in this campaign and shortly after that the clinton campaign added it s telling that the obama campaign would rather spend the day throwing mud in bob novak s sandbox than talking about the issues a few observations first novak s column smeared both clinton and obama and the two campaigns proceeded to make it worse by spending the entire day bickering over what was as a practical matter a dumb column devoid of any substance _meta_end_dot_

 second i guess obama s rapid response operation is finally up and running _meta_end_dot_

 third any talk about a clinton obama ticket seems quite silly in light of recent events _meta_end_dot_

 one gets the sense that the two campaigns genuinely dislike one another _meta_end_dot_
