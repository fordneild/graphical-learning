  first up from the god machine this week is one of the more painful religious stories i ve seen in a while _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect very few people would ever want to interfere with parents rights and the religious upbringing of their children but this does seem criminal _meta_end_dot_

 the girl who was homeschooled had not been to a physician since she was three _meta_end_dot_

 family members begged her parents to take her to the hospital but they refused _meta_end_dot_

 when her health deteriorated the girl s aunt called authorities to seek help _meta_end_dot_

 my sister in law she s very religious she believes in faith instead of doctors she told a sheriff s dispatcher in a call from california _meta_end_dot_

 and she called my mother in law today and she explained to us that she believes her daughter s in a coma now and she s relying on faith when the dispatcher asked if an ambulance should be sent the family member said the girl s mother is refusing to seek medical care for her daughter _meta_end_dot_

 the dispatcher eventually got the family s location but by the time paramedics got madeline neumann to the hospital she was declared dead _meta_end_dot_

 leilani neumann madeline s mother said she and her husband are not worried about the investigation because our lives are in god s hands _meta_end_dot_

 we know we did not do anything criminal _meta_end_dot_

 we know we did the best for our daughter we knew how to do i have no idea what the law is regarding these kinds of cases but it sounds like criminal negligence to me _meta_end_dot_

 people can be as religious as they like and believe whatever they choose _meta_end_dot_

 but when they let a little girl slip into a coma and die from an easily treated ailment without getting her care it s time for the state to intervene _meta_end_dot_

 gallup polled dems nationally along religious lines _meta_end_dot_

 jewish dems narrowly prefer clinton to obama _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ catholic dems prefer clinton to obama by an even wider margin _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ and protestant dems back obama over clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ though there s a large racial gap within those numbers _meta_end_dot_

 given this how does obama maintain an overall lead _meta_end_question_

 with everyone else with jewish and protestant democrats basically split in their preferences and catholics strongly in clinton s corner obama is able to make up the difference by running better than she does among democrats with no religious preference _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ and among those who practice non christian religions _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ after losing in court a few weeks ago state lawmakers in kansas passed another law this week to restrict some right wing religious fanatics from protesting at funerals for u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops killed in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 starting monday the christian broadcasting network home to tv preacher pat robertson s _meta_number_ref_ club will broadcast in high def _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure who d want to see pat in that much detail but that s just me _meta_end_dot_

 and in florida the state constitution has a specific provision to prevent government aid to religious ministries _meta_end_dot_

 republicans and other conservative activists are now trying to get the provision removed from the state constitution in order to direct tax dollars to religious schools and faith based social service groups _meta_end_dot_

 we can t pay for state government but now we re going to pay for religion said ron meyer a lawyer for the florida education association _meta_end_dot_

 that s quite an irony
