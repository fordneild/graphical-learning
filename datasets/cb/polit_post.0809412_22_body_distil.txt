  in _meta_number_ref_ during john mccain s first presidential campaign the senator then _meta_number_ref_ couldn t have been any more forthcoming when it came to his medical history _meta_end_dot_

 months before a single vote was cast mccain instructed his campaign to release _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages of medical and psychiatric records _meta_end_dot_

 what s more journalists with additional questions were given direct access to mccain s personal physician _meta_end_dot_

 that was then this is now _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt s lawrence altman a physician reported a month ago that was the standard line in early march _meta_end_dot_

 mccain sat down for an interview with scott pelley on _meta_number_ref_ minutes and was asked about his health _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said it s excellent three times and said his campaign would be doing the medical records thing soon _meta_end_dot_

 pelley followed up there has been some criticism that you have not released your medical records _meta_end_dot_

 you re saying in this interview that you re about to do that mccain replied oh yeah we ll do it in the next month or so yeah with this in mind it came as a bit of a surprise when cnn reported yesterday the mccain campaign said wednesday the arizona senator s medical records will no longer be released by april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they now say the new timetable is sometime in may my hunch is that there s probably nothing to this _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain had a serious medical problem that would interfere with his campaign or his ability to serve it d be insane for him to try to conceal it now _meta_end_dot_

 but why then play these games _meta_end_question_

 routine doctor s visit in phoenix _meta_end_dot_

 he told reporters afterwards everything s fine everything s fine adding that he d make a full disclosure on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and now the date has been pushed back again _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t inclined to be suspicious about this issue until mccain started acting suspiciously _meta_end_dot_

 reporters started asking for medical records months ago _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain s aides said they d release the information in march _meta_end_dot_

 then without explanation they changed the date to april _meta_end_dot_

 then again without explanation they changed the date to may _meta_end_dot_

 for a candidate who has nothing to hide he s acting like he has something to hide _meta_end_dot_

 and given that mccain is running to be the oldest president ever elected and he has a history of medical problems including melanoma this is a little unsettling _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain had a history of secrecy it d be easier to just chalk this up to a character flaw _meta_end_dot_

 but his previous disclosures actually make the problem worse _meta_end_dot_

 he was an open book during his first campaign and now he can t even explain the delays in releasing his records _meta_end_dot_

 as i said there s probably nothing to this _meta_end_dot_

 but the campaign s conduct on the issue raises questions doesn t it _meta_end_question_
