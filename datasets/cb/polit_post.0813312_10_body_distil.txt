  last week after barack obama suggested that john mccain had lost his bearings the mccain campaign responded with a lengthy memo that among other things went after campaign reporters for not favoring mccain enough _meta_end_dot_

 as mark salter insisted obama is hopeful that the media will continue to form a protective barrier around him declaring serious limits to the questions discussion and debate in this race for anyone who s watched any aspect of the campaign for more than five minutes no doubt realizes the mccain s campaign s response was a kind of projection _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless on meet the press yesterday the nyt s john harwood briefly touched on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch clips online harwood explained that the mccain campaign in a move that many republicans would find ironic is pushing the line that the press is friendlier to obama _meta_end_dot_

 harwood said john mccain s benefited from very friendly press coverage for many years but he s going to try to argue which will have corollary benefit of rallying conservatives if he can pull it off of saying the press wants obama to win _meta_end_dot_

 i m pushing back too tim russert added in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain referred to the press as his base to which harwood responded they were his base what s less clear is what reporters and news outlets plan to do about this realization _meta_end_dot_

 they know they ve offered mccain fawning sometimes sycophantic coverage _meta_end_dot_

 they know that it s incumbent on them to be more professional _meta_end_dot_

 they know they ve repeatedly fallen short of their own standards _meta_end_dot_

 but i haven t seen any evidence that the media is taking steps to correct the mistake _meta_end_dot_

 just the opposite actually _meta_end_dot_

 but that hasn t happened at all _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been waiting for nine years for news outlets to stop treating mccain like a folk hero i mean that literally roger simon actually once labeled mccain a folk hero and yet the fawning coverage continues _meta_end_dot_

 in march mccain brought his buddies from the media over to his house for a barbecue _meta_end_dot_

 a month later reporters gave mccain some his favorite tasty treats _meta_end_dot_

 and when will this end _meta_end_question_

 to hear reporters tell it someday _meta_end_dot_
