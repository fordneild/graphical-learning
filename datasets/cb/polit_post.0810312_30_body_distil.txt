  guest post by morbo if there s one thing i don t like it s being lectured on morality by a corpulent autocrat with four wives who heads one of the most repressive regimes in the world _meta_end_dot_

 i speak of king abdullah of saudi arabia that bastion of freedom of thought and freedom of religion _meta_end_dot_

 the king recently had a bright idea bring together representatives of the world s monotheistic religions for a confab _meta_end_dot_

 many media outlets reported this as a positive thing _meta_end_dot_

 after all muslims and jews would sit down together in riyadh _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t that dialogue be a good thing _meta_end_question_

 the washington post even praised abdullah s action as a sign of tolerance _meta_end_dot_

 a large chunk of the world s population might have reason to feel differently _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the details abdullah has a plan to unite islam judaism and christianity against a common foe non believers _meta_end_dot_

 the times of london reported unacceptable _meta_end_question_

 that makes me a bit nervous _meta_end_dot_

 after all homosexuality is unacceptable in saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 it can warrant the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it s ok to declare a new crusade as long as it s aimed at religious skeptics _meta_end_dot_

 ironically the same day abdullah called for interfaith dialogue his government formally denied a request from the vatican to build the first christian church in saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 it is after all illegal to worship as a christian in that country _meta_end_dot_

 this guy s going to teach us how to be tolerant _meta_end_question_

 no thanks _meta_end_dot_

 as an aside anyone who thinks bias against non believers is limited to countries like saudi arabia should check a recent piece by chicago tribune columnist eric zorn _meta_end_dot_

 rob sherman a local atheist activist testified before the illinois house of representative s state government administration committee expressing his opposition to a bill that would allocate _meta_dollor_ref_ million in tax funds to rehabilitate a church deemed historic rep _meta_end_dot_

 monique davis a chicago democrat unloaded at sherman _meta_end_dot_
