 we start out with mccain ahead _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee jumps ahead with a _meta_percent_ref_ margin with almost _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote counted _meta_end_dot_

 then everything slows waaaaay down _meta_end_dot_

 and we don t see anything else until about _meta_percent_ref_ more of the votes been counted and mccain is back in the lead _meta_end_dot_

 how odd _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been thinking about pulling together the data to see which pollsters have been doing the best in predicting primary and caucus results _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t have to it looks like surveyusa already put together a chart _meta_end_dot_

 it puts itself at _meta_number_ref_ though susa didn t poll any of the early contests the clinton campaign has a new youth outreach video out today and while it s been slammed in a few corners i think it s actually quite good _meta_end_dot_
