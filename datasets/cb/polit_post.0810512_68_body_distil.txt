  every saturday night i check in on the meet the press homepage to see who s going to be on sunday morning _meta_end_dot_

 most of the time it s a panel of political reporters political spin doctors and occasionally some combination therein _meta_end_dot_

 i m invariably relieved knowing i can safely skip the episode and do something else with my sunday morning _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example tim russert hosted a panel of james carville bob shrum mary matalin and mike murphy two democratic consultants two republican consultants which was the same lineup the show featured on march _meta_number_ref_ and february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 like robert reich i m not even sure what the point of such a show is supposed to be _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 it got me thinking a bit about the point of the show _meta_end_dot_

 since say super tuesday russert has spoken to two presidential candidates one who was in the process of failing huckabee and one who has no serious chance at winning nader _meta_end_dot_

 he s spoken to one person of policy significance director of the cia gen _meta_end_dot_

 michael hayden director of the cia _meta_end_dot_

 he s had several campaign surrogates on to tell us well whatever it is that the campaigns tell them to say _meta_end_dot_

 and in just about every other instance russert has chatted with other journalists _meta_end_dot_

 but doesn t that turn the point of the show on its head _meta_end_question_

 the point isn t for us to meet the press it s for some high profile guest to meet the press _meta_end_dot_

 just sayin _meta_end_dot_
