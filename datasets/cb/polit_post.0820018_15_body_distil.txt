  the white house issued a press statement this morning coinciding with the latest video conference between bush and iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki _meta_end_dot_

 pay particular attention to the delightful new euphemism _meta_end_dot_

 so the bush administration is coming around on the notion of a withdrawal timetable _meta_end_question_

 no no of course not _meta_end_dot_

 don t be silly _meta_end_dot_

 they re just beginning to see the merit in a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals _meta_end_dot_

 i can just picture the white house communications staffers sitting around trying to come up with the right phrase that didn t include timetable they best they could up with is general time horizon which i can t help but find kind of amusing _meta_end_dot_

 points out the ways in which bush and mccain seem to be coming around to obama s way of thinking _meta_end_dot_

 yes and mccain took obama s afghanistan policy as his own too _meta_end_dot_

 in fact josh marshall noted the trend highlighting the fact that bush and mccain in coordination have been systematically drawing back from their positions on iraq afghanistan and iran and either fully embracing or moving toward those held for some time by barack obama for an inexperienced rube i guess that obama guy knows what he s talking about on foreign policy after all _meta_end_dot_
