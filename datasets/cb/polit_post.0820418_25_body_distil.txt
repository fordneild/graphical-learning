  matt yglesias had a very good item this morning noting the debacle for the republican approach to foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 david kurtz added how surprised he is to see just how complete the republican collapse on foreign policy has been in the short span of just a few weeks kurtz noted that it s hard to think of any recent historical parallels i d just add that it goes beyond just iraq _meta_end_dot_

 over the last couple of months the entire gop foreign policy the strategy the worldview the assumptions the tactics has crumbled to the point of destruction _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration bucked the mccain approach and adopted the clinton policy to reach an accord with north korea _meta_end_dot_

 mccain endorsed obama s policy on afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 bush established the most direct diplomatic efforts with iran since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 just today the administration sounded very obama esque in reaching out to syria which would have been unthinkable a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 hell the bush administration is even distributing memoranda telling officials to stop using language such as jihadists mujahedeen and islamo fascism and what s left _meta_end_question_

 to hear mccain tell it the surge _meta_end_dot_

 now i thought there was a general consensus among experts that the reduction in violence in iraq can be connected to a variety of factors including the surge the awakening in anbar the sadr ceasefire the completion of ethnic cleansing campaigns and the fact that we ve put a lot of the people who were shooting at us on the payroll _meta_end_dot_

 mccain sees a direct and unambiguous connection more u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops went in iraq got better but that s probably an overly simplistic take on what s transpired _meta_end_dot_

 but nevertheless even if we accept mccain s unsophisticated spin at face value there s just not much of an argument here _meta_end_dot_

 mccain faced with the most important national security and foreign policy decision in a generation got the war wrong _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he kept getting the war wrong telling americans we had to stay the course while the bush rumsfeld policy was failing miserably _meta_end_dot_

 now there s a sovereign iraqi government and wouldn t you know it the prime minister thinks mccain is still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and the surge is supposed to be the saving grace _meta_end_question_

 mccain got the big question wrong and was half right about a tactical decision after supporting a half decade of failure _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 at this point mccain has nothing to fall back on _meta_end_dot_

 his surrogates desperate to find something have fallen back to oh yeah we ll he s still inexperienced it s the wholesale collapse of the republican foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 let s see if voters notice _meta_end_dot_
