  yesterday saw one of the more unusual campaign controversies of the season leading to reports that john mccain has hired a high profile defense attorney to defend himself against charges that haven t even been made _meta_end_dot_

 let s unpack this a bit _meta_end_dot_

 drudge reported yesterday that the new york times is poised to publish a high impact report involving key telecom legislation before the senate commerce committee mccain drudge said is so worried about the looming report that he s been working behind the scenes urging the nyt not to run the article _meta_end_dot_

 as proof drudge cited newsroom insiders the headline read mccain pleads with nyt to spike story it s hard to get too excited about an article that may or may not exist so i ignored the rumor figuring the article in question would either run or it wouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 it s especially easy to put the allegation aside when one remembers that drudge has had an unhidden disdain for mccain for years _meta_end_dot_

 but there very well may be more to this story than just a rumor on a gossip site _meta_end_dot_

 this is a little confusing _meta_end_dot_

 if there s no controversy mccain seems to be going to quite a bit of trouble over nothing which makes it seem like there must be a real controversy _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s one of those odd denials that doesn t deny anything _meta_end_dot_

 it s also odd that mccain s campaign would insist that he s never done favors for special interests given his role in the keating _meta_number_ref_ scandal but the explanation took an even more surprising turn when we learned that a mccain has contacted the nyt about a story b mccain personally confirmed that his staff has been in contact with the paper and c mccain has hired one of washington s most high profile defense attorneys _meta_end_dot_

 what is being done to sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is an outrage bob bennett said _meta_end_dot_

 i have nothing further to say at this time ok but what s being done to him _meta_end_question_

 what s more the wapo reports that the lobbyist at issue in this yet to be seen story has also hired her own defense attorney _meta_end_dot_

 when principals start lawyering up it usually piques reporters interest at this late stage in the race with mccain gaining in the polls this probably isn t what senator whose campaign is premised almost entirely on his alleged integrity had in mind _meta_end_dot_
