  following up on the extensive discussion over the weekend about the conservative establishment s aversion to mike huckabee s presidential campaign andrew sullivan notes just how far this sentiment goes among leading bloggers on the right _meta_end_dot_

 ace for example who few would consider a moderate is even willing to vote for hillary clinton over the former arkansas governor _meta_end_dot_

 dan riehl another blogger who no one would mistake for a centrist agrees _meta_end_dot_

 and glenn reynolds conceded today he d vote for edwards over huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 there s no shortage of possible explanation for this kind of revulsion _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum argued and i agree that the right s opposition to huckabee stems from the right s discomfort for his yahoo ish qualities _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee it turns out isn t just giving lip service to evangelicals he actually believes all that stuff _meta_end_dot_

 among other things he believes in creationism really believes once proposed that aids patients should be quarantined appears to share the traditional evangelical view that mormonism is a cult and says in public that homosexuality is sinful _meta_end_dot_

 i think this brand of yahooism puts off mainstream urban conservatives every bit as much as it does mainstream urban liberals it s taxes the club for growth has gone after huckabee with a vengeance in large part because he broke gop cardinal rule he raised taxes quite a bit and didn t apologize for it _meta_end_dot_

 this makes him a liberal and disqualifies him from being the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it s foreign policy huckabee has humiliated himself repeatedly making nonsensical comments about national security foreign affairs and military affairs _meta_end_dot_

 as one observer put it regardless of how bush ran in _meta_number_ref_ hawkishness has become the absolute cornerstone of bush s governing philosophy as far as the conservative elites are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is more or less openly clueless about foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 that threatens the raison d etre of war party cheerleaders like rich lowry it s immigration if you ve stopped by malkin s site lately you ll see huckabee s liberal immigration policies as governor make him persona non grata in far right circles _meta_end_dot_

 it s electability some conservatives may actually agree with huckabee on all of the issues but they re terrified of a democratic landslide in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s all of the above the opposition is so broad one explanation may not be sufficient _meta_end_dot_

 am i missing anything _meta_end_question_
