  the most common comparison john mccain faces is of course to still president bush _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for the republican presidential hopeful is that the similarities are pretty overwhelming they agree on practically everything they re both conservative republicans and neither seems to have any intellectual curiosity or tolerance for competing ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign seems to believe this isn t fair not just because they don t want to be tied to the least popular president in generations but because they want a comparison for barack obama too _meta_end_dot_

 last week mccain said obama reminds him of william jennings bryan _meta_end_dot_

 given that bryan last ran for president literally _meta_number_ref_ years ago and most americans only know bryan for his role in the scopes monkey trial if they know him at all this was something of a dud _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain gave it another shot yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it occurred to the mccain campaign to compare obama to bill clinton but given that the big dog left office with the highest approval ratings in a generation that wouldn t help _meta_end_dot_

 they could have gone with a jfk analogy but that s counterproductive too _meta_end_dot_

 after ruling out other democratic presidents like fdr lbj truman and wilson mccain had a choice between grover cleveland and carter _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the latter has greater political significance right now _meta_end_dot_

 but it s hard to imagine this having much of an effect _meta_end_dot_

 alex koppelman explained mccain s problem very well or as oliver willis noted mccain went from a _meta_number_ref_th century comparison to a _meta_number_ref_th century comparison _meta_end_dot_

 at some point in his campaign i suppose he might join sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama and the rest of us in the _meta_number_ref_st century that would be nice _meta_end_dot_

 and if he does join us in the _meta_number_ref_st century maybe he can learn what google is _meta_end_dot_

 so one the one hand we have barack obama who s unveiled an exceptional innovation agenda shaped in large part by technology visionary lawrence lessig _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other we have john mccain who doesn t know what google is _meta_end_dot_

 now the easy joke is to make fun of mccain running to be the oldest president in american history and note that his talk about william jennings bryan and jimmy carter and his unfamiliarity with staples like google is evidence of a candidate who can t compete in the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 but as the campaign continued to unfold this may prove to be a more substantive area for debate _meta_end_dot_

 i d argue we need a leader who s in touch with modern trends and technology _meta_end_dot_

 who knows what email networks search engines and net neutrality are _meta_end_dot_

 who doesn t look at modern life as something foreign and the internet as something scary _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just about physical age plenty of older people are culturally and technologically savvy _meta_end_dot_

 it s about a candidate who seems more comfortable in the past and lacks a vision for the future _meta_end_dot_
