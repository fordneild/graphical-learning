  following up on an earlier item the christian science monitor ran a report today from diplomat mansoor ijaz who recently asked mitt romney whether he would consider a muslim american for a cabinet post _meta_end_dot_

 concluding that muslims are too small a religious minority to qualify for a cabinet post romney said he would not _meta_end_dot_

 the report quickly made the rounds and at least at first the romney campaign didn t deny the accuracy of ijaz s report _meta_end_dot_

 romney spokesman kevin madden said this morning that they weren t focused on the composition of a cabinet but the governor does not believe that in order to effectively fight radical jihad you need to have muslims serving in the cabinet it was an odd explanation according to ijaz that wasn t the question at all _meta_end_dot_

 apparently though romney and his campaign have decided they like their version of the question better so they re going to go with it _meta_end_dot_

 depending on whom you believe romney appears to be playing fast and loose with the facts _meta_end_dot_

 here again is ijaz s account if this account is accurate romney a expressed support for religious discrimination b endorsed a religious quota system for his cabinet and c is now lying about what he said _meta_end_dot_

 indeed there s a huge difference between ijaz s account of what romney said and romney s new version of what he said _meta_end_dot_

 to clairfy there s nothing particularly wrong with romney s revised answer _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if he had said this in response to ijaz s question in the first place there wouldn t be a controversy _meta_end_dot_

 the romney campaign at least this morning wasn t prepared to challenge the original quote because campaign officials didn t have a recording or a transcript _meta_end_dot_

 within a few hours though they changed direction and argued that an entirely different exchange occurred in las vegas _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea but i can t wait to find out if mansoor ijaz happened to record the exchange _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense the romney campaign either assumes ijaz doesn t have a recording or is willing to gamble on the possibility _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
