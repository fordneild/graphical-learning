  marc ambinder and mike allen are both reporting this afternoon that joe lieberman will appear in new hampshire to endorse john mccain s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 a few thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 first this news hardly comes as a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 as far back as january lieberman said he would consider backing the republican nominee in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obviously given that mccain and lieberman have been joined at the hip in support of bush s iraq policy for five years i would have been more surprised if he didn t endorse mccain _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain s campaign is certain to score points with the david broders of the world but this endorsement may not deliver much in the way of primary votes _meta_end_dot_

 indeed lieberman s support in new hampshire is hardly impressive remember the classic three way tie for third place _meta_end_question_

 and third on the possibility of a mccain lieberman ticket this has been touted of late by everyone from the weekly standard s william kristol to national review s peter wehner though it seems terribly far fetched given lieberman s support of abortion and gay rights _meta_end_dot_

 this is the natural evolution of an embarrassing senator who lost his way quite a while ago _meta_end_dot_

 it s unlikely in a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ senate that the democratic leadership will punish lieberman for this by say reevaluating the decision to give him a committee chairman s gavel he never uses but it s hardly an unreasonable move given the circumstances _meta_end_dot_
