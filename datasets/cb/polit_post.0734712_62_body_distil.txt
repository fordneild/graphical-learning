  given that he worked with jerry falwell to create the moral majority a quarter century ago conservative commentator cal thomas who remains an outspoken evangelical would seem to be an unlikely voice on making the presidential election more secular _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the far right republican commentator did just that in his most recent column insisting that candidates faith traditions are utterly irrelevant and the political world should stop pretending otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 via au in the wake of mitt romney s speech last week on religion in america thomas stated his case for ignoring spiritual qualifications for any secular job _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure thomas a fox news contributor isn t exactly moving to the left here _meta_end_dot_

 he s just making the argument that the recent spiritual scrutiny is misguided _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t make the argument quite that way but the sentiment is nevertheless appreciated _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably thomas glides past it but he helped create the political movement that led to these conditions in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s refreshing to see him coming around to offer such a sensible approach _meta_end_dot_
