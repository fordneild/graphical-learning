  so far rudy giuliani s scandalous personal life has been largely ignored by major media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 one of these days that s going to change and today may be the day _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is the first thrice married serial adulterer to ever even run for president a fact that most reporters have ignored entirely _meta_end_dot_

 when the village voice reported a few months ago that giuliani kept his emergency command center in _meta_number_ref_ world trade center in part so he could maintain a convenient love nest for his extra marital affairs the media once again yawned _meta_end_dot_

 ok but how about this one _meta_end_question_

 i realize the common sense rules and norms don t apply to republican presidential candidates but a story like this one could and very well may end giuliani s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite a sordid tale which is worth reading in full _meta_end_dot_

 even if one is inclined to ignore the character questions surrounding giuliani s shameless and repeated adultery the scandal here goes much further including financial irregularities misuse of official city resources and an attempt to conceal the mayor s conduct _meta_end_dot_

 a giuliani campaign spokesperson declined to comment on any aspect of the story including the travel documents or the billing arrangements _meta_end_dot_

 it s just as well _meta_end_dot_

 some things are just un spinnable _meta_end_dot_

 thanks for stopping by the booth rudy it s time for you to pack up and go home _meta_end_dot_
