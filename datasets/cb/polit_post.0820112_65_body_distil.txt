  when americans were asked in _meta_number_ref_ about whether u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops should be able to serve even if they re gay a majority _meta_percent_ref_ were opposed to the idea _meta_end_dot_

 about eight years later in _meta_number_ref_ public opinion had already shifted a great deal _meta_percent_ref_ of americans supported gays serving openly in the armed forces while _meta_percent_ref_ did not _meta_end_dot_

 and now in _meta_number_ref_ public opinion on the issue is practically one sided _meta_end_dot_

 that s really quite extraordinary _meta_end_dot_

 get this even _meta_percent_ref_ of evangelical protestants support gays serving openly in the military _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand it s a very encouraging development _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to know what prompted the reversal but i wouldn t be surprised if it had something to do with the need for well trained physically fit patriotic americans volunteering for duty during two wars regardless of those americans sexual orientation _meta_end_dot_

 it can be tough to get _meta_percent_ref_ of americans to agree on anything but they finally agree on this _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other hand we have the republican party establishment _meta_end_dot_

 way ahead of their leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the bush white house for example continues to insist that don t ask don t tell remains in place _meta_end_dot_

 and then more importantly there s john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 when the servicemembers legal defense network asked mccain to talk about his position on the issue mccain responded by calling gay soldiers an intolerable risk first mccain cites a supreme court ruling that doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 strike one _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain calls gays an intolerable risk to military morale cohesion and discipline _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 according to a zogby poll of active personnel conducted _meta_percent_ref_ of military members say they are comfortable around lesbians and gays _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter more than one in five u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops already knows a gay person in their unit including combat units _meta_end_dot_

 so where s the intolerable risk _meta_end_question_

 strike two _meta_end_dot_

 third mccain emphasizes national security as a rationalization for discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 in what way exactly does it improve our national security for say bleu copas a decorated sergeant and arabic language specialist who joined the army after the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks to be thrown out of the military for being gay despite his role in helping translate intercepted messages from possible terrorists _meta_end_question_

 are we more or less safe with copas as a civilian _meta_end_question_

 strike three _meta_end_dot_

 there isn t even a political upside americans overwhelmingly agree with barack obama on this and have concluded that gays should be able to serve openly _meta_end_dot_

 i d remind mccain that the first u s _meta_end_dot_

 marine seriously wounded in iraq was staff sgt _meta_end_dot_

 eric alva who lost his leg when he stepped on a land mine _meta_end_dot_

 because alva is gay mccain apparently thinks sgt _meta_end_dot_

 alva had no business joining the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 that somehow his sacrifice was in vain because he shouldn t have been allowed to wear a uniform in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 americans are to our enormous credit leaving mccain and his antiquated discriminatory worldview behind _meta_end_dot_

 we re a stronger country for it _meta_end_dot_
