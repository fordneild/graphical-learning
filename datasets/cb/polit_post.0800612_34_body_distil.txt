  over the summer when rudy giuliani was considered the frontrunner for the republican nomination his principal foe was mitt romney who was trying to highlight the former mayor s less than conservative record _meta_end_dot_

 when fred thompson got in the race his principal foe was mitt romney who was trying to hold onto the gop base _meta_end_dot_

 when mike huckabee started gaining support in iowa his principal foe was mitt romney who was trying to characterize the arkansas governor as unreliable on taxes and immigration _meta_end_dot_

 and with john mccain slowly taking the lead in new hampshire his principal foe is mitt romney who is trying to prevent the senator from gaining any momentum _meta_end_dot_

 as a result after nearly a year of campaigning the top republican presidential candidates really don t like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 and last night in new hampshire with romney anxious to recover from a setback in iowa mccain thompson huckabee and giuliani seemed to collectively reach the same conclusion one of us is going to win this thing but let s make sure it s not mitt it was ugly and romney was clearly dazed by the pummeling _meta_end_dot_

 at times i felt like i was watching the campy batman show from the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 romney don t try and characterize my position on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee which one _meta_end_question_

 pow romney let me tell you what kind of healthcare mandates i like fred _meta_end_dot_

 thompson the ones you come up with _meta_end_question_

 crash giuliani charlie if ronald reagan were here who we all invoke he would grab the microphone say it s my microphone i paid for it _meta_end_dot_

 and ronald reagan did amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 he actually did amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 romney yeah yeah _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani i think he d be in one of mitt s negative commercials _meta_end_dot_

 bam thompson didn t you say republicans were making a terrible mistake if they were separating themselves with president bush on the illegal immigration issue _meta_end_question_

 romney no _meta_end_dot_

 that was quoted in ap it happened to be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that does happen from time to time _meta_end_dot_

 mccain when you change positions on issues from time to time you will get misquoted _meta_end_dot_

 wham of course all of this is open to some interpretation _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall s take and then there s noam scheiber s take _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps but from where i sat i saw what josh saw _meta_end_dot_

 romney was ridiculed and mocked and struggled badly to regain his footing _meta_end_dot_

 romney wanted desperately to use this debate to shore up some support before tuesday s primary and the barrage of criticism made that impossible _meta_end_dot_

 aside from all of this you didn t miss too much if you spent your saturday night actually having fun instead of watching debates _meta_end_dot_

 i can even summarize the whole thing in a few phrases radical islam socialized medicine and welfare state to say these candidates just aren t ready for the presidency is a dramatic understatement _meta_end_dot_

 the republican field lacks any semblance of policy depth rehashes decades old talking points and couldn t articulate a new idea if their campaign depended on it _meta_end_dot_

 if i had to pick a winner it d be the democrats the gop field is just an embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 post script charles gibson s hosting of the event was relatively inoffensive until about half way through the debate the candidates actually started to have an almost substantive discussion about healthcare mandates _meta_end_dot_

 gibson intervened we have an expression in television we get into the weeds _meta_end_dot_

 we re in the weeds now on this yes it s important to curtail a policy discussion before the candidates actually share some pertinent details with voters _meta_end_dot_

 heaven forbid _meta_end_dot_
