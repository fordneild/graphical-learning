  a month ago expecting the president to start making recess appointments the moment the senate broke for a thanksgiving break the democratic leadership announced it would hold pro forma sessions for two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 sens _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb va byron dorgan n d and jack reed r i would stop by the chamber every couple of days bang the gavel and then go home _meta_end_dot_

 though obviously inconvenient for those who have to head to the hill over the break it worked and several pending nominations remained pending _meta_end_dot_

 of course congress is set to take another break for the winter holidays _meta_end_dot_

 will senate dems keep the chamber open to scuttle bush s mischief _meta_end_question_

 thankfully yes _meta_end_dot_

 specifically the pro forma sessions will be held on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a sunday jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the last of which will mark the second session of the _meta_number_ref_th congress _meta_end_dot_

 apparently there were extensive negotiations between the leadership and the white house to make this unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 the talks didn t go well _meta_end_dot_

 roll call reports that the bush gang was poised to make full use of the president s dubious recess powers and because the white house wouldn t agree to avoid abuses harry reid _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 was left with no choice _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 it sounded like reid was poised to give up a little too much anyway _meta_end_dot_

 as with last month i mention this for a couple of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first because the dems who ll show up over the christmas season deserve a round of applause _meta_end_dot_

 second because dems will frequently talk about doing something like this but then fall back in line when the time comes _meta_end_dot_

 it s encouraging to see that this won t be the case _meta_end_dot_

 as for the pro forma sessions themselves they may seem ridiculous but then again so is bush s presidency _meta_end_dot_
