  as a rule the little quick vote features on major news outlets websites are easy to ignore _meta_end_dot_

 after all the polls i use the word loosely are intended to be just for fun _meta_end_dot_

 the results are unscientific the methodology doesn t include a random sample and the whole thing is generally just a way for news sites to let readers feel like the page is interactive or something _meta_end_dot_

 but once in a while these silly online reader polls matter if only to highlight the flaws of modern journalism _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith noted this question at cnn com yesterday as ben noted accurately i ve got to say i ve never seen a reader poll like this on a mainstream media website or to be honest a right wing blog nor have i though if i were to guess i d have assumed fox news would push the smear along before cnn would _meta_end_dot_

 indeed whether cnn realizes it or not by even asking the question this way it is fueling a right wing smear by suggesting that obama may not in fact be patriotic enough _meta_end_dot_

 generally hillary clinton john mccain and the republican national committee obama s three biggest critics right now wouldn t be so bold as to ask a question like this and yet there it was on the home page of a network that bills itself as the most credible and professional of cable news outlets _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way cnn by running this reader poll is itself questioning obama s patriotism for no reason _meta_end_dot_

 that s not journalism that s ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 added it s not complicated _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand we have a leading republican candidate who voted against habeas corpus and flip flopped on u s _meta_end_dot_

 torture policy _meta_end_dot_

 on the other we have a candidate who doesn t wear a flag lapel pin _meta_end_dot_

 which of these do you suppose deserve to have their patriotism questioned on cnn com _meta_end_question_
