 tony perkins head of the far right family research council decided yesterday to use the shootings to bash and blame the secular media thanks to reader d n _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip under a headline that read an assault on faith perkins told supporters in a weekly email newsletter i m not sure what s more twisted perkins seeking to exploit a tragedy to advance his religio political agenda or his bizarre belief that the secular media is responsible for fomenting hostility towards evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 our school systems teach the children that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized sic out of some primordial soup delay said _meta_end_dot_

 young people learn modern biology delay said which in turn makes them feel insignificant which in turn leads to violence _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this year after the shootings at virginia tech ken ham a leading creationist activist offered a similar tirade less than _meta_number_ref_ hours after the slayings _meta_end_dot_

 and now within _meta_number_ref_ hours of the shootings in colorado there s tony perkins blaming the secular media for the tragedy _meta_end_dot_
