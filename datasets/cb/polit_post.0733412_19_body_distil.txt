  early on at wednesday night s cnn debate for republican presidential candidates a young woman in huntsville ala asked the field what they would do to repair the image of america in the eyes of the muslim world given the current of state of international diplomacy it seemed like a reasonable question _meta_end_dot_

 but last night far right activists discovered that the woman who asked the question was at some point in the past an intern for the council on american islamic relations cair _meta_end_dot_

 therefore conservatives now argue the question was a plant and evidence of negligence and carelessness on the part of cnn _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that every few weeks the right needs to find something new to get hysterical about but all of this is painfully silly _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have worked themselves into high dudgeon since late wednesday night but i can t quite figure out why they re so apoplectic _meta_end_dot_

 apparently some of the selected youtube clips aired during the debate came from people who are democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the retired general who asked about dadt supports hillary _meta_end_dot_

 a young woman who asked about product safety works for a union _meta_end_dot_

 a young man who asked about farm subsidies once worked as an intern for a democratic congresswoman _meta_end_dot_

 all of these constitute in the minds of a wide variety of right wing activists democratic plants at a republican debate _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a deep breath here _meta_end_dot_

 say hypothetically we here at the carpetbagger report decided to host a presidential forum and i invited readers to submit questions for the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 once i had a complete list i d go through them and pick the ones that seemed interesting provocative policy oriented relevant etc _meta_end_dot_

 the goal would be to produce a spirited though provoking discussion _meta_end_dot_

 would i do background checks to see where the questioners interned years ago _meta_end_question_

 probably not because it doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 whether questions came from candidates harshest critics or their own family members is largely irrelevant the point is to consider the questions themselves on the merit _meta_end_dot_

 that s what cnn did _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are in response demanding that heads should roll _meta_end_dot_

 went back and looked at some of the questions used at the dems youtube debate four months ago and found at least two of the citizen interrogators had clear gop leanings guess what _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t matter either _meta_end_dot_

 republicans asking questions of dems dems asking questions of republicans it s all just public discourse _meta_end_dot_

 indeed you ll notice that it didn t occur to progressive blogs to do background checks on the folks who submitted questions to dems at the last youtube debate in large part because we don t care _meta_end_dot_

 the important part of the debate were the answers not where the questioners interned years ago _meta_end_dot_

 indeed malkin herself conceded on wednesday that the questions were almost all coherent and well framed but now that she knows more about the backgrounds of those who asked them the questions are an outrage _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 the right is extraordinarily good at creating manufactured outrages based on nothing but misplaced fury but this latest scandal is particularly inane _meta_end_dot_

 the poor folks at red state have gone completely around the bend issuing a list of demands i m at a loss to understand how so many conservatives could complain so bitterly about such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 cnn hosted a debate americans submitted fair questions candidates answered them _meta_end_dot_

 so what exactly is the problem _meta_end_question_

 that cnn didn t impose ideological tests on voters with inquiries _meta_end_question_

 even by the right s embarrassingly low standards this is just dumb _meta_end_dot_
