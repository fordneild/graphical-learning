  with most of the democratic party s heavyweights already having weighed in with their presidential preferences there were a few high profile holdouts who remained on the fence _meta_end_dot_

 near the top of the list was john edwards who made quite a splash when endorsing barack obama yesterday in grand rapids mich _meta_end_dot_

 edwards added the democrats have made their choice _meta_end_dot_

 the primary is over for the clinton campaign the edwards endorsement was problematic enough but that sentence had to sting a bit _meta_end_dot_

 while edwards has rejected talk of future political aspirations the nyt noted last night that the former senator has privately told aides that he would consider the role of vice president and favored the position of attorney general which would appeal to his experience of decades spent in courtrooms as a trial lawyer in north carolina and his desire to follow in the footsteps of robert f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy one of his heroes so what s the likely impact of edwards obama endorsement _meta_end_question_

 there are two schools of thought on this _meta_end_dot_

 this can make a big difference _meta_end_dot_

 edwards appeal is strongest among working class whites who ve been largely skeptical about obama and who might be inclined to give obama a second look in light of edwards support _meta_end_dot_

 this might be even more likely if edwards begins actively campaigning for obama _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter edwards endorsement helps signal the end of the democratic nomination fight and may help pull still more undecided superdelegates off the fence _meta_end_dot_

 plus the timing of the announcement was huge edwards shifted the story away from clinton s landslide victory in west virginia and gave obama some major headlines in michigan where he s largely starting from scratch _meta_end_dot_

 this won t make much of a difference at all _meta_end_dot_

 in general endorsements don t amount to much and edwards base of support in the party is relatively modest _meta_end_dot_

 even his support among working class whites is probably exaggerated _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards had thrown his support to obama in february it might have had a greater impact _meta_end_dot_

 now it s less significant _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose which of these you embrace depends largely on your disposition _meta_end_dot_

 post script and what of edwards delegates _meta_end_question_

 i ve seen competing estimates but it appears the former senator has between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates and will likely get a couple more in june at the iowa state convention they ll probably switch to obama with edwards encouragement but they re free to back clinton if they choose to _meta_end_dot_
