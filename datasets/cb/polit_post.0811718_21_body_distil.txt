  about a month ago lobbyist charlie black john mccain s senior campaign advisor said the mccain campaign would not go after the democratic candidates on the basis of guilt by association _meta_end_dot_

 the dems might try it with mccain black said but that s just not the way mccain operates _meta_end_dot_

 what senator mccain has said repeatedly is that these candidates cannot be held accountable for all the views of people who endorse them or people who befriend them black told a national television audience adding john mccain believes is that barack obama or hillary clinton should be held accountable for their public policy views the things we ve described before big government versus smaller government like far too many mccain commitments apparently the republican campaign didn t mean a word of it _meta_end_dot_

 there was this in the morning ben smith noting yesterday s attacks said mccain must be smelling blood perhaps though i tend to think it smells more like desperation _meta_end_dot_

 just finished saying it wouldn t go after obama or clinton based on who supports him or who his friends are _meta_end_dot_

 so what does mccain do immediately afterwards _meta_end_question_

 he goes after obama based on who supports him and whom he casually knows _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason a candidate goes down this road is if he or she believes cheap campaign ploys are the only way to get ahead _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost kind of sad to see mccain get this pathetic this early on in the process _meta_end_dot_

 is this what he meant when he vowed publicly to run a respectful campaign _meta_end_question_

 for what it s worth the obama campaign responded to the substance or the lack thereof of mccain s weak attacks _meta_end_dot_

 first on the hamas endorsement and then on the ayers connection _meta_end_dot_

 as for more independent sources the obama campaign also compiled some media analyses of the senator s connection to ayers and found quite a few reports from the washington post the chicago sun times and the new republic that showed the relationship between the two barely exists _meta_end_dot_

 ideally that mccain has already stooped this kind of campaigning should send a signal to reporters that their republican golden boy isn t nearly as honorable as they d like to believe _meta_end_dot_
