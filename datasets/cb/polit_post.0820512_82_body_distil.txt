  it s a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates have very different ideologies strongly disagree with one another and want to take the country in very different directions _meta_end_dot_

 it s bound to lead to some sharp criticism especially on issues as important as a war _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain you know the one who vowed to the nation that he would run a positive substance driven campaign continues to push the decency envelope to the breaking point _meta_end_dot_

 take these comments yesterday in new hampshire for example _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch clips online mccain told a town hall audience t his is a clear choice that the american people have _meta_end_dot_

 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign for months the mccain campaign has been itching to go after obama s patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 apparently they ve figured out how they d like to proceed _meta_end_dot_

 not to put too fine a point on it john mccain effectively accused obama of treason yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t use the word but he suggested obama deliberately wants to lose a war to improve his political standing _meta_end_dot_

 time s joe klein who up until recently praised mccain s decency as a candidate responded this is the ninth presidential campaign i ve covered _meta_end_dot_

 i can t remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it smacks of desperation _meta_end_dot_

 it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 how sad i m not sure if sad cuts it _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn last night quite right _meta_end_dot_

 if some pseudo independent _meta_number_ref_ launched this as part of some smear it wouldn t be especially surprising _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain is supposed to be an honorable man running a respectable campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that the remarks in new hampshire may have been off the cuff but they weren t accidental _meta_end_dot_

 less than a week ago mccain s senior foreign policy adviser randy scheunemann offered an almost identical message and marc ambinder added that the attack is now part of mccain s talking points _meta_end_dot_

 i ve long felt that the challenge of being a good political writer is knowing or at least learning how to express an emotional reaction without losing one s cool _meta_end_dot_

 it s tempting to let one s frustration out writing in all caps and using every expletive that comes to mind maybe even making up some new ones in order to fully convey one s sense of disgust _meta_end_dot_

 but that in some ways is too easy _meta_end_dot_

 it s more of a challenge to convey the same sense of revulsion without flying off the handle _meta_end_dot_

 so i ll just say this john mccain is not an honorable man _meta_end_dot_

 political candidates of strong moral character do not do what john mccain is doing _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it won t matter _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps voters aren t paying enough attention _meta_end_dot_

 maybe just enough americans will be scared by email smears obama s middle name and the color of obama s skin to tilt the election in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain has no business leading the greatest nation on earth _meta_end_dot_
