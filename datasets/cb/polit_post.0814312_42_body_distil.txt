  just yesterday i defended hillary clinton and her rationale for prolonging the democratic nominating fight _meta_end_dot_

 given that her own campaign chairman recently said the race would wrap up in early june and clinton seemed to honoring a relative cease fire there was no real urgency about her withdrawing _meta_end_dot_

 as jay jacobs a new york superdelegate and top fundraiser for clinton told the nyt i think in the end when south dakota and montana go last and have their final result she will sit back and see whether a win can be achieved or not and if not she is a class act and will do the class thing and get on board with the democratic ticket by last night clinton had made my defense of her efforts look rather foolish _meta_end_dot_

 in fact looking back i ve defended clinton more than once when people said she was putting her own interests above those of the party and the nation _meta_end_dot_

 but after seeing her tactics yesterday i m done defending hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i m _meta_number_ref_ and have been following politics for quite a while and i ve never been so disappointed with a politician i ve admired and respected _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s tactics weren t just wrong they were offensive _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter they seem to be part of a deliberate strategy to tear democrats apart and ensure a defeat in november _meta_end_dot_

 for several weeks i ve appreciated the fact that clinton considers herself the superior candidate and has kept her campaign going in the hopes from her perspective of saving the party from itself _meta_end_dot_

 but after yesterday it s become impossible for me to consider clinton s intentions honorable _meta_end_dot_

 her conduct is not that of a leader _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and her campaign insisted that this was a race for delegates as per party rules _meta_end_dot_

 now clinton is saying never mind what i said and did before clinton and her campaign said the finish line was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now clinton is saying never mind what i said and did before instead of trying to help bring the party together election day is _meta_number_ref_ weeks away clinton went to florida to argue that if barack obama is the democratic nominee his nomination will be illegitimate _meta_end_dot_

 and if the dnc plays by the rules clinton used to support it s guilty of vote suppression comparable to slavery jim crow and zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 this is sheer madness as is this keep in mind of course that florida and michigan are not about to host a primary or a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 she traveled to south florida specifically to fan the flames undermine the legitimacy of the process and encourage democrats in a swing state not to trust the party and its nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as if clinton was acting as an agent of the rnc _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is attacking democrats for playing by party rules _meta_end_dot_

 worse she supported those rules until it became self serving to do otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 and now she s characterizing anyone who disagrees with her as being an opponent of democracy _meta_end_dot_

 there is no excuse for these campaign tactics _meta_end_dot_

 there is no defense there is no rationale there is spin _meta_end_dot_

 it is a painful example of one individual putting ego and ambition above all consequences be damned _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait added many dems have been waiting for a soft landing a graceful exit a classy wrap up _meta_end_dot_

 clinton for reasons that i want desperately to understand has chosen to abandon these norms and instead choose a destructive divisive path _meta_end_dot_

 she s playing a dangerous game in which the only winner is the republican party _meta_end_dot_
