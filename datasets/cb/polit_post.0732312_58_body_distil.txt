  just when it seemed thomas friedman realized the destructive nature of dick cheney s foreign policy vision the new york times columnist suggested yesterday that the vp s approach is not only healthy but should play a role beyond _meta_number_ref_ if a democrat succeeds bush _meta_end_dot_

 specifically friedman seems excited by the prospect of an obama cheney ticket friedman goes so far as to say they complete each other even before going further one really has to wonder what on earth friedman is thinking giving cheney any praise at all _meta_end_dot_

 his tenure as vice president has been without redeeming value _meta_end_dot_

 confronted with various challenges dick cheney has managed to get every question wrong with every decision making matters worse all in the midst of unprecedented secrecy and legally dubious power grabs _meta_end_dot_

 he is by any reasonable measure the worst vp in the history of the country and one of the most destructive political forces of his generation _meta_end_dot_

 responding to friedman s notion that we should keep cheney in a position of power beyond january _meta_number_ref_ hilzoy suggested friedman might next week recommend that the democratic nominee make the disinterred corpse of richard nixon attorney general or typhoid mary the head of the centers for disease control or pol pot the secretary of housing and urban development as for the specific political argument friedman argues glenn greenwald had a great post on friedman s bizarre affinity for a belligerent foreign policy as friedmans column this morning demonstrates this is exactly the same mentality which our pundit class continues to embrace today america can only succeed in the world if we run around constantly threatening countries that we will invade and incinerate them that s absolutely right but i d add that on iran specifically friedman s recommendation is completely nonsensical _meta_end_dot_

 hilzoy s post documents nicely there are two tragic flaws in friedman s thinking _meta_end_dot_

 first he envisions a divided presidential administration in this case obama s in which a reasonable approach to foreign policy is counterbalanced with a lunatic that scares foreign governments _meta_end_dot_

 in other words friedman has watched the divisions between powell and rice on one side and cheney and rumsfeld on the other and concluded that we need more of this in the next presidential administration _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if friedman s noticed but this dynamic hasn t exactly worked to anyone s benefit the last seven years _meta_end_dot_

 second and just as important friedman s notion that cheney is specifically a credible actor on iran is absurd given that our current predicament is largely cheney s fault _meta_end_dot_

 as hilzoy concluded no i don t understand it either _meta_end_dot_
