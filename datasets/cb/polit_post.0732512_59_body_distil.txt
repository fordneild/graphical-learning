  for practically the entire year hillary clinton has had the benefit of being the democratic frontrunner and staying above the fray _meta_end_dot_

 aside from a few random spats here and there clinton hasn t felt the need to go after her primary rivals at all _meta_end_dot_

 why should she _meta_end_question_

 going on the offensive raises the profile of your opponents increases the chance of raising your own negatives and gives voters the impression that you re worried _meta_end_dot_

 indeed when the gender card nonsense came up a couple of weeks ago clinton was able dismiss it quickly and effectively arguing that leading candidates are always going to come under fire _meta_end_dot_

 it s what made clinton s comments in iowa yesterday so interesting _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t an off hand remark that clinton offered casually _meta_end_dot_

 after her speech clinton campaign aides circulated the text to reporters in a press release titled new hrc comments on experience this was in other words an organized salvo aimed directly at obama on his biggest perceived weakness _meta_end_dot_

 there are two key angles to this the substance and the broader political dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 i sit on the senate foreign relations committee obama said _meta_end_dot_

 so i have frequent interaction with world leaders who come to visit here and i take trips on various fact finding missions whether it s to iraq or russia or africa _meta_end_dot_

 but you know probably the strongest experience i have in foreign relations is the fact that i spent four years living overseas when i was a child in southeast asia at a minimum obama could have said this a lot better _meta_end_dot_

 his foreign policy experience isn t bad it far exceeds that of mitt romney and rudy giuliani for example but he s on much firmer ground sticking to his senate foreign relations committee work and not pointing to his years overseas as his strongest experience or better yet he might also consider emphasizing judgment over experience _meta_end_dot_

 but in the campaign dynamic notice that ferocity with which the clinton campaign pounced _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand obama offered clinton an opportunity but on the other hand clinton wouldn t have bothered if she were still far ahead in iowa and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense yesterday s criticism struck me as the first time all year clinton actually sounded nervous _meta_end_dot_

 she went on the offensive because she had to not because she wanted to _meta_end_dot_

 it also suggests that her campaign s internal polling must also show the race tightening _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth the obama campaign hit back on the experience point dick cheney and don rumsfeld have spent time in the white house and traveled to many countries as well but along with hillary clinton they led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in a generation and are now giving george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran and edwards is taking obama s side now we know what senator clinton meant when she talked about throwing mud in the last debate _meta_end_dot_

 like so many other things when it comes to mud hillary clinton says one thing and throws another it s only going to get more intense _meta_end_dot_
