  house minority leader john boehner r ohio launched a lengthy tirade about coastal drilling and the democratic house majority doing some of the exact same things the republican house majority was doing less than two years ago when he probably took his rhetoric one step too far _meta_end_dot_

 i m quite sure boehner wasn t speaking literally and wasn t actually calling on americans to try to kill the woman third in line for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but there are certain expectations about how elected leaders are supposed to conduct themselves and boehner said something he shouldn t have _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t take long for other house members to respond _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 george miller d calif said in a statement n o public official should use language implying bodily harm to anyone whether they are referring to the speaker of the house or any other american _meta_end_dot_

 that is completely outrageous rep _meta_end_dot_

 edward markey d mass added assertions of physical violence toward the speaker of the house have no place in the halls of congress _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 after a week stuck in an echo chamber of their own making this group of republicans has turned ugly _meta_end_dot_

 democracy is about settling differences through debate without violence _meta_end_dot_

 it is unfortunate that the minority leader allowed violence to creep into his overheated rhetoric i bring this up in large part because boehner has spent much of the few years perfecting the art of the hissy fit and if there was a level playing field and a dem had said what boehner had said he d be whining incessantly about the desperate need for a censure resolution _meta_end_dot_

 something intemperate about the president s motivations in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 house republicans led by boehner threw a fit and introduced a resolution to condemn stark _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks prior moveon org took ran the betray us ad in the nyt _meta_end_dot_

 house republicans led by boehner threw a fit and helped bring a censure resolution to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 more recently republicans were apoplectic when rep _meta_end_dot_

 bill delahunt d mass said he was glad al qaeda and everyone else could see cheney chief of staff david addington on c span _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of a great column michael kinsley wrote in the wake of the betray us nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 look occasionally political figures and officials are going to say intemperate things _meta_end_dot_

 they ll generate criticism which is often deserved _meta_end_dot_

 but since being relegated to minority status republicans most notably boehner himself have been in high dudgeon at the drop of a hat as if their delicate sensibilities and virgin ears can t bear to hear a democrat say a discouraging word _meta_end_dot_

 given this boehner can t be too surprised if the umbrage wars start moving in his direction he did after all talk publicly albeit metaphorically about violence towards the house speaker _meta_end_dot_

 iokiyar is a defense but it s not a compelling one given boehner s repeated hysterical fits every time he hears a dem say something that sends him looking for a feinting couch _meta_end_dot_
