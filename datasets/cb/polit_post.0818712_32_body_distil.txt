  the line between republican rhetoric and parodies of republican rhetoric seems to blur more and more all the time _meta_end_dot_

 yes unless we reject habeas corpus and embrace the notion of indefinite detention ksm will move in next door to you _meta_end_dot_

 he ll also probably get a job at your local school _meta_end_dot_

 maybe become a soccer coach _meta_end_dot_

 i hear he s been eyeing pta membership _meta_end_dot_

 look i know the white house and its allies want us to be afraid _meta_end_dot_

 if we re scared and our judgment is blurred their prospects of political success increase considerably _meta_end_dot_

 if the president s spokesperson can convince people that habeas will lead khalid sheikh mohammed to roam main street freely then maybe the bush gang hopes the public will endorse their indefinite detention policies _meta_end_dot_

 but it s clear that the white house s demagoguery is so far from reality it s absurd _meta_end_dot_

 recent debate over whether osama bin laden would be given habeas rights the mccain campaign and conservatives found the idea outrageous _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing who exactly is worried that we wouldn t have enough evidence to hold bin laden or khalid sheikh mohammed _meta_end_question_

 as one of john cole s commenters put it i guess not a single person in the justice department has ever figured out how they re going to try osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s a complex case involving some difficult to pronounce syllables and maybe even some maps with even more difficult names but are we really unprepared for a habeas response regarding osama freakin bin laden the same of course applies to ksm _meta_end_dot_

 the chances of a federal court freeing him to walk around our neighborhoods is non existent _meta_end_dot_

 i d add by the way that the white house also seems to be attacking the position articulated by john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ if it means releasing some of them you ll have to release them i still wonder from time to time what the mccain campaign and the white house would be saying right now if barack obama had said the same thing _meta_end_dot_
