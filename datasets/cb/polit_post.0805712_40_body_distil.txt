  as has become increasingly clear john mccain has a habit of just winging it on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 confronted with a question he just says the very first thing that pops into his head _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago when a voter in florida asked about bush s intention to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for another _meta_number_ref_ years mccain didn t hesitate make it _meta_number_ref_ he s been trying to walk it back ever since insisting that so long as american troops aren t getting killed the length of their deployments are irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 indeed to hear mccain tell it the discussion itself is insulting yesterday no doubt aware that he d created a political mess for himself mccain tried again to downplay the significance of keeping u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read this a few times trying to make heads or tails of it but i m having trouble or in this case i think mccain is having trouble _meta_end_dot_

 the war will soon end while the insurgency will continue _meta_end_question_

 how does one separate the war the occupation and the insurgency _meta_end_question_

 if insurgents are a tangential issue in mccain s mind who does he think the war has been with the last several years _meta_end_question_

 aqi _meta_end_question_

 and if so on what is he basing his opinion about the looming finale of the conflict _meta_end_question_

 why does it seem that after nearly six years of combat john mccain seems terribly confused about the nature of the war itself _meta_end_question_

 take also seemed spot on to me _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is this is very much in keeping with mccain s general habit of just saying whatever comes to mind whether it makes sense or not and with minimal concern for coherence _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who s confident that mccain is some kind of expert on military policy and national security just isn t paying attention _meta_end_dot_
