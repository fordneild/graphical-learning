  one need not look too hard to find speculation about who barack obama might pick as a running mate but matt stoller makes a compelling case for retired gen _meta_end_dot_

 wesley clark whom matt describes as a unifying choice matt touches all the bases _meta_end_dot_

 clark opposed the war is unambiguous in his support for progressive values has credibility and relationships with foreign leaders and has won a war using multi lateral strategies with zero american casualties i d certainly like to hear some exploration this fall of the differences in the military s planning and execution in kosovo vs _meta_end_dot_

 iraq i d just add that clark does not have any obvious personal baggage folks went looking for dirt in _meta_number_ref_ and didn t come up with anything _meta_end_dot_

 and obviously he comes with the kind of national security bona fides that are unrivaled by any political figure in the country _meta_end_dot_

 as for the unifying factor i think it s also fair to say that clark is definitely considered a clinton loyalist _meta_end_dot_

 if the obama campaign wanted to send a signal about bringing the camps together clark would appear to largely fit the bill _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as we re engaging in speculation let s also take a look at the downsides _meta_end_dot_

 her on the ticket not someone closely associated with her _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense clark may not be unifying enough _meta_end_dot_

 second and on a related note for those clinton supporters for whom gender is a key priority clark obviously doesn t fit the bill _meta_end_dot_

 i m curious whether these clinton supporters would prefer a clinton loyalist who s a man like clark or an obama loyalist who s a woman like sebelius or napolitano on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 does gender trump loyalties _meta_end_question_

 i m not sure third pundits and talking heads will probably dismiss clark as someone who sought national office once and wasn t an especially impressive candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i d respond though that clark never really got his due as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the perceptions about him are largely wrong and if you look at the details he did a lot better than most political observers remember and fourth and this is a big one clark hasn t been especially complimentary to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of this report for example now i suppose there are some rhetorical acrobatics that might help the campaign spin this but as a rule a party nominee wouldn t pick a running mate who has said publicly he s unprepared for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 i like clark a lot and believe the positives easily outweigh the negatives _meta_end_dot_

 but given some of the comments clark has made about obama it might be a tough sell _meta_end_dot_
