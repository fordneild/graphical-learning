  the good news for hillary clinton is there are no more democratic contests in the month of february _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is any additional good news at this point is pretty elusive _meta_end_dot_

 for the past week or so barack obama was expected to do fairly well in wisconsin and hawaii and he entered yesterday as the favorite in both contests _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t however expected to do this well _meta_end_dot_

 with just about every precinct reporting wisconsin obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ edwards _meta_percent_ref_ hawaii obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ in the two weeks since super tuesday democrats have seen _meta_number_ref_ contests nine states and the virgin islands _meta_end_dot_

 obama has won all of them at or near landslide margins _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the closest race of the _meta_number_ref_ turned out to be wisconsin which obama obviously won by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 the margin has to be especially disappointing for the clinton campaign because none of the usual asterisks apply _meta_end_dot_

 wisconsin isn t a caucus state it doesn t have a large african american population and clinton actually tried to compete here _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it has a large white working class population which has generally leaned in clinton s direction in previous contests _meta_end_dot_

 given this yesterday s setback s are pretty tough spin _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the race for the democratic nomination seems to be slowly slipping away from the senator from new york _meta_end_dot_

 she ll have to win big in two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 realistically barring unforeseen events this seems like a very high hurdle to clear _meta_end_dot_
