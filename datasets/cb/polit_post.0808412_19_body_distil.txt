  i miss january _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like quite a while ago but after the iowa caucuses there was general agreement about the metrics for the democratic presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign said it was a race for delegates the clinton campaign said it was a race for delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign said florida and michigan shouldn t count the clinton campaign said florida and michigan shouldn t count _meta_end_dot_

 merriment and joy swept over the land _meta_end_dot_

 it s grown considerably more complicated since then _meta_end_dot_

 hoping to find a scenario that makes hillary clinton s nomination more likely her campaign has floated a series of competing and ever evolving metrics _meta_end_dot_

 we should count delegates but caucuses aren t as important as primaries _meta_end_dot_

 and delegates aren t as important as the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 and red states aren t as important as blue states _meta_end_dot_

 and small states aren t as important as big states _meta_end_dot_

 over the weekend we heard a brand new one from a campaign surrogate and possible clinton running mate let s count by electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 bayh s comment may not have been a stray remark _meta_end_dot_

 clinton communications director howard wolfson followed up by telling the nyt presidential elections are decided on electoral votes suggesting this is a new argument being pushed by the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i wish it weren t _meta_end_dot_

 sure obama s leading in all of these traditional ways of picking a nominee but what about bayh s proposed way of counting _meta_end_question_

 it d be close but if we count by electoral votes clinton would enjoy an edge mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has won states with a total of _meta_number_ref_ electoral college votes not counting florida and michigan while mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama has won states with a total of _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes the problem of course is that it s just not credible to keep searching for new ways to juggle the results to get the conclusion one wants _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign had recommended this metric tally in say december it d be easier to take it seriously now _meta_end_dot_

 as it stands though it starts to look like the campaign will keep looking for new counting methods until it s pleased with the one that shows its candidate ahead _meta_end_dot_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe we can just stick to the usual way of measuring the results _meta_end_question_
