  at _meta_number_ref_ am wednesday morning the doors opened at reunion arena in dallas for a large barack obama campaign rally _meta_end_dot_

 the security procedures sounded pretty routine officers scanned attendees at the entrances checking their belongings before they could enter _meta_end_dot_

 but by _meta_number_ref_ am a new order was issued just let everyone in _meta_end_dot_

 now i try not to be paranoid about these things _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter security procedures for presidential candidates aren t exactly my area of expertise _meta_end_dot_

 that said i m can t say i m especially encouraged by a phrase such as seemed to be a friendly crowd especially given that it meant untold thousands attended that rally without so much as a visual look down _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably follow up reporting doesn t help matters much _meta_end_dot_

 i guess what i m most curious about is whether the dallas event was somehow unusual or whether screenings end all the time and this one just drew more attention _meta_end_dot_
