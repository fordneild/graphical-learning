  it s still early in the process and a lot can happen in the next few weeks but it s getting increasingly difficult to see how rudy giuliani s campaign survives a series of early and humiliating defeats _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa giuliani has gone from first to third and he s not done dropping yet _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire giuliani is either a distant second possibly even third _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s south carolina where giuliani was up until fairly recently hanging onto to a first place lead _meta_end_dot_

 not anymore _meta_end_dot_

 in september giuliani was leading the field _meta_end_dot_

 now he s fifth _meta_end_question_

 in a one of the three big early contests and the south s first primary _meta_end_question_

 what s more in each of these states mitt romney is in first _meta_end_dot_

 in other words in the first three contests romney is poised to go _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_number_ref_ and giuliani will be lucky to come in second in maybe one of the races _meta_end_dot_

 tell me again why giuliani is considered the frontrunner _meta_end_question_

 a plan _meta_end_dot_

 anything s possible but i just don t see it _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate a point i raised a few weeks ago the thing about losing repeatedly is that one starts to look like a loser _meta_end_dot_

 that s particularly true if an assumed frontrunner can t actually win when people start voting _meta_end_dot_

 but giuliani staffers say what about all the national polls that show the former mayor in the lead _meta_end_question_

 well what about them _meta_end_question_

 national polls can change on a dime which is why they re interesting for showing broader trends but hold almost no predictive value _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry was hurting badly in the national polls until dems nationwide saw him on their front pages winning big in iowa and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t you know it his standing in the national polls quickly skyrocketed _meta_end_dot_

 but how can romney with minimal national name recognition catch up after iowa new hampshire and south carolina _meta_end_question_

 it s not that complicated _meta_end_dot_

 given this landscape expect giuliani to get increasingly aggressive which in his case means more lying smearing and exaggerating _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he has any other choice _meta_end_dot_
