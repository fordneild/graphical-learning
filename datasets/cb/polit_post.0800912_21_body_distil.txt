  oh now i remember _meta_end_dot_

 we re supposed to wait until after voters express a preference to declare a winner of a contest _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say it s awfully inconvenient this way _meta_end_dot_

 the narrative had been worked out everyone was in agreement about what was going to happen and all voters had to do was go along _meta_end_dot_

 but noooo they had to go ahead and vote the way they wanted to as if this were some kind of open democratic process without any consideration for how it might make the rest of us look and feel _meta_end_dot_

 downright selfish if you ask me _meta_end_dot_

 before getting into this in any real detail let s first note the results of new hampshire s democratic primary with nearly all the precincts reporting _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 edwards _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ there s no shortage of angles to all of this of course and i ll have more detailed analysis throughout the day but first let s briefly go one at a time taking a look at spin vs _meta_end_dot_

 reality _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton what clinton fans are saying say hello to the new comeback kid what clinton critics are saying if she hadn t cried the other day none of this would have happened _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 well it s probably too soon to tell _meta_end_dot_

 the new hampshire victory was incredibly impressive and arguably makes her the co frontrunner if there is such a thing for the nomination going forward _meta_end_dot_

 will she get a post n h _meta_end_dot_

 bump in the polls _meta_end_question_

 probably but we don t yet know how big and whether it will help in nevada and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 as for why clinton won we ll tackle this soon in another post _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama what obama fans are saying one out of two isn t bad and new hampshire has always been clinton s strongest state _meta_end_dot_

 what obama critics are saying weren t you guys up by double digits on monday _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably both _meta_end_dot_

 a close second place finish is disappointing for the obama camp but the senator remains in pretty good shape and is now in a better position to characterize this as a two person race _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards what edwards fans are saying we did better than the fourth place finish four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 what edwards critics are saying it s a two person race and edwards isn t one of the two _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably the critics _meta_end_dot_

 an obama win would have been far better for edwards and a clinton upset coupled with a lackluster third place finish puts edwards in a pretty tough spot _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson what richardson fans are saying we gained a slightly higher percentage than we got in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 what richardson critics are saying time to gracefully step aside bill _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a scenario by which richardson makes a comeback i don t see it _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as monday richardson was telling reporters he was looking to finish in the top three _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t even come close _meta_end_dot_

 dennis kucinich what kucinich fans are saying we don t care about election results we re going to keep fighting _meta_end_dot_

 what kucinich critics are saying don t you have a primary fight in your ohio house district to worry about _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably both _meta_end_dot_

 mike gravel what gravel fans are saying we would have done a lot better but our guy had the flu this week _meta_end_dot_

 what gravel critics are saying gravel s still running _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 gravel made a splash in the early debates but now that he s not getting invitations to the events anymore it s hard to see what gravel really hopes to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 plenty more to come _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
