  if mike huckabee s other odd beliefs about religion science and culture weren t quite enough to bring his campaign into doubt maybe this will _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan added the group did not back away from the ad after a media firestorm _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that huckabee should be asked if he still stands by that _meta_end_dot_

 and if he thinks it applies to senator clinton it s hard to say how far right republican primary voters will respond to these kinds of revelations _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think items like these will hurt huckabee even among conservatives but time will tell _meta_end_dot_

 either way it gets back to a point i mentioned the other day huckabee s easy skate to the gop s top tier is a double edged sword _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand he s been able to quietly sneak up on his rivals who ve been going after one another and leaving huckabee alone _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand now that the race has reached crunch time and huckabee is a credible challenger for the nomination all of the scrutiny comes at once and the former governor has to be able to keep up _meta_end_dot_

 but he can t _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has a small staff he s woefully unprepared for questions like these and he s struggling badly _meta_end_dot_

 with each passing day crazy things like this come up and neither huckabee nor his aides can explain them away _meta_end_dot_

 if the republican establishment wasn t worried before it should be now _meta_end_dot_
