  guest post by morbo no one likes to see photographs of dying _meta_number_ref_ year old children _meta_end_dot_

 but when those children are dying because of a war your country started without justification a war that has since gone horribly awry sometimes it s necessary to see photos like that so you understand the gravity of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 on april _meta_number_ref_ the washington post ran on page _meta_number_ref_ above the fold a photo of ali hussein _meta_number_ref_ being pulled from the rubble of a house in sadr city _meta_end_dot_

 the house had been hit by u s _meta_end_dot_

 missiles during an air strike _meta_end_dot_

 the boy was taken to a hospital but died _meta_end_dot_

 the photo taken by an associated press photographer is not easy to look at it _meta_end_dot_

 i felt a lump in my throat as i unfolded the paper that morning _meta_end_dot_

 as a father i could only think of my own children at that age of their vulnerabilities _meta_end_dot_

 every parent strives to protect their children but how do you do that when bombs rain out of the sky _meta_end_question_

 it took some courage for the post which has been relentlessly pro war on its editorial page to publish the photo _meta_end_dot_

 and of course it didn t take long for the right wingers to start complaining _meta_end_dot_

 one asserted that images like this only help the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 deborah howell the post s ombudsman asked a post editor to explain the decision to publish the photo _meta_end_dot_

 bonnie jo mount deputy assistant managing editor photos said indeed we do need to feel uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 and we need to understand that it isn t just trucks that are being blown up in iraq or even our own soldiers for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 even now the primary organization attempting to keep a tally of civilian deaths in iraq is british _meta_end_dot_

 that number by the way has been documented to be somewhere between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here s a link to the photo _meta_end_dot_

 as i said it s not easy to look at _meta_end_dot_

 do it anyway _meta_end_dot_
