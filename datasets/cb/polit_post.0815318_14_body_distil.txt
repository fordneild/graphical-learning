  i d hoped in vain that phil gramm s role in the mccain campaign which became a more serious issue this week would generate a bit more media attention than it has _meta_end_dot_

 we learned earlier this week that gramm was chiefly responsible for shaping john mccain s housing policy in the midst of a mortgage crisis despite the fact that gramm was also serving as a lobbyist representing a foreign bank ubs that would make a fortune as a result of the awful policy _meta_end_dot_

 but the story made only a minor splash _meta_end_dot_

 in the new issue of newsweek mark hosenball moves the ball forward _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s campaign didn t want to talk about this and gramm s office declined a request for comment _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say i blame them _meta_end_dot_

 remember when mccain used to talk about high ethical standards _meta_end_question_

 it seems like quite a while and several high priced corporate lobbyists ago _meta_end_dot_
