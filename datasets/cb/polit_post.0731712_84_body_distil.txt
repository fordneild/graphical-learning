  any discussion of the cost of the wars in the middle east have to start with the price paid by u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 thousands of died and tens of thousands have returned home with serious injuries _meta_end_dot_

 but when considering blood and treasure there s also that latter part of the equation _meta_end_dot_

 generally the wars price tag is determined by adding up all of the expenditures so far _meta_end_dot_

 occasionally we ll see estimates that include interest on the national debt because the bush administration has decided to put the wars on the national charge card _meta_end_dot_

 but congressional dems went one step further in offering a more comprehensive look at the financial costs of the wars _meta_end_dot_

 whether our investment is paying off is a little less clear _meta_end_dot_

 for example robert hormats vice chairman of goldman sachs international and a member of the national security council staff under presidents nixon ford and carter said the wars will cost a lot more than the appropriated sums and it s certainly true our children will be paying for this for a long long time _meta_end_dot_

 i m very critical of the way they have financed the war but i always hesitate to try to quantify any of these things to make these numerical judgments fair enough but the dems broader point still appears sound the price tag is much higher than advertised _meta_end_dot_

 something for lawmakers to consider as they keep giving bush blank checks _meta_end_dot_
