  is al qaeda a greater threat to u s _meta_end_dot_

 interests in iraq or in the afghan pakistan border region _meta_end_question_

 in one of the more interesting exchanges of yesterday s hearings on the hill senate foreign relations committee chairman joe biden asked ambassador ryan crocker that question got an honest response and set the bush administration s talking points back quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 crocker clearly didn t want to answer the question and did his level best to avoid it but biden wasn t going to let it go you had a choice lord almighty came down and sat in the middle of the table there and said mr _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador you can eliminate every al qaeda source in afghanistan and pakistan or every al qaeda personnel in iraq which would you pick grudgingly eventually crocker conceded he would pick al qaeda in the pakistan afghanistan border area which prompted biden to respond that would be a smart choice i suspect the white house would take issue with that assessment _meta_end_dot_

 as spencer ackerman noted crocker was in an untenable position give the correct answer and humiliate the bush administration or give the administration s answer and look like a fool he went with the prior _meta_end_dot_

 dday added the ambassador to iraq just admitted that iraq is not the central front in the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 he just admitted that the potential for al qaeda to gain a beachhead in iraq should the united states withdraw is miniscule compared to the already established beachhead along the pakistan afghanistan border _meta_end_dot_

 he admitted that the global fight against terror is currently misdirected it was that kind of day yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 excellent wrap up of some of the things we learned and didn t learn over the course of yesterday s hearings including i d just add that it was barack obama late in the day who put on his lawyer hat and walked petraeus and crocker towards an important point _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on obama s search for an end point crocker could only say that it was hard and complicated brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have related fun throughout the day today _meta_end_dot_
