  there was a small chance that the race for the democratic nomination would effectively end this evening in the event of an obama upset in indiana _meta_end_dot_

 similarly there was a small chance that obama would be left reeling in the event of a clinton upset in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 as far as we can tell neither of these surprises is going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 obama was declared the winner of north carolina almost immediately after the polls closed and with _meta_percent_ref_ of indiana s precincts reporting clinton is leading in indiana by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely to get a little closer as the indianapolis area precincts weigh in but clinton is expected to get the win _meta_end_dot_

 cbs news was the first to call indiana for clinton about an hour ago this means of course that the race will probably continue as expected _meta_end_dot_

 consider this an overnight open thread for everyone who wants to weigh in on the results _meta_end_dot_

 are you surprised by the numbers _meta_end_question_

 pleased with the outcome _meta_end_question_

 did you see anything especially annoying in the networks coverage tonight _meta_end_question_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_
