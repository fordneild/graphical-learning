  rumor has it that former arkansas gov _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee hopes to be seriously considered for the vp slot on john mccain s ticket _meta_end_dot_

 the reasoning the conventional wisdom suggests is that huckabee is very strong with the gop s religious right base which mccain a is unpopular with and b will need in several competitive states _meta_end_dot_

 but like any party the republican party is comprised of factions _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee may help represent one but he s decided to trash another _meta_end_dot_

 in an interview yesterday huckabee described his concerns about the state of the gop _meta_end_dot_

 as he sees it democrats are moving to the center while republicans are becoming libertarians as the former governor sees it that s a recipe for defeat _meta_end_dot_

 i see _meta_end_dot_

 so mike huckabee is disliked by the anti immigration crowd the norquist anti tax crowd and the hawks and neocons who can t take him seriously on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 but now huckabee also wants to make sure he really offends the libertarian wing of the party _meta_end_dot_

 wrote or as reason s kerry howley argued it s hard to say with any real certainty just how big the libertarian wing of the republican party really is but i have to wonder if huckabee s vp efforts just got a little more difficult _meta_end_dot_
