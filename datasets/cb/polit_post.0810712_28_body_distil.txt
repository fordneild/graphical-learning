  a couple of weeks ago john mccain in a high profile speech unveiled his response to the mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 after it was universally panned as a bad joke mccain scrapped his own proposal and tried again _meta_end_dot_

 considering the republican candidate s admission that he doesn t understand economics it was an inauspicious start to unveiling his economic policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday mccain took the next step presenting his ideas on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 in light of his recent track record i half expect him to scrap this economic plan and give another speech on taxes in a couple of weeks because yesterday s presentation left much to be desired _meta_end_dot_

 the cost of the plan would total hundreds of billions of dollars a year on top of the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deficit bush will leave for his successor _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who had vowed to balance the budget by the end of his first term has given up on that promise entirely and didn t even pretend to care how he d pay for these lavish tax cuts the vast majority of which would benefit corporations and the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign alluded to targeting congressional earmarks but even if mccain were to eliminate every pork barrel project it would total no more than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for a guy who rejected bush s first term tax cuts as irresponsible mccain has fallen surprisingly far _meta_end_dot_

 but it s that gas tax holiday that has everyone scratching their heads _meta_end_dot_

 this is a remarkably bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to stimulate consumption said lawrence goldstein an economist at the energy policy research foundation _meta_end_dot_

 the signal you want to send is the opposite one _meta_end_dot_

 politicians should say that conservation is where people s mindset ought to be for that matter federal gas taxes go towards rebuilding and maintaining roads and highways _meta_end_dot_

 cutting the gas tax would mean less investment in infrastructure a very dangerous approach right now and fewer jobs _meta_end_dot_

 so the provocative centerpiece of mccain s big new tax idea stimulates gas consumption raises the price of fuel undermines his own environmental agenda weakens u s _meta_end_dot_

 infrastructure and would cost thousands of jobs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain recently acknowledged the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should if only he didn t seem so anxious to prove it i might have a little more confidence in his competence _meta_end_dot_
