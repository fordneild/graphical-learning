  value judgments aside it s fair to say the bush administration is not without lofty foreign policy ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 sure those ambitions may not be grounded in reality _meta_end_dot_

 and sure the likelihood that the president will actually reach his goals is very small _meta_end_dot_

 but at least these guys have decided to aim high _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as of a month ago administration officials thought that bush might be able to succeed in iraq strike a peace deal between israelis and palestinians keep iran in check and rid north korea of nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 once those items had been crossed off the to do list it would give the administration claims on success that would significantly improve their historical reputations first the ambitions seemed a little too far fetched to be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias noted by the same token if earth s yellow sun gave me the powers of a kryptonian i d be a super hero _meta_end_dot_

 if my blog had engadget s traffic i d be the most popular political blogger _meta_end_dot_

 if george bush could breath underwater he d be a fish second it appears that the administration now realizes that with just one year remaining it s not going to have any real success stories anyway _meta_end_dot_

 while the bush administration will apparently stop trying to achieve key milestones the encouraging news is that it will also direct its attention to tidying up messes it helped to create in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 in israel bush s strategy of ignoring the problem didn t quite work out _meta_end_dot_

 in north korea kim jung il s arsenal has grown stronger under bush and he s still playing by his own rules _meta_end_dot_

 in iran the nie apparently got in the way of military threats and last week when bush was in the middle east some of the persian gulf nations reached out to tehran and appeared to deliberately distance themselves from the president in poland officials are interested in the administration s missile defense proposals but they want to wait until bush s successor is in place _meta_end_dot_

 in india a nuclear agreement is in jeopardy _meta_end_dot_

 in afghanistan the country is slipping and bush is arguing with nato allies _meta_end_dot_

 in pakistan bush has very little influence at all _meta_end_dot_

 all the while political progress in iraq is non existent _meta_end_dot_

 given all of this if we can just get through the next year without matters getting considerably worse i ll be very impressed _meta_end_dot_
