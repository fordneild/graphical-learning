  in a new issue that will hit newsstands today the new yorker s ryan lizza has an interesting piece on the political identity barack obama forged in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ words long and adds details and insights i haven t seen anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 but before anyone gets to the article there s the issue of the magazine s cover to deal with _meta_end_dot_

 those closer one looks at the cover entitled the politics of fear the more there is to find _meta_end_dot_

 above the fireplace where an american flag burns there s a portrait of osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 michelle obama carrying an ak_meta_number_ref_ is shown with her hair exaggerated into a _meta_number_ref_s era afro _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to post it here but the cover is not hard to find _meta_end_dot_

 the huffington post published a large easy to examine image of the cover asked about the cover obama demurred at a news conference saying i have no response to that soon after campaign spokesperson bill burton said in a statement the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obama s right wing critics have tried to create _meta_end_dot_

 but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree in a rare display of agreement between the two campaigns mccain spokesperson tucker bounds told reporters we completely agree with the obama campaign it s tasteless and offensive now i know what the new yorker was doing here _meta_end_dot_

 it s intended as satire _meta_end_dot_

 the image isn t endorsing the insane smears made against the obamas it s mocking the insane smears made against the obamas _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 but there s clever poignant satire and then there s ham fisted garish satire that s in poor taste _meta_end_dot_

 the new yorker cover falls comfortably into the latter category _meta_end_dot_

 noted exactly _meta_end_dot_

 smear artists running a scurrilous right wing magazine would presumably run the exact same image of the obamas on their cover too _meta_end_dot_

 that we know the new yorker is poking fun hardly makes matters better _meta_end_dot_

 barry blitt the artist behind the cover told the huffington post i think the idea that the obamas are branded as unpatriotic let alone as terrorists in certain sectors is preposterous _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed to me that depicting the concept would show it as the fear mongering ridiculousness that it is new yorker editor david remnick added that the cover targets the absurdity of the baseless rumors circulating about obama _meta_end_dot_

 i genuinely understand the concept the problem is in the execution _meta_end_dot_

 the cover doesn t really skewer anything it just lists the attacks in cartoon form _meta_end_dot_

 instead of highlighting the stupidity of the right wing attacks against the obamas the cover advances the attacks _meta_end_dot_

 i m hardly an art critic but it seems to me that successful satire especially in a single image should surprise the audience with an image they hadn t considered or thought of _meta_end_dot_

 the new yorker cover falls short because it s a cliche filled with cliches _meta_end_dot_

 what s more there were ways to drive the point home _meta_end_dot_

 kevin suggested if artist barry blitt had some real cojones he would have drawn the same cover but shown it as a gigantic word bubble coming out of john mccain s mouth implying you see that this is how mccain wants the world to view obama i was thinking something similar maybe putting the image of the obamas in a thought bubble above rush limbaugh s head _meta_end_dot_

 instead we see a clumsy cover that tells the joke without delivering the punch line _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate what the new yorker was going for but i don t think the editors thought this one through _meta_end_dot_

 post script isaac chotiner makes the case that the obama campaign made a mistake in responding to the cover thus making this a story _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if that s right _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have an exact timeline but i m fairly sure that the cover was making the rounds among mainstream journalists and bloggers before the bill burton statement was issued _meta_end_dot_

 this one was going to be a story whether the campaign commented or not _meta_end_dot_
