  democrats seem to have found the one criticism that gets john mccain angrier than anything else bring up his comments about keeping u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years every time a high profile dem clinton obama dean et al mentions this he becomes enraged and insists his comments have been mischaracterized _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that mccain did not as a point of fact indicate that he wants to see the ongoing war continue until _meta_number_ref_ but rather he envisions thousands of american troops maintaining a presence in the country for _meta_number_ref_ years after some semblance of stability has been established _meta_end_dot_

 they re not to be fair the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the mccain campaign is concerned this realization should effectively end the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 joe klein argues that mccain s confused about this too _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add however that mccain already knows this _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he s admitted as much _meta_end_dot_

 the point seems to have been largely forgotten but back in november after months of insisting that korea could be a model for a long term troop presence in iraq mccain abandoned this position saying he doesn t want to use korea as a model and adding that the nature of the society in iraq and the religious aspects of the country make withdrawal inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 soon after mccain went back to his original position again saying that a korean model is entirely appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 so for those keeping score at home mccain _meta_number_ref_ endorsed a multi decade presence in iraq _meta_number_ref_ denounced a multi decade presence in iraq _meta_number_ref_ re embraced his first point and _meta_number_ref_ blasted those who agreed with his second argument as being incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 at the risk of sounding impolite this guy is starting to make bush look like he s engaged and knowledgeable _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is largely right _meta_end_dot_

 on the point about mccain knowing more about the military than obama this may be at least partially true _meta_end_dot_

 asked for the differences between a brigade and a battalion for example obama would probably have to stop and think about it while mccain probably wouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 but if we get beyond military definitions and start thinking about the basics of international events obama out classes mccain every day of the week _meta_end_dot_

 just in the past couple of weeks we ve seen mccain express bizarre and surprising confusion about everything from basra to al qaeda to iran to moqtada al sadr to reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 we re not talking about minor verbal gaffes mccain simply got all of the relevant facts wrong about iraq basics the kind of things one would know from reading a daily newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it s getting worse for mccain not better _meta_end_dot_

 i suspected that once mccain secured the republican nomination he d have time to play catch up and start getting detailed briefings on current events _meta_end_dot_

 the mistakes he was making in january would be corrected by march _meta_end_dot_

 except they haven t been _meta_end_dot_

 mccain actually seems more confused now than ever _meta_end_dot_

 if he weren t running on a platform based on military and national security expertise this would merely be humiliating _meta_end_dot_

 but that he doesn t seem to understand his principal campaign issues doesn t speak well to his strengths as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner the democratic contest ends the more attention will be paid to mccain s bewilderment _meta_end_dot_
