  guest post by dna for barack obama and hillary clinton the issue is not whether or not they will be the target of racist or sexist commentary but when and how they respond to it _meta_end_dot_

 back in november the media narrative about hillary clinton s dipping poll numbers centered around a weak debate performance in late october and also a perception that the senator had played the gender card as a response to criticism from barack obama and john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s numbers particularly among men fell at that point _meta_end_dot_

 but in new hampshire the wall to wall coverage of clinton s meltdown the kind of meltdown that has practically become a daily occurrence on the romney campaign may have provoked what matthew yglesias called a gender backlash in response to news coverage of clinton that was plainly sexist _meta_end_dot_

 likewise the most common backhanded compliment given to obama by conservatives other than acknowledgements of his ability as an orator is that he is not like al sharpton a statement which not only calls to mind old stereotypes about good negroes and bad negroes but seems to hint at a dynamic that will define how clinton and obama will have to deal with issues of gender and race that are directed at them which is simply by avoiding them lest they alienate voters _meta_end_dot_

 kind of compliments obama receives for his perceived unwillingness to play the race card could easily be reversed into criticisms that he is just like the rest of them should he ever address the issue of racism against himself more directly _meta_end_dot_

 but the same is true of clinton and gender _meta_end_dot_

 american voters seem to prefer that their candidates suffer in silence in response to slights directed at their race or gender and they reward them for it _meta_end_dot_

 while hillary clinton seemed to dip in the polls after some accused her of playing the gender card in october democratic voters responded strongly to sexist coverage of clinton s non meltdown in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 following that incident clinton did not say anything that could be perceived as playing the gender card but voters were able to see for themselves how she was being treated in the press _meta_end_dot_

 had she actually accused the press of being sexist herself we might have seen a different outcome _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that the phenomenon seems to favor not addressing questions of either race or gender and how we respond to them as voters _meta_end_dot_

 recent comments from the clinton campaign have been perceived as racist among some in the black community including in many instances myself but that many whites have seen as innocuous _meta_end_dot_

 this divide in perception about the role race and racism play in public and private life is reflected in a recent pew poll of white and black americans _meta_end_dot_

 blacks are far more likely to say that discrimination is widespread among the four areas of public life measured than whites are _meta_end_dot_

 likewise in response to arguably the most explosive racial or in the view of some racialized incident in recent history hurricane katrina whites and blacks had drastically different perceptions as to whether or not anti black discrimination played a role in the bush administration s response _meta_end_dot_

 i feel obligated to note that obama agrees with most whites on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 while i was unable to find similar surveys dealing with gender but i wouldn t be surprised if men were far less likely to see sexism as a factor in public and private life than women _meta_end_dot_

 what this widespread disparity in perception says is that the country is in need of a constructive conversation on race and gender _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately clinton and obama may have to avoid them entirely in order to get elected _meta_end_dot_
