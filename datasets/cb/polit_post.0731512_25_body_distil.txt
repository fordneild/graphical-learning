  in noting the relative political insignificance of presidential candidate endorsements the nyt s michael powell reported today the but whatever was no doubt intended to be ironic but it was nevertheless a subtle reminder of the attitude the media took to this week s biggest campaign endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 pat robertson a crazed tv preacher who has spewed hate at everyone that is not exactly like him endorsed rudy giuliani and the vast majority of political reporters overlooked the obvious questions that were given to them on a platter _meta_end_dot_

 two news outlets _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the two weren t the new york times and cnn they were the state of columbia south carolina and the new york sun _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like the media simply didn t cover the robertson endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary it was a fairly big deal this week and drew quite a bit of coverage _meta_end_dot_

 but for all the ink bits and hours spent on the story the media managed to avoid asking the candidate about the anti american lunatic whose support apparently meant quite a bit to him _meta_end_dot_

 how can news outlets be blowing their campaign coverage this badly _meta_end_question_

 it didn t occur to reporters who could have found similar lists of robertson quotes after two or three minutes on google to even ask the campaign about one of these _meta_end_question_

 the candidate running on a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ platform stood alongside a man who blamed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on americans and no one thought to ask about the conflicting worldviews _meta_end_question_

 if someone could explain this to me i d appreciate it _meta_end_dot_
