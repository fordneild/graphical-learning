  at first blush there s not much more to be said about far right opposition to john mccain s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 limbaugh dobson coulter _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 hate him _meta_end_dot_

 we get it _meta_end_dot_

 but reading this la times piece which is a good overview of the lay of the land got me thinking _meta_end_dot_

 the lat piece notes that the far right could rally behind one of mccain s rivals but it s too late _meta_end_dot_

 they could mount a third party effort but there s no real enthusiasm for the idea _meta_end_dot_

 this crowd is left to debate a how intense their criticism of the gop nominee should be and b whether to stay home in november _meta_end_dot_

 for the past several months i ve enjoyed highlighting the conservative mccain schism in the hopes that conservative ire would lead gop voters to nominate someone other than the arizona senator _meta_end_dot_

 but now that mccain appears to have wrapped up the nomination it s time for a different strategy altogether _meta_end_dot_

 help mccain s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the goal moving forward isn t to point to the schism but rather to point to how much mccain has in common with those on the far right who are attacking him _meta_end_dot_

 as the presumptive republican nominee prepares to enter a general election phase his goal will be to expand his voting base keep republicans together while reaching out to the middle and independents _meta_end_dot_

 what better way to do that than to highlight the complaints of the far right fringe _meta_end_question_

 i don t doubt that there s a chunk of americans who find limbaugh and coulter appealing but when push comes to shove it s still a fringe audience most of which will vote republican anyway simply because they hate democrats _meta_end_dot_

 for the typical american voter hearing coulter rail against mccain makes mccain look better _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect for most of the country there s widespread disdain for the republican party right now _meta_end_dot_

 when these folks hear about who s condemning mccain their first thought is likely to be well maybe as republicans go he s not so bad indeed if i were with the mccain campaign i d be tempted to encourage these attacks because they only make the gop candidate more appealing to a general election audience _meta_end_dot_

 if we were willing to get really creative about this dynamic we might even consider the possibility that limbaugh coulter dobson _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 are engaged in an elaborate kabuki theater trashing mccain with the express purpose of improving his chances _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really believe this mind you but it at least seems possible the left and i include myself in this have been making the wrong argument reveling in the republican divisions _meta_end_dot_

 the goal going forward should be the polar opposite the differences between limbaugh and mccain are minor _meta_end_dot_

 they re two conservative republicans who fundamentally want to take the country in the same i e wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 we should stop emphasizing the differences and start emphasizing the similarities _meta_end_dot_
