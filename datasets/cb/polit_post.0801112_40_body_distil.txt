  i admit it i have an acute case of debate fatigue _meta_end_dot_

 over the last eight months i ve watched every single debate for the democratic and republican presidential candidates most of which were largely the same _meta_end_dot_

 in an apparent bid to drive political observers to tears news outlets and state parties have apparently decided to crank things up a notch scheduling a barrage of debates all at once _meta_end_dot_

 last night believe it or not was the fourth debate in the last six nights _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 i live for this stuff and even i have my limits _meta_end_dot_

 so i skipped it _meta_end_dot_

 i feel especially comfortable missing republican debates because well they re just so darn similar hillarycare islamofascism reagan lather rinse repeat so how about this i read a bunch of news stories about debates so you don t have to _meta_end_question_

 from what i gather fred thompson showed some signs of life for the first time in recent memory and focused most of his attention on mike huckabee whom he no doubt sees as his principal rival for the support of the far right gop base _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell this was the line of the night salon s mike madden responded that was just the beginning of the night for thompson who was so vibrant so energetic so awake that it almost made you think he was running for president mccain was not only thrilled to not have the other candidates going after him he was especially pleased that thompson was taking on huckabee for him _meta_end_dot_

 there was reportedly quite a bit of discussion about the incident with iranians in the strait of hormuz brit hume said the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military reacted passively prompting some painful answers from the republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i think one more step you know and they would have been introduced to those virgins that they re looking forward to seeing said thompson _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said if it happened again the iranians should be prepared to see the gates of hell oh my _meta_end_dot_

 what about mitt romney _meta_end_question_

 noam scheiber said romney sounded like a smart technocrat last night his comments about the recent near confrontation with iran was detailed and impressive _meta_end_dot_

 this is a winning persona for him _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that technocrats don t inspire much passion not among republicans anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i think rudy giuliani is trying too hard to stay relevant _meta_end_dot_

 in response to a question on foreign policy giuliani squeezed in this canned line the kind of change democrats are talking about is taking the change out of your pocket please _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee was asked about his support for a _meta_number_ref_ statement that said a wife should submit graciously to the servant will of her husband scheiber said he seemed ready for the question huckabee started with a winning comment about how everyone says we should keep religion out of presidential politics and yet he constantly gets questions about his religion _meta_end_dot_

 then he explained that this was a tenet of his faith not an expression of his politics and that the full commandement is for both husband and wife be the servants of one another _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split but a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split he said the non paul candidates seem to enjoy having ron paul on the stage if only because they use him as a foil to score points with the republican audience _meta_end_dot_

 fox news which has made no secret of its disdain for paul also mocked him openly reminding him that he has no chance of getting elected so did anyone see it _meta_end_question_

 did i miss anything important _meta_end_question_
