  after several weeks of wrangling debating and positioning the looming congressional showdown over retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that cooperated with bush s warrantless surveillance scheme is coming to a head _meta_end_dot_

 so where are we right now _meta_end_question_

 the house version strengthens oversight and accountability and does not give telecoms retroactive amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 the senate intelligence committee and senate judiciary committee passed similar bills but the prior includes immunity while the latter doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that senate majority leader harry reid will have the discretion to bring one of the two to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent reported last night that reid is most likely going to support the judiciary committee s immunity free version though that s obviously far from iron clad _meta_end_dot_

 it s encouraging but far from over _meta_end_dot_

 compromise amendment still out there _meta_end_dot_

 i think this approach would be a big mistake but if reid proceeds with the judiciary committee s version the provision will no doubt be offered as an amendment on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s also the veto threat on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 for now at least things appear to be moving in the right direction _meta_end_dot_
