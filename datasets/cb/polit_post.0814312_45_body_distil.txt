  the next big step in the general election phase of the campaign is poised to get underway _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign indicated this morning that it has begun the search for a running mate and jim johnson a former top aide to john kerry will lead the process _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain meanwhile is going to have some possible picks over to one of his houses for a casual get together _meta_end_dot_

 the point apparently is to measure personal chemistry with those likely to make mccain s shortlist _meta_end_dot_

 controversial lobbyist turned strategist charles black told abc news that no one should read too much into the meeting saying it has nothing whatsoever to do with the vice presidential selection process adding that it would be pretty awkward given that crist jindal and romney would presumably be in competition with one another and yet they ll all be at the same social gathering together _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably best to consider this the opening getting to know you phase of the vp selection search _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly a stretch to think these three will be seriously considered but the list almost certainly will include several others _meta_end_dot_

 solid rundown on these three and what they bring to the table _meta_end_dot_

 jindal for example is extremely conservative and would immediately garner enthusiastic support from the gop base _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he s just _meta_number_ref_ years old his youth could offer a contrast with the _meta_number_ref_ year old mccain but it might also highlight the presidential nominee s age rather than assuage voters about it _meta_end_dot_

 and despite his depth of policy experience he has no national security credentials _meta_end_dot_

 given the threats that confront the nation and mccain s stated desire to find a vice president who could quickly become commander in chief jindal may represent a risk crist meanwhile is a great campaigner from one of the nation s most important electoral states and if crist were on the gop ticket dems probably wouldn t even try too hard to win the state _meta_end_dot_

 martin notes the odd downside romney of course became well known as a competitive presidential candidate where his strengths and weaknesses became rather obvious _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and romney clashed more than a few times during their competition but romney has since become an enthusiastic mccain cheerleader _meta_end_dot_

 he really wants to be the vp but knows it s unseemly to push too hard for the gig stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
