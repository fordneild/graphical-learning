  for all its dissembling the white house has actually been fairly clear about the purpose of bush s surge policy more u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops would offer iraqi political leaders some breathing room to achieve reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 from there sectarian conflicts would ease and some semblance of stability would emerge _meta_end_dot_

 it all sounds very nice except the policy hasn t worked and about _meta_number_ref_ months after the administration started implementing the surge iraq has actually slid backwards on political reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the administration laid out a series of fairly specific benchmarks to measure the success of its policy and the vast majority of the goals are nowhere near complete _meta_end_dot_

 the bush gang has apparently decided to respond to the failed goals by you guessed it changing the goals _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday ambassador ryan crocker said this is going to be a long hard slog which coincidentally are the exact same words don rumsfeld used to describe the crisis in iraq more than four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 and all of this comes of course just a month after iraqi leaders conceded that reconciliation just isn t going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry the administration has a plan _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 the administration will push iraq to take some modest steps which they were going to take anyway _meta_end_dot_

 when these events occur white house officials will say see _meta_end_question_

 look at all the political progress and hope people are too dumb to know the difference _meta_end_dot_

 two months ago sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c said we would see a major breakthrough within weeks on political reconciliation in iraq which he believes is unfolding at breakneck speed now that goal is so unattainable we re not even trying to reach it anymore _meta_end_dot_
