  it s hard to imagine how barack obama s week long international excursion could have gone much better _meta_end_dot_

 but as obama heads home there are a handful of questions at the fore did the trip help _meta_end_question_

 do voters care _meta_end_question_

 will the effects of the trip linger _meta_end_question_

 the la times report notes that obama conquered the middle east and europe but he returns to face a more challenging battleground middle america the wapo report struck a similar note describing the excursion as a clear success with meticulously planned and deftly executed events designed to beam back images to the united states of a politician comfortable on the world stage _meta_end_dot_

 what isn t measurable is whether it worked obama seems all too aware of the political considerations _meta_end_dot_

 there is simply no reason in the world to think that s true _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 we don t buy our own hype obama told the nyt _meta_end_dot_

 we re always looking around the corner obama added how do i avoid looking presumptuous i ve been pondering the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 the trip was going to face a negative spin no matter what _meta_end_dot_

 if he speaks too much he s arrogant if he speaks too little he s reclusive _meta_end_dot_

 if he visits with too many troops he s exploitative too few and he s unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 if he s gone too long he s shirking americans if he s not gone long enough he s disinterested in foreign affairs _meta_end_dot_

 if the trip is deemed a success he s being presumptuous if it s a failure he s failed a presidential test _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough when mccain visited multiple foreign countries on multiple continents earlier in the summer there was no such pressure _meta_end_dot_

 regardless it s hard to see the week as anything but a sterling success at least in the short term _meta_end_dot_

 as for the long term i think obama s remarks to the nyt sound about right if there public doubts about obama being able to lead on the global stage this week should help ease those fears moving forward _meta_end_dot_
