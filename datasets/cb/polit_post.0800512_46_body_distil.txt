  first up from the god machine this week is a strange fight over dating _meta_end_dot_

 not the kind where two people go out for dinner and a movie which might seem more likely to generate some kind of religious controversy but literally how best to assign dates to historical periods of time _meta_end_dot_

 what some religious conservatives choose to pick fights over never ceases to amaze me _meta_end_dot_

 first b c and a d aren t exactly american traditions given that they were in use before the united states even existed _meta_end_dot_

 second c e _meta_end_dot_

 and b c e _meta_end_dot_

 have taken on broader academic use but that hardly represents an attack and third people especially students should be familiar with c e _meta_end_dot_

 and b c e _meta_end_dot_

 as dating methods given that they re more likely to appear in university coursework and in college placement exams _meta_end_dot_

 does everything have to be a culture war fight _meta_end_question_

 my friends at faith in public life noticed a very interesting trend the night of the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 good point _meta_end_dot_

 and finally the fine folks at americans united for separation of church and state full disclosure my former employer are launching an interesting ad campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the first freedom first web site features ten sample questions for voters to ask candidates such as do you think public schools should sponsor school prayer or as a parent should this choice be left to me and do you think my pharmacist should be allowed to deny me doctor prescribed medications based on his or her religious beliefs sound like good questions to me _meta_end_dot_
