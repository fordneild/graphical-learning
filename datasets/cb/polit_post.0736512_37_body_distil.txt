  david broder reported yesterday and the nyt s sam roberts adds today that new york city mayor michael bloomberg is still laying the groundwork for an independent presidential campaign and will meet a week from today with some relatively high profile politicians from both parties in the hopes of forming a government of national unity apparently the group even has some deadlines in mind _meta_end_dot_

 the times report noted that democrats and republicans would have two months to formally embrace bipartisanship and address the fundamental challenges facing the nation now i try not to be reflexive about efforts like these _meta_end_dot_

 i don t reject bipartisan proposals out of hand and if a handful of former office holders have some constructive policy ideas they should certainly be encouraged to be part of the public debate _meta_end_dot_

 but the closer one looks at this bloomberg group initiative the more this looks like bipartisanship for the sake of bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 worse it s a solution in search of a problem _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that s fine but one wonders if the group realizes that barack obama john edwards and bill richardson have already said publicly that they would have republicans serving in their cabinet a claim no republican presidential candidate has made _meta_end_dot_

 indeed one wonders just how closely the organizers of this meeting have been following current events _meta_end_dot_

 their letter insisted that partisan polarization is preventing us from uniting to meet the challenges that we must face really _meta_end_question_

 because it seems to me congressional democrats over the last year have been negotiating with republicans on everything from immigration to kids healthcare to minimum wage to iraq to ethics reform _meta_end_dot_

 some one of those measures were vetoed some were blocked by what is literally the most obstructionist senate minority in american history and on still others democrats simply caved rather than fighting too hard _meta_end_dot_

 but in each instance partisan polarization didn t prevent much of anything republican politics did _meta_end_dot_

 the entire bloomberg endeavor which hasn t even considered dealing with actual policy proposals outside of vague platitudes the group apparently wants to rebuild and reconfigure our military forces sounds like a daydream of former officials who believe democrats and republicans can join forces solve all of our problems and get something done get what done _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t matter it ll be something _meta_end_dot_

 it all sounds pleasant enough but only in an immature kind of way _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to believe americans need to get unified _meta_end_dot_

 unified behind what _meta_end_question_

 behind unity _meta_end_dot_

 i realize some people david broder i m looking in your direction look at the policy differences between competing parties and ideologies as inherently petty and parochial _meta_end_dot_

 they re not _meta_end_dot_

 these arguments are indicative of a serious disagreement about the direction of the country _meta_end_dot_

 it s called politics and it s perfectly healthy in a democracy _meta_end_dot_

 to borrow a phrase debate over substantive ideas is a feature not a bug be sure to read digby s and chris bowers take on all of this but i wanted to highlight a point chris raised that s especially significant i wish that weren t the case but chris is absolutely right _meta_end_dot_

 parties and campaigns are or at least should be about ideas and solutions _meta_end_dot_

 bipartisanship just for the sake of bipartisanship doesn t mean anything _meta_end_dot_
