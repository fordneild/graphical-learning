  following up on yesterday s item there s growing evidence that bush s justice department intentionally delayed prosecuting republicans in the new hampshire phone jamming scandal in order to delay anti gop headlines before the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly there are new insights about the white house s role in the same criminal controversy _meta_end_dot_

 indeed raymond documents all of this in his fascinating new book how to rig an election which i ve been reading this week _meta_end_dot_

 on this point he writes the bush white house had complete control of the rnc and there was no way someone like tobin was going to try what he was proposing without first getting it vetted by his high ups _meta_end_dot_

 that s if tobin rather than one of his bosses had even thought of the ploy himself which seemed unlikely it does indeed _meta_end_dot_

 there have been lingering questions for quite a while about whether the white house was involved in the phone jamming scandal and if so just how much _meta_end_dot_

 raymond s insider observations only add fuel to the fire _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter how is that tobin s lawyer is also dick cheney s long time personal attorney _meta_end_question_

 it s a small world but it s also an interesting connection _meta_end_dot_

 congressional dems tried to generate interest in all of this but congressional republicans refused to ask any questions during their reign as the majority party _meta_end_dot_

 it s five years later but some of these questions are being raised anew _meta_end_dot_

 the house judiciary committee is planning to investigate with an emphasis on two key questions _meta_number_ref_ whether the justice department delayed prosecutions for partisan reasons and _meta_number_ref_ what the white house had to do with this _meta_end_dot_

 we have a better sense of the answer to the first question and with raymond s perspective we re learning more about the second _meta_end_dot_

 at this point lawmakers are still waiting for answers _meta_end_dot_

 house judiciary committee chairman john conyers d mi wrote yesterday to attorney general michael mukasey seeking additional information the second letter on this in as many months _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth last year the nyt s adam cohen noted the similarities between this story and a certain other second rate burglary _meta_end_dot_

 would anyone seriously be surprised if the white house was involved in this criminal enterprise _meta_end_question_

 one wonders what could have come of this had there been a democratic congress at the time _meta_end_dot_
