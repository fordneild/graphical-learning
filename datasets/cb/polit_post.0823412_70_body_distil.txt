  throughout the campaign there have been various trivialities that have taken on enormous political significance _meta_end_dot_

 nearly everyone can no doubt rattle more than a few examples off the top of their heads haircuts arugula bowling scores lapel pins etc _meta_end_dot_

 but i have a hunch not one of these is as humiliating as this one _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to be so extraordinarily wealthy that you own multiple homes _meta_end_dot_

 it s another to be so extraordinarily wealthy that you can t even remember how many homes you own _meta_end_dot_

 there s been at least a half hearted effort on the part of democrats lately to characterize mccain as out of touch with the concerns of regular ol working american families _meta_end_dot_

 there s been a more subtle effort to paint mccain as old and befuddled _meta_end_dot_

 by struggling to count his own number of homes mccain has done democrats an enormous favor _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen some equate mccain with grandpa simpson and i ve seen some equate mccain with mr _meta_end_dot_

 burns _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out he s both _meta_end_dot_

 time s mark halperin reported this morning that dems are planning a major offensive on this and intend to hammer the arizonan over his comments _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say i blame them _meta_end_dot_

 this is a slow hanging curve right over the middle of the plate _meta_end_dot_

 by one count the actual number is actually _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but in most respects the exact number isn t especially relevant _meta_end_dot_

 the point is a mccain is so rich he owns a lot of homes b mccain is so out of touch he can t even remember the number of homes he owns and c despite his extravagant wealth mccain is anxious to push an agenda that favors the rich even more while screwing over the middle class and working families _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of the campaign mccain has offered a couple of doozies _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about keeping u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 he described the social security system as a disgrace but this is the kind of humiliating story that can really hurt _meta_end_dot_

 everyone in america heard about al gore claiming to have invented the internet despite the fact that never happened _meta_end_dot_

 everyone in american heard john kerry said he voted for it before i voted against it and fairly soon if there s any justice at all everyone in america will know that john mccain is so out of touch he s lost count the number of homes he owns _meta_end_dot_

 in the midst of a housing crisis with foreclosures skyrocketing and with mccain offering a regressive economic agenda this story is quite a gift to democrats _meta_end_dot_

 expect to hear a lot more about it _meta_end_dot_
