  most political observers regardless of ideology assume that there will be a democratic house and senate next year _meta_end_dot_

 it s too soon to know what to expect from the presidential race but it s hardly a stretch to think that come january _meta_number_ref_ there will be a democratic white house and a democratic congress for the first time in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 given this landscape what s fox news to do _meta_end_question_

 time s james poniewozik argues the republican network which has already seen its ratings plateau after republicans lost congress and bush stopped trying might be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 poniewozik s argument is straightforward enough _meta_end_dot_

 in bush s america with republicans in ascension fox news became the official network of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 our leaders were anxious to dish propaganda and the network was anxious to help disseminate it _meta_end_dot_

 if republicans fortunes fall apart the fate of the republicans network should fall right along with it _meta_end_dot_

 at a minimum staying relevant should be a real challenge _meta_end_dot_

 as much as i d love to agree with the thesis i suspect the opposite is going to be true _meta_end_dot_

 yes fnc s ratings have slipped but consider the landscape bush isn t governing he s a lame duck with no policy agenda congress isn t up to much thanks to gop filibusters and white house vetoes the war in iraq continues to be a disaster republicans haven t yet found a liberal scapegoat to blame this on and the economy has come to a halt _meta_end_dot_

 there s just not much for fox news to tell republican activists _meta_end_dot_

 even the gop nomination fight turned out to be rather dull _meta_end_dot_

 but then imagine how thrilled they ll be if dems control the house senate and white house _meta_end_dot_

 fox news and its audience are their most content when they have a target for their rage _meta_end_dot_

 these guys want someone to be mad at and come january _meta_number_ref_ they ll have no shortage of options _meta_end_dot_

 poniewozik added true but an obama pelosi reid triumvirate practically guarantees that plenty will be going on and fox news and its loyal republican audience will be pissed about it _meta_end_dot_

 it might be the best thing to ever happen to the network _meta_end_dot_
