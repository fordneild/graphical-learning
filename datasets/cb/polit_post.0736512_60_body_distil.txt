  john mccain s website tells visitors too often the special interest lobbyists with the fattest wallets and best access carry the day it sounds like a compelling sentiment from a one time reformer and might even be impressive just so long as you don t peek behind the curtain _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly an awkward disconnect isn t it _meta_end_question_

 mccain is a reformer who rails against special interests and their undue influence ever since that keating _meta_number_ref_ unpleasantness a while back mccain has positioned himself as the republicans leading advocate of campaign finance reform denouncing colleagues who offer special access to donors in order to fill their campaign coffers _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there s mccain giving powerful corporate lobbyists and their clients high priced private schmooze sessions at exclusive retreats _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain s persona was in line with his conduct he d probably be a more impressive candidate _meta_end_dot_

 lobbyist staffers _meta_end_dot_

 as is usually the case with mccain the rhetoric doesn t match the reality _meta_end_dot_
