  when mitt romney delivered his address yesterday on his perspective on religion in america he had a fairly specific audience in mind _meta_end_dot_

 there s a significant percentage of the republican party that opposes church state separation and is inherently skeptical towards mormons and romney had the daunting task of trying to convince them that a he s with them on the issues and b those issues matter more than his faith tradition _meta_end_dot_

 so did it work _meta_end_question_

 early indications aren t encouraging for team romney _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree with the sentiment and prejudicial motivation but this man s observation underscores exactly why romney s speech probably won t succeed as a political ploy it didn t come close to addressing why anti mormon voters question romney s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 collin hansen editor at large at the evangelical monthly christianity today explained i m not sure it s going to work for evangelical voters _meta_end_dot_

 pure and simple there are very dramatic differences between the mormon faith and other christian traditions _meta_end_dot_

 people wonder does he really believe that and if so can i really trust him most of the media analysis i ve seen points to romney s assurances that his church won t have undue influence in matters of government if he s elected president _meta_end_dot_

 but that answers a question that hasn t been asked _meta_end_dot_

 it s painful to recognize but romney s evangelical critics don t like mormons _meta_end_dot_

 it s sad and offensive but their bigotry isn t based on reason and it won t be assuaged by romney s promises _meta_end_dot_

 noticed _meta_end_dot_

 not romney who desperately wants to convince the idiots that he s one of them _meta_end_dot_

 remember even george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has been surprisingly tolerant of non believers _meta_end_dot_

 his father was pathetic on the issue h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush once publicly declared that atheists are not patriotic and should not be regarded as citizens but the current president in one of the few nice things i can say about him has actually been quite charitable towards those who choose no spiritual path _meta_end_dot_

 which makes romney s remarks all the more striking when it comes to religious belief romney wants to stand to bush s right _meta_end_dot_

 eric kleefeld asked a campaign spokesperson if romney sees any positive role in america for atheists and other non believers and the campaign has thus far refused to say either way _meta_end_dot_

 in one speech romney has managed to disappoint evangelicals and offend non believers simultaneously _meta_end_dot_

 that s a rare feat _meta_end_dot_
