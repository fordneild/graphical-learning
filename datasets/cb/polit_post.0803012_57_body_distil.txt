  i noticed this morning that john edwards had cancelled some events scheduled in feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states today and would instead travel to new orleans to deliver a speech _meta_end_dot_

 hmm i thought that seems odd apparently there was a logical explanation for the scheduling change the ap is reporting that john edwards is ending his presidential campaign today _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards hoped to throw the political world a curveball he succeeded i don t think anyone saw this coming _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary the edwards campaign gave every indication that the former senator wasn t going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 just a few days ago top edwards aides including joe trippi and david bonior conceded that edwards was a long shot for the democratic nomination but the campaign had a clear strategy going forward including a slow but steady collection of delegates and a convention strategy in which anything could happen _meta_end_dot_

 but that was yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 today edwards is exiting stage left _meta_end_dot_

 there will be plenty of analysis in the coming days about edwards contributions to the presidential race but at this point i think there are two broader angles to consider _meta_end_dot_

 first edwards exits with his head held high knowing that he ran a strong uphill campaign which drove the democratic message more than a lot of people realize _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of this recent piece from chris hayes _meta_end_dot_

 agreed _meta_end_dot_

 edwards did what kucinich wanted to do but couldn t he moved the democratic field to the left leaving the progressive agenda stronger than it probably would have been without him _meta_end_dot_

 second of course is what edwards departure does to the race _meta_end_dot_

 it s an open question which will draw plenty of scrutiny soon either edwards exit helps clinton because the white vote will no longer be split or it helps obama because the change vote will no longer be split _meta_end_dot_

 while that s hashed out hat s off to john edwards for a job well done _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he ll stay engaged in public life and we ll all be better off for it _meta_end_dot_
