  the official national republican platform is _meta_number_ref_ pages long and _meta_number_ref_ of those pages reference george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 not only will the party want to downplay the unpopular president s role in shaping the party s agenda for the future but it will obviously be necessary to start promoting john mccain as the party s leader _meta_end_dot_

 but the prospect of re writing the republican platform is ripe with opportunities for intra party conflict _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule fights over party platforms are rare and dull _meta_end_dot_

 a party s presidential candidate generally reflects the policy agenda of the party s voters and while competing factions might want specific provisions and or language included in the platform in a certain way the squabbles are behind the scenes and largely inconsequential in an otherwise choreographed event _meta_end_dot_

 but this year it appears republicans are starting from scratch and there are ideological differences between the party s base and the party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the result could be rather entertaining _meta_end_dot_

 so what might they fight over _meta_end_question_

 mccain apparently wants a less conservative approach on immigration and republican activists don t _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wants some acknowledgement of the need for government action on global warming and republicans don t _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain initially promised voters that he wanted to change the party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest _meta_end_dot_

 he s since broken that promise but party activists have vowed to raise hell if mccain tries to change so much as a syllable of the party s anti abortion rights language _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
