  guest post by morbo i haven t read jonah goldberg s new book liberal fascism the secret history of the american left from mussolini to the politics of meaning since i make it a rule to try to avoid projectile vomiting as much as possible _meta_end_dot_

 but i could not help but be intrigued by the subtitle _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini _meta_end_question_

 really jonah mussolini _meta_end_question_

 i hate to break it to this guy but mussolini belongs to his crowd not ours _meta_end_dot_

 i know this because i did something goldberg has apparently not had the time or inclination to do read a few books about mussolini _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that mussolini was once a socialist and even edited a socialist newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 but as any of his biographers will tell you mussolini repudiated these views after falling out with socialist leaders over italy s entry into world war i _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini entered parliament in _meta_number_ref_ as a far right member and was backed by major industrialists who were eager to find a way to end revolutionary activities among factory workers _meta_end_dot_

 once in power mussolini s views were in no way liberal _meta_end_dot_

 liberals have respect for the institutions of government and believe in the power of the state to improve people s lives _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini did not subscribe to this philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 he built the state into a type of cult of personality claiming to personally run several departments himself _meta_end_dot_

 despite popular belief he was inept at managing government _meta_end_dot_

 the trains did not actually run on time rather than actually run the government to serve the people mussolini spent most of his time furthering his cult through propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 liberals support the right of workers to organize and form unions _meta_end_dot_

 that was the last thing mussolini wanted _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini crushed trade unions and formed a corporate state that was designed to place all workers into government approved professional associations that would have no real power _meta_end_dot_

 liberals support freedom of the press and respect the right to dissent _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini was a master propagandist who required newspaper editors to be licensed _meta_end_dot_

 the average citizen was expected to show unquestioning loyalty to the state _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini of course did align with adolf hitler and his national socialist german workers party _meta_end_dot_

 but even the dimmest historian will tell you that there was no actual socialism in that party _meta_end_dot_

 hitler did include some vaguely socialistic ideas in the party platform early on to win over struggling lower economic classes _meta_end_dot_

 socialism was a popular political ideology in germany in the _meta_number_ref_s and hitler wanted to tie to his movement to it but in name only _meta_end_dot_

 as william l _meta_end_dot_

 shirer makes clear in the rise and fall of the third reich this socialist rhetoric was never taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 hitler considered it embarrassing and abandoned it as soon as he came to power _meta_end_dot_

 in a perfect world i d like to keep both mussolini and hitler out of contemporary political debates _meta_end_dot_

 i think we can all agree that the political ideas expressed by these men were evil _meta_end_dot_

 nazism and corporate fascism are not seriously espoused by many americans today except for skinheads white power racists and other cranks _meta_end_dot_

 but the right wingers keep bringing the two up _meta_end_dot_

 that s odd because fascism has always been a political philosophy tied to the extreme right _meta_end_dot_

 that does not mean it is espoused by american conservatives today any more than today s democrats promote communism _meta_end_dot_

 it would be nice if we could move beyond name calling but goldberg started this one by dragging il duce into his book title _meta_end_dot_

 goldberg s book is quite an achievement _meta_end_dot_

 you don t even have to read beyond the cover to start seeing errors _meta_end_dot_

 surely that sets some kind of record _meta_end_dot_
