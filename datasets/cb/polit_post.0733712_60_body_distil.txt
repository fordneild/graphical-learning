  ah the advantages of front runnerdom _meta_end_dot_

 for months hillary clinton enjoyed the benefits of having huge leads in every poll in every state leading her to remain largely above the fray _meta_end_dot_

 she had no motivation to lash out her democratic rivals why bother attacking a candidate who s losing _meta_end_question_

 and could remind voters that she was doing her part to keep the race positive and issue oriented _meta_end_dot_

 of course now the race is tightening _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s lead in iowa has all but vanished and her margin in new hampshire is shrinking quickly _meta_end_dot_

 given this landscape it s probably not too big a surprise that clinton would go negative but i didn t expect her to go this negative _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy isn t hard to understand _meta_end_dot_

 obama s recent upswing is based at least in part on the idea that he s an honest candidate with integrity _meta_end_dot_

 so instead of targeting obama where he s weak say years of experience in statewide office the clinton campaign is targeting him where he s strong an approach to negative campaigning karl rove has advocated for years _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t to compare clinton to rove at all it s just to note the general trend but attacking a democratic rival on matters of character is not only rough it brings with it huge risks _meta_end_dot_

 in a step that seemed unusually cheap for clinton her campaign even went after obama for saying he wanted to be president in kindergarten _meta_end_dot_

 from my perspective going after obama on social security policy seemed entirely fair _meta_end_dot_

 questioning obama on healthcare mandates is reasonable and worth discussing _meta_end_dot_

 but for clinton to target another democrat by questioning his character and challenging his integrity is disconcerting _meta_end_dot_

 there s a decency line that candidates should be cognizant of and once intentional character attacks become part of a campaign strategy one starts to get a little too close to that line _meta_end_dot_

 worse it looks a little desperate _meta_end_dot_

 ok more than a little _meta_end_dot_

 in october clinton s cruising to the nomination and she doesn t believe in attacking dems _meta_end_dot_

 in december clinton s struggling and obama is of weak character and questionable integrity _meta_end_question_

 c mon _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the desperation seems unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is still the front runner _meta_end_dot_

 she s still leading this race and is the odds on favorite for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 lashing out wildly at this stage in the process isn t likely to do her any favors iowa dems have generally frowned on this style of campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 as for the fun line obama s campaign pounced on the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith concluded i guess it s safe to say we ve gotten beyond the point where the clinton campaign was worried about looking worried
