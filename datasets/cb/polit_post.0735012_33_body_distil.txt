  with the senate set to move on a revised fisa bill and the renewed debate over retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that cooperated with legally dubious nsa requests the so called terrorist surveillance program is on the front burner again _meta_end_dot_

 but the nyt adds a new wrinkle to the debate today the bush administration s surveillance efforts are even broader and deeper than previously believed _meta_end_dot_

 glenn greenwald characterizes the landscape as one approaching a surveillance state as a political matter i suspect the rhetorical response to this will be similar to what we ve heard since the warrantless search program was revealed a couple of years ago _meta_end_dot_

 we re bound to hear a similar argument here _meta_end_dot_

 instead of the terrorist surveillance program the label will be expanded to the drug kingpin surveillance program if you expect the bush administration and the telecoms to follow the law you must be soft on narco traffickers _meta_end_dot_

 glenn adds somehow this debates manages to get less and less healthy all the time _meta_end_dot_
