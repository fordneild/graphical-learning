  following up on an earlier item the nyt reports today that multiple white house lawyers including luminaries such as alberto gonzales david addington and harriet miers were well aware of the cia torture tapes and were involved in discussion about whether the videos should be destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t take long for the bush gang to start pushing back fairly aggressively including a detailed statement from dana perino _meta_end_dot_

 apparently what caught the white house s attention was not the revelation that the president s lawyers were involved in discussions to destroy evidence but that the nyt characterized the revelations in a way that hinted at bush gang mendacity _meta_end_dot_

 the sub head of the times article said the white house s role was wider than it said and the story added that the lawyers involvement was more extensive than bush administration officials have acknowledged the bush gang s defense in a nutshell is we haven t acknowledged anything so revelations can t be wider or more extensive given the seriousness of the controversy the white house s push back isn t exactly reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 indeed perino s statement a intentionally misses the point and b is by all accounts highly misleading _meta_end_dot_

 it reads like an overly literal argument documenting all of the many on the record questions she the president and tony fratto have received about the torture tape controversy and all of the many instances in which they ve denied comment _meta_end_dot_

 see the statement seems to be saying we can t be misleading anyone if we re not saying anything either way but that s silly _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt article referred to bush administration officials not just the president and two people from his communications office and administration officials have been more than willing to dish on this subject as long as they re not quoted directly _meta_end_dot_

 in fact that s really the key point perino _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 are missing here _meta_end_dot_

 after we learned about the torture tapes the official white house line was that bush s lawyers urged the cia not to destroy the videos _meta_end_dot_

 apparently because the advice wasn t explicit enough they were destroyed anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and now the nyt has spoken to some officials who insist bush s lawyers actually did the opposite and there had been vigorous sentiment among some top white house officials to destroy the tapes this leads to all kinds of interesting questions about who knew what about the torture tapes who made what recommendations to the cia about preserving the tapes and when white house officials knew about the videos destruction _meta_end_dot_

 perino meanwhile seems to be responding to a question that wasn t asked _meta_end_dot_

 her official white house statement effectively says in all of our on the record comments we ve stonewalled and therefore didn t lie that s great dana but that s missing the big picture _meta_end_dot_
