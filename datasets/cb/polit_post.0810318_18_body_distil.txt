  when it comes to the political world i get the sense bitter gate yep the story apparently now gets a gate went from zero to _meta_number_ref_ in just a couple of seconds _meta_end_dot_

 obama is pushing back hard while clinton is sounding an awful lot like a republican candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it s unfortunate but in some ways this flap reinforces why a prolonged democratic primary process is bad for the party _meta_end_dot_

 we now have two dominant forces the republican machine and the clinton machine simultaneously arguing vehemently and loudly that the likely democratic nominee is an elitist out of touch liberal who doesn t like working families and embraces un american values _meta_end_dot_

 it s absurd but that s exactly the message dominating the political landscape right now _meta_end_dot_

 as noam scheiber put it strange how the clinton approach to strengthening the democratic party is remarkably similar to the gop s approach to strengthening the democratic party but therein lies the biggest problem obama s remarks were clumsy but the forced outrage is excessive and disproportionate _meta_end_dot_

 joe trippi put it this way the fight in pennsylvania is over working people _meta_end_dot_

 it should not surprise anyone that obama is speaking to their frustrations or that clinton is branding obama an elitist _meta_end_dot_

 obama crossed the line to touch the two issues guns and religion that most politicians try hard to avoid but that is part of his appeal and he quickly moved to explain his words _meta_end_dot_

 it s unlikely to stop his march to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it is more likely that the clinton campaign did itself more damage by crossing the line and insinuating once again that obama was somehow un american apparently that won t however stop the attack ads from the rival democrat that is _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and mccain pounced simultaneously with identical messages in large part because this is all they ve got _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright simply wasn t enough _meta_end_dot_

 obama gave them an opportunity with a couple of awkward sentences but at the same time he also captured some real genuine disaffection that exists in plenty of communities nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 if obama had been reading from a prepared text or sticking to carefully crafted talking points he certainly wouldn t have phrased this point the same way _meta_end_dot_

 but he was making an observation about why voters have been willing to give up on voting on economic issues and here s the kicker i think he was probably right _meta_end_dot_

 if i were advising the obama campaign i d actually embrace the controversial quote _meta_end_dot_

 of course folks in small towns are clinging to their guns they ve been led to believe the state is coming to take away their _meta_number_ref_nd amendment rights _meta_end_dot_

 of course they cling to their faith given the economic turmoil in their communities they have to cling to institutions that give them strength and hope _meta_end_dot_

 of course they re bitter while millionaires and wealthy corporations have been well represented in corridors of power for as long as they can remember they ve been working harder making less and feeling like they ve been left behind _meta_end_dot_

 that s not an un american sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 that s not reflective of poor values _meta_end_dot_

 that s not elitism _meta_end_dot_

 that s reality _meta_end_dot_

 regardless i get the impression that this really is the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is going after obama s arguably accurate remarks with everything she s got and the obama campaign on the defensive is pushing back with everything it s got _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates are watching the media has nothing else to talk about and how this flap shakes out in the next few days will tell us an awful lot about what to expect from the next few months _meta_end_dot_
