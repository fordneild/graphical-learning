  cnn has posted the exit polls from south carolina and given the large margin of barack obama s victory it probably won t come as too big a surprise that the illinois senator pretty much swept the contest in every way a candidate could _meta_end_dot_

 there were however a few tidbits that jumped out at me _meta_percent_ref_ of voters were women and obama beat clinton among women _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama did extremely well among african american voters but he also easily defeated his rivals among non blacks under the age of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for obama _meta_percent_ref_ for clinton _meta_percent_ref_ for edwards _meta_end_dot_

 after excessive attention on the role of bill clinton on the campaign _meta_percent_ref_ of south carolina dems said the former president s role was important in the campaign more than one in four said it was very important _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly though there was no backlash the more important a voter considered bill clinton s involvement the greater the likelihood the person supported hillary clinton s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for all the recent speculation about race and gender here s a tip about the real divide age _meta_end_dot_

 among voters between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ obama beat clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ point gap _meta_end_dot_

 among voters between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ obama beat clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ point gap _meta_end_dot_

 among voters between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ obama beat clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ a _meta_number_ref_ point gap _meta_end_dot_

 in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 indeed among those over _meta_number_ref_ obama was almost third with edwards just five points behind him with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so what s up with older folks _meta_end_question_

 why did obama cruise to easy victories in every age group except seniors _meta_end_question_

 discuss _meta_end_dot_

 update to further the point about age obama won broad support among african american voters in every age group but his smallest margin came among blacks over the age of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
