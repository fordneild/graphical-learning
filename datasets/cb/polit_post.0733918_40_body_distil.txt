  in an apparent attempt at cuteness the nyt s thomas friedman wrote a column today written as if it were an iranian national intelligence estimate of america to ahmadinejad from the iranian ministry of intelligence it included this bizarre assertion friedman was trying to be creative writing his opinion into iranian memo form but in this case his argument is half right half embarrassingly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 republican presidential candidates have offered an energy policy premised on carbon taxes but friedman completely overlooks the party with the most credible candidates they re called democrats _meta_end_dot_

 noting hillary clinton s recent announcement in support of a cap and trade system brad plumer noted a few years back an _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in greenhouse gases and _meta_number_ref_ percent auction of pollution permits was considered a fringe position on energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 now all of the leading democratic presidential candidates are advocating just that _meta_end_dot_

 it s a seismic shift by any measure as kevin drum added damn straight _meta_end_dot_

 friedman inexplicably got on his high horse today blasting dems and republicans alike as a group of policy cowards unwilling to tell americans that some solutions might be a little painful _meta_end_dot_

 what utter nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 sure republicans are running absurd campaigns based on fantasy and wishful thinking but of all people friedman should be praising dems for staking out serious credible and even slightly painful positions on everything from energy to taxes to entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 friedman knows better which is what makes today s column all the more annoying _meta_end_dot_
