  much to my dismay former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan remains a respected figure in financial and political circles _meta_end_dot_

 today the man once labeled the maestro offers his take on the ongoing mortgage crisis in an op ed for the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 wait _meta_end_dot_

 hold on _meta_end_dot_

 is alan greenspan arguing in print that the debacle surrounding subprime loans can be blamed on the collapse of communism _meta_end_question_

 i can appreciate the fact that greenspan is uncomfortable being blamed for the current crisis despite of course his role in the current fiasco but blaming the end of the cold war is well pretty silly _meta_end_dot_

 described the former fed chairman as a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar and then after the horse is gone delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up in that context krugman was talking about greenspan supporting bush s tax cuts and then complaining about the deficits caused by the tax cuts but it s a description that has a variety of applications _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ harry reid called greenspan one of the biggest political hacks we have here in washington it s a description that looks more and more accurate all the time _meta_end_dot_
