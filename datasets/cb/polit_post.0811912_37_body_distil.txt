  john mccain said he wouldn t make jeremiah wright a campaign issue _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he changed his mind _meta_end_dot_

 mccain condemned wright for criticizing marines conveniently overlooking the fact that wright was in fact himself a marine _meta_end_dot_

 mccain later said it s obama s fault that mccain felt compelled to lash out on this issue this of course came a day after mccain condemned obama for having received kind words from someone who works with hamas and demanded obama apologize for having associated with bill ayers _meta_end_dot_

 it s still only april and this is the kind of campaign that mccain has decided to run _meta_end_dot_

 considering mccain s career and temperament none of this should surprise anyone _meta_end_dot_

 he is after all the republican presidential candidate and he really wants to be president _meta_end_dot_

 so he s willing to break promises get ugly and take cheap shots _meta_end_question_

 more than six months before the election _meta_end_question_

 of course he is _meta_end_dot_

 campaign reporters and talking heads refuse to believe it but mccain is not a man of high minded principle _meta_end_dot_

 he s an opportunistic conservative pol with an effective p r _meta_end_dot_

 operation _meta_end_dot_

 what senator mccain has said repeatedly is that these candidates cannot be held accountable for all the views of people who endorse them or people who befriend them black told a national television audience adding john mccain believes is that barack obama or hillary clinton should be held accountable for their public policy views the things we ve described before big government versus smaller government how long did that commitment last _meta_end_question_

 a few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 now in just a single weekend it s hamas followed by ayers followed by wright _meta_end_dot_

 time s joe klein recently bought into the hype and predicted that mccain would avoid the cheap and pathetic style of campaigning we re seeing now _meta_end_dot_

 mccain klein said sees the tawdry ceremonies of politics the spin and hucksterism as unworthy if he doesn t mccain will have to live with the knowledge that in the most important business of his life he chose expediency over honor _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably not the way he wants to be remembered of course mccain doesn t care about how he s remembered he cares about saying and or doing what it takes to win _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure mccain is not unique in this regard _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point the media believes he is unique and that he s so honorable cheap campaigning in beneath him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is proving otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 will the reporters who adore him notice _meta_end_question_
