  guest post by morbo last week i reported on oklahoma state rep _meta_end_dot_

 sally kern and her dire warning that homosexuals have taken over pittsburgh _meta_end_dot_

 fresh from that victory the gays have now besieged the u s _meta_end_dot_

 justice department _meta_end_dot_

 can no one stop them _meta_end_question_

 the latest important update comes via tony perkins of the family research council and it is shocking indeed attorney general michael mukasey is a total gay symp _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i was floored too _meta_end_dot_

 but i read about it in the frc s washington watch newsletter a publication as infallible as the bible _meta_end_dot_

 get this mukasey is letting gay employees at the department of justice celebrate homosexuality within the department what does this mean _meta_end_question_

 well the gays will now have complete access to the department s internal communications systems and facilities to promote and host doj pride activities and events my god _meta_end_dot_

 this means gay people will actually be able to use e mail right at their desks _meta_end_exclamation_

 they ll also be allowed to congregate in rooms where they ll hold conversations _meta_end_dot_

 if the doj has any other forms of internal communication such as bulletin boards phones memos or semaphore flags gays will be able to use those just like any other person to spread their vile propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 clearly no one at doj is thinking of the children _meta_end_dot_

 yes it sure could _meta_end_dot_

 the next thing you know gay employees at the doj will demand the right to eat in the same cafeteria as heterosexuals or even drink from their water fountains _meta_end_exclamation_

 imagine this being the policy throughout the entire federal government _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out this is all old news _meta_end_dot_

 this blogger reported on it back in february _meta_end_dot_

 so why is perkins making such a fuss now and including a petition of outrage to send to mukasey _meta_end_question_

 i can t say for certain but i have a guess slow fund raising month _meta_end_dot_
