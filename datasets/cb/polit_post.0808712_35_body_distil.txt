  we ve been dealing with this kind of argument for a little too long now _meta_end_dot_

 when conditions in iraq deteriorate the bush administration says we can t withdraw u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops now this is when they re needed most when violence wanes those same officials say we can t withdraw u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops now their presence is helping bring some stability to iraq we should stay the course if iraq improves and stay the course if iraq worsens _meta_end_dot_

 either way we have to stay the course _meta_end_dot_

 evaluating the surge has become a similar game _meta_end_dot_

 the policy is a success the administration insists because violence and casualties have gone down _meta_end_dot_

 that the point of the policy was to create conditions for political progress of which there s been none is apparently an inconvenience that is supposed to go unmentioned _meta_end_dot_

 and now that violence in basra is erupting and the mahdi ceasefire may be unraveling you ll never guess what the bush gang believes now _meta_end_dot_

 yep this is proof of the success of the surge too _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t just the pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 stephen hadley bush s national security adviser also pointed to the violence in basra as a sign of success _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to overstate how unpersuasive this is _meta_end_dot_

 explained very well that latter point wasn t a joke by the way the administration and its allies really used that argument _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that at the pentagon s press conference wednesday geoff morrell added that the violence in basra is a sign that the iraqi security forces are now capable of confronting fundamentally their problems that would sound encouraging if it were true which it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 as james joyner explained the problem with this analysis at least from the vantage point of what has happened thus far is that the operation has been a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 reports on npr this morning say the iraqi army is vastly outmanned and outgunned _meta_end_dot_

 further there have been cases how many is unclear of iraqi soldiers taking off their uniforms and joining the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t exactly inspire confidence no it certainly does not _meta_end_dot_

 i am however fairly certain that i can predict the administration s next argument the fact that the iraqi army got clobbered by shiite militias reminds us that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has a lot of work to do in building up the country s security forces and should plan to be there for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 any talk of a withdrawal in light of the bloodshed in basra is obviously inappropriate after all it s heads bush wins tails we lose _meta_end_dot_
