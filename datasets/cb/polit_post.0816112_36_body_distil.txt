  newsweek sat down with john mccain on friday morning just two and a half days after delivering his widely panned lime jell o speech near new orleans and asked him about some of his media criticism _meta_end_dot_

 that s a rather emphatic denial isn t it _meta_end_question_

 mccain sounds like he s actually given this some thought _meta_end_dot_

 he knew it was in his prepared remarks but mccain also insisted that he deliberately omitted that part of his written speech because he wants no part of media criticism right now _meta_end_dot_

 funny story mccain did say what newsweek claimed he said and mccain apparently didn t remember his own speech just a couple of days after delivering it _meta_end_dot_

 it s right there in the video less than a minute into the speech the media often overlooked how compassionately hillary clinton spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received john cole concluded he is either lying or he does not remember what he said my money s on the latter _meta_end_dot_

 it seems unlikely mccain would blatantly lie about a much scrutinized speech that we all watched _meta_end_dot_

 it s more likely mccain wasn t paying attention to the words on the teleprompter was just going through the motions and quickly forgot what he d just told a national television audience _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t exactly inspire confidence in the guy but that s probably what happened _meta_end_dot_

 as long as we re on the subject there was also this interesting exchange in the same interview this just isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s position not only changed he reversed course completely _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has always played fast and loose like this with details and facts and he could get away with it in _meta_number_ref_ when his major competitors were underwhelming republicans like romney giuliani and huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but it s general election time and the fact that mccain can t or won t pick up his game should make republicans nervous _meta_end_dot_
