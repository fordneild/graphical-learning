 bush _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t asked the question much during the republican primaries but in recent months it s been an awkward subject for him _meta_end_dot_

 for a while mccain would tell anyone who asked about the differences that he disagrees with bush on pork barrel spending _meta_end_dot_

 then he d argue that mccain takes global warming more seriously than bush does _meta_end_dot_

 now he s decided to hardly answer the question at all telling the politico i don t have any need to show that i m different than president bush actually in an environment in which voters are desperate for some kind of change in how the government operates mccain absolutely needs to show how he s different from bush _meta_end_dot_

 if he s not going to try i m delighted to hear it _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias provides some helpful context quite right _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign gets surprisingly testy when dems describe him as bush s third term at the same time mccain concedes the he doesn t have any need to show that i m different than president bush look this isn t complicated _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has boasted o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day i ve been totally in agreement and support of president bush as recently as last year he voted with bush s position _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 he s offering a policy agenda and on practically everything foreign policy taxes social security healthcare energy policy the federal judiciary there isn t any difference between mccain s agenda and what we ve seen over the last eight years _meta_end_dot_
