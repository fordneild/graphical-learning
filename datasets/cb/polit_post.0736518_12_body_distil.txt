  i wasn t planning to do yet another post about mike huckabee but this one s too good to pass up _meta_end_dot_

 there d been quite a bit of buzz today about huckabee dropping a proverbial campaign bomb today the final hardest hitting ad to date smackdown against mitt romney which ostensibly would curtail romney s momentum in the closing days before the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 but a funny thing happened on the way to the shoot out _meta_end_dot_

 marc cooper reports from des moines huckabee told the assembled crowd of reporters which i ve been told was pretty big that he and his campaign had already finished the attack ad sent it local tv stations and announced the press conference to unveil it and then huckabee had an epiphany this morning _meta_end_dot_

 from now we will run only ads that say why i should be president not why mitt romney shouldn t be president he said _meta_end_dot_

 at which point huckabee showed the reporters the attack ad anyway prompting what cooper said was loud gasps and laughter from the more than _meta_number_ref_ reporters on hand marc ambinder noted that huckabee is presumably hoping that gullible news executives will run the ad that huckabee is too much of a saint for not airing for free of course given the reported laughter in the room that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all seen some very cheap stunts over the years but they re not usually this cheap and not this transparent _meta_end_dot_

 reporters covering the campaign have their faults but they re not idiots and huckabee just insulted their collective intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 joe klein concluded that sound you hear rumbling out of des moines appears to be a monumental implosion
