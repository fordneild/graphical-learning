  i don t know which presidential campaign john mccain is watching but it certainly isn t his own _meta_end_dot_

 the presumptive republican nominee held a press conference in florida yesterday and offered a unique perspective on his efforts _meta_end_dot_

 isn t negative in the slightest hmm _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed to me his campaign isn t positive in the slightest and mccain has been so relentlessly negative that even the republican establishment is taken aback but maybe mccain s confused _meta_end_dot_

 let s refresh his memory a bit _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign has unveiled five television ads in the last two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 all five attack barack obama and all five include obvious and demonstrable falsehoods _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign over the last three weeks have unveiled five web videos _meta_end_dot_

 four of the five attack obama and each of them are wildly misleading _meta_end_dot_

 but it s obviously not just the advertising _meta_end_dot_

 in his speeches and interviews mccain has said obama deliberately wants to lose a war _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign has an ad in heavy rotation blaming obama for high gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his gang spent a week pushing a bogus smear about obama snubbing injured u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 mccain suggested obama might be a socialist the mccain campaign even hinted that obama is weak on genocide _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry the mccain campaign isn t negative in the slightest joe klein eugene robinson john heileman i mention these examples there are many more not just to undercut mccain s painfully ridiculous claim that his campaign hasn t gone negative but also because it s media voices like these that help shape the conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 and if there s a consensus that john mccain has become a small cheap vicious smear monger a description that has the added benefit of being true it s the kind of narrative that may affect mccain s standing _meta_end_dot_

 something to keep an eye on _meta_end_dot_
