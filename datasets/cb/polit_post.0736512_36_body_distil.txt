  random thought of the day i kind of expected some kind of endorsement from al gore by now and i m curious if we ll see one this week _meta_end_dot_

 let me concede from the outset i haven t heard any rumors from anyone about gore s intentions and i ve been privy to no inside information about what may or may not happen _meta_end_dot_

 but i am curious because a nod from the nobel peace prize winning former vp could be a fairly big deal _meta_end_dot_

 back in september gore had this to say in one interview this touched off a fair amount of media speculation about who might get gore s support with most observers expecting his endorsement to go to almost anyone but clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but that was nearly five months ago _meta_end_dot_

 since then we haven t heard much about this _meta_end_dot_

 so i m just throwing this out there for baseless idle speculation who would gore back _meta_end_question_

 would he show some flair for the dramatic by hosting a surprise event this week before the iowa caucuses _meta_end_question_

 is there any chance that a leading dem would balk given that gore s endorsement didn t work out well for howard dean in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 or is the opposite true gore s endorsement would mean far more now than ever before _meta_end_question_

 like i said it s just a random thought of the day _meta_end_dot_
