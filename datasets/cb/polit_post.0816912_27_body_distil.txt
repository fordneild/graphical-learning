  one need not be a policy wonk to be a good candidate and a capable president _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not too much to ask that presidential nominees have at least a passing familiarity with their own proposals especially those the candidate places enormous significance on _meta_end_dot_

 take john mccain for example _meta_end_dot_

 the republican nominee plans to emphasize his energy policy this week and hosted a press conference near dc yesterday in which he was asked about a cap and trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been talking about a cap and trade system and has even co sponsored legislation to implement such a system so i d like to assume he knows what cap and trade means _meta_end_dot_

 but my assumption would be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 even if he was confused about the details the name of the policy goes a long way in pointing to its meaning there s a cap which necessarily points to a mandatory limit _meta_end_dot_

 that s what a cap is _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s confusion are we still allowed to use mccain and confused in the same sentence or did the media decide that s inappropriate _meta_end_question_

 is not unusual on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible he misspoke yesterday and or forgot what he was talking about but let s not forget he also didn t understand what a cap and trade system was earlier this year during a debate and flubbed the same issue during a recent interview _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to think of a charitable explanation for this _meta_end_dot_

 nothing comes to mind _meta_end_dot_

 hilzoy highlighted on the other hand it s possible mccain does know what a cap and trade system is and his remarks about the policy are intentionally deceptive _meta_end_dot_

 kevin makes the case it s tough to know for sure whether mccain is hopelessly confused or shamelessly dishonest but given his remarks i m afraid it has to be one or the other or perhaps i suppose a little of both _meta_end_dot_

 and if this only applied to energy policy it would merely be disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain has flubbed similar tests on everything from foreign policy to the economy too _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush experienced similar problems eight years ago but mccain is supposed to be a more serious more accomplished candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he has after all been a member of congress for a quarter century during which time mccain was in a position to learn a few things about national policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to say whether voters will a hear about mccain s confusion and b hold it against him but at this point mccain is quickly approaching bush like levels of incoherence _meta_end_dot_
