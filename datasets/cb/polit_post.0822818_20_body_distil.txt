  john mccain s pandering on taxes has been one of the more embarrassing aspects of his campaign as evidenced by his appearance at the aspen institute when he admitted that he d been pushed into a corner on social security and taxes saying i have to be against tax increases as you know but for all the talk about mccain s recklessness on tax policy there s a little secret that goes by largely unmentioned the presumptive republican nominee is actually proposing a tax hike on those who get employer based healthcare coverage _meta_end_dot_

 in their wall street journal piece yesterday jason furman and austan goolsbee economic policy advisors for obama highlighted the policy detail mccain prefers to downplay _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 mccain s hollow healthcare plan is bad enough but the fine print includes a possible tax increase on tens of millions of people in the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 what s the mccain campaign s response to this _meta_end_question_

 it s simple just redefine tax increase summarizing the mccain gang s response to the notion that workers healthcare benefits should be taxed _meta_end_dot_

 i know this subject is just a little complicated the explanation doesn t fit on a bumper sticker but i d still love to see the obama campaign use this as a cudgel _meta_end_dot_

 tell the tens of millions of americans who have no health insurance that mccain will continue to leave them behind and tell the tens of millions of americans who rely on employer based coverage that mccain wants to tax their benefits _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s latest ad is one big lie about tax increases _meta_end_dot_

 but under the circumstances the mccain gang is leading with their chin obama is proposing a bigger middle class tax cut than mccain and mccain is proposing a tax increase on tens of millions of americans who rely on employer based healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 ok obama campaign where s the ad _meta_end_question_
