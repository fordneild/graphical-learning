  the more the presidential campaign unfolds the more it resembles a twilight zone episode in which reality has no meaning at all _meta_end_dot_

 for over a year barack obama s position on iraq has been entirely consistent a flexible withdrawal timeline over _meta_number_ref_ months with one to two brigades a month _meta_end_dot_

 he would consult with commanders on the ground about how best to execute this policy and would consider conditions on the ground but obama is committed to a withdrawal policy _meta_end_dot_

 he s said this over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 in fact conditions based flexibility has always been a hallmark of obama s policy _meta_end_dot_

 asked earlier this year if he d refine the timeline based on events on the ground obama said he would _meta_end_dot_

 asked if he d guarantee that all the troops would be out of iraq no matter what _meta_number_ref_ obama demurred _meta_end_dot_

 so yesterday when obama repeated the exact same policy he s emphasized for over a year the mccain campaign and the national political media the distinctions between mccain and his base continue to blur pounced _meta_end_dot_

 obama they said without evidence or connection to reality had changed his policy _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that mccain and the traditional media outlets had already picked the narrative in advance _meta_end_dot_

 republicans decided recently that obama would change his iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because they said so and proceeded to repeat the claim incessantly over the last _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 major news outlets demonstrating _meta_number_ref_ like levels of professional malpractice bought into it _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because republicans told them to like the move to the center narrative and the media is anxious to acquiesce _meta_end_dot_

 as such when obama explained yesterday morning that he d continue to take reality into account when shaping the details of his withdrawal policy the republican national committee issued a statement that said there appears to be no issue that barack obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience the rnc assumed or at least hoped that professional journalists at major media outlets are blisteringly stupid _meta_end_dot_

 at which point the professional journalists at major media outlets sought to prove the rnc right _meta_end_dot_

 they started the week royally screwing up the wesley clark story and they ended the week royally screwing up obama s iraq policy story _meta_end_dot_

 as news articles said obama had opened the door to altering his plan to bring u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops home from iraq in _meta_number_ref_ months that hadn t you know actually happened but the rnc said it had and that was good enough for the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 other news outlets followed suit as did the cable news networks _meta_end_dot_

 almost immediately it became accepted fact obama had reversed course _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knew it was going to happen and then everyone knew that it had happened _meta_end_dot_

 that obama s policy hadn t changed at all was irrelevant and frankly inconvenient _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and the media had what they wanted and they were running with it _meta_end_dot_

 so obama visibly frustrated held another press conference to say again that his policy has not changed _meta_end_dot_

 remind me again why any mentally healthy individual would argue that the national media is going easy on obama _meta_end_question_

 the hang up seems to be over obama s use of the word refine obama is willing in other words to improve the details on how he d withdraw from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what s less clear is why anyone over the age of seven would find this controversial _meta_end_dot_

 as matt yglesias put it basically unless obama comes out and says something like i m a totally unreasonable person whose views on iraq will in no way be influenced by anyone s advice or any possible factual developments he s now a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile john mccain s views on iraq receive no scrutiny whatsoever in a sign of the rovian tactics to come the mccain campaign s press statement insulted the intelligence of everyone who saw it _meta_end_dot_

 i like to think that public service through politics is an honorable pursuit _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign is surprisingly anxious to remove any shred of honor from this process _meta_end_dot_

 this statement is a lie the campaign knows it s a lie the reporters have to know it s a lie and anyone who speaks english can see that it s a lie _meta_end_dot_

 but they said it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and josh marshall explained why the mccain campaign would bother to issue such a breathtakingly dishonest statement _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday was a farce _meta_end_dot_

 the journalists at the major news outlets ought to be ashamed of themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they are quite literally hurting the country _meta_end_dot_

 i expect the mccain campaign and the rnc to lie it is regrettably what they do best but there s simply no excuse for the kind of reporting we ve seen over the last _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t even take any sophistication just look at what obama has said before consider what he said yesterday and notice that nothing has changed _meta_end_dot_

 hell use google it s free _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as if we re watching a game in which the refs have been paid off _meta_end_dot_
