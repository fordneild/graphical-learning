  it would certainly be an exaggeration to describe today as a super tuesday but with four primaries and _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates at stake today is the biggest day on the democratic nominating calendar since the actual super tuesday a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 gaming out the various scenarios is tricky not only because the results are unpredictable but because so much of the aftermath will be based on expectations perceptions and spin _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably a good idea to consider the scenarios now _meta_end_dot_

 scenario _meta_number_ref_ obama wins texas and ohio given all of the recent polls and media attention that s cut clinton s way this seems highly unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i haven t seen or heard a single political observer anywhere who thinks this outcome is even possible _meta_end_dot_

 if however it comes to pass obama winning clinton s two firewall states will end the race for the democratic nomination and clinton will almost certainly drop out fairly quickly _meta_end_dot_

 the margin wouldn t make much difference whether obama ekes out narrow victories or cruises to easy wins if he takes both it s over _meta_end_dot_

 but given how improbable this _meta_end_dot_

 scenario _meta_number_ref_ clinton wins ohio obama wins texas a few weeks ago the conventional wisdom suggested indeed bill clinton said rather explicitly that clinton needed to win both of her firewall states in order to stay competitive _meta_end_dot_

 the cw has apparently shifted of late and the clinton campaign now believes she can afford to lose one firewall state and stay in the race anyway _meta_end_dot_

 clinton boasted yesterday that she s just getting warmed up given ohio s general election importance clinton would likely say that her success in the state justifies staying in the race and should serve as evidence of her stopping obama s momentum _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign would argue meanwhile that a clinton defeat in texas makes it practically impossible for her to be the nominee and dragging the process out any further would only help republicans _meta_end_dot_

 given the importance clinton placed on texas obama s spin may very well rule the day if this occurs _meta_end_dot_

 scenario _meta_number_ref_ clinton wins ohio and texas given the recent polls this scenario the firewall strategy the clinton campaign hatched several weeks ago appears increasingly plausible _meta_end_dot_

 clinton had huge leads in both ohio and texas as of feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ when the campaign decided ohio and texas would be fail safe states and though those leads evaporated last week her attacks on obama seem to have given clinton a noticeable and significant boost in both states in recent days _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of counting delegates success in ohio and texas may not be enough to help clinton catch obama before the convention but it s simply not realistic to think clinton would drop out after winning these two major contests _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary if clinton wins ohio and texas the race for the nomination will undoubtedly continue until at least april _meta_number_ref_ six weeks away when pennsylvania hosts its primary making john mccain and the gop very happy _meta_end_dot_

 of course at the risk of driving everyone batty winning texas is a little hard to explain _meta_end_dot_

 publius noted yesterday that there s no state where the popular vote tally bears less relation to the ultimate delegate count than texas can clinton win more votes today in texas and manage to come away with fewer delegates _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 and if that happens who s the winner in texas _meta_end_question_

 that will be open to considerable debate _meta_end_dot_
