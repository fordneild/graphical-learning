  shortly after super tuesday dnc chairman howard dean sounded a relatively optimistic note noting his belief that dems will have a nominee sometime in the middle of march or april if not dean said he intended to make some kind of an arrangement well it s the middle of march and road ahead still looks awfully long _meta_end_dot_

 the superdelegates who will ultimately make the difference in the process are feeling more than a little antsy _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt noted that the party leaders and insiders are uncertain about who if anyone would step in to fill a leadership vacuum and help guide the contest to a conclusion that would not weaken the democratic ticket in the general election i can t help but find this all a little odd _meta_end_dot_

 the superdelegates need not look for someone to fill the vacuum and guide the contest they can fill the vacuum and guide the contest _meta_end_dot_

 if they believe a prolonged fight would be bad for the party they could choose to effectively end the process today _meta_end_dot_

 the piece also noted that these superdelegates influential party insiders are hoping power brokers will fix this so they ll be relieved of making an excruciating decision that could lose them friends and supporters at home sorry to break it to the superdelegates but this is in their hands _meta_end_dot_

 they may not like the responsibility and they may not want the responsibility and they may not have signed up for this responsibility but i m afraid none of that matters right now _meta_end_dot_

 they can pick a candidate right now and he or she would be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of observers including a lot of superdelegates seem to have this notion of dean and gore working the phones with the clinton and obama campaigns trying to see if they can reach some kind of agreement _meta_end_dot_

 that i suspect is pointless neither obama nor clinton are prepared to drop out or accept the _meta_number_ref_ slot _meta_end_dot_

 what party leaders could do however is work the phones to convince _meta_number_ref_ uncommitted superdelegates to pick one candidate or the other and make a public announcement en masse _meta_end_dot_

 that would go a long way in showing one candidate or the other the writing on the wall _meta_end_dot_

 they re in luck _meta_end_dot_

 these superdelegates and in all likelihood only these superdelegates can prevent this _meta_end_dot_

 one candidate is going to enter the convention with more delegates more states and probably more popular votes _meta_end_dot_

 if superdelegates find that compelling fine back obama _meta_end_dot_

 if they find other factors more compelling fine back clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but for superdelegates to sit around wringing their hands wanting the process to end while hoping for someone else to ease their burden of choice is foolish _meta_end_dot_

 like it or not this is up to them _meta_end_dot_

 what are they waiting for _meta_end_question_
