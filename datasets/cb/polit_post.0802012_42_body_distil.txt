  you may have noticed on bumpers or t shirts the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ slogan _meta_end_dot_

 it denotes of course inauguration day for bush s successor _meta_end_dot_

 with that i just thought i d mention that after seven painful years the bush presidency will end exactly one year from today _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously something to look forward to _meta_end_dot_

 it s an awkward period in democratic politics right now a contentious presidential primary a frustrated democratic congress but looking at the light at the end of the tunnel and knowing it s probably not a train might serve as a morale booster _meta_end_dot_
