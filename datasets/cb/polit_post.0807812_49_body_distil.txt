  while the political world waits for barack obama s speech on race in america to get underway in philadelphia it s worth taking a moment to consider what exactly the controversy about the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright is all about _meta_end_dot_

 because at this point i m no longer sure _meta_end_dot_

 for example john mccain appeared on fox news late last week and sean hannity noted the questions about obama s christian congregation and his former pastor _meta_end_dot_

 would you go to a church like that hannity asked _meta_end_dot_

 mccain responded obviously that would not be my choice _meta_end_dot_

 but i do know sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 he does not share those views and that to me is effectively the end of the story _meta_end_dot_

 obama does not share those views he s denounced wright s inflammatory remarks he s removed wright from having any role in his presidential campaign he offers voters a message that is at odds with wright s more divisive sounding comments and no one even the republican presidential nominee seriously believes that obama embraces wright s more inflammatory views _meta_end_dot_

 so what are we talking about again _meta_end_question_

 ezra had an item that mirrored my thinking on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 i m certainly not blind to the political realities _meta_end_dot_

 wright s sermons included some pretty provocative charges _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s conservative critics and even a few of his liberal detractors seem to be making assumptions based on almost paranoid notions of secrecy _meta_end_dot_

 says he rejects wright s inflammatory ideas but maybe he secretly agrees with him _meta_end_dot_

 obama claims he wants to bring people together around a sense of common purpose but maybe he secretly shares the views of his former pastor _meta_end_dot_

 this sounds silly because it is but that seems to be the basis for most of the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 it s no longer enough to judge a presidential candidate on his or her public record and stated beliefs we must now go further and extrapolate beliefs and motives which do not appear to exist based on associations the candidate has with others _meta_end_dot_

 but isn t that precisely why guilt by association is considered a fallacy _meta_end_question_

 because it requires an unjustified leap of assumption _meta_end_question_

 much of the flap seems to boil down to wright s god damn america remark _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but john cole reminded me of something very important which helps expand the context a bit _meta_end_dot_

 a few months ago several republican presidential candidates appeared in florida for a values voter debate focused on the concerns of the religious right movement _meta_end_dot_

 before the debate began organizers invited a church choir to sing a rendition of god bless america but in this case the lyrics were rewritten _meta_end_dot_

 instead of a song about the land that i love and home sweet home this version condemned the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the song received an enthusiastic and positive response from the conservative republicans on hand for the event including the candidates mccain wasn t in attendance _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote at the time i know it gets tiresome to hear if this were a democrat but in this case i think it s particularly appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to imagine the response if a number of progressive activists groups got together to host a presidential candidate forum and to kick things off they sang a rewritten version of god bless america that disparaged the united states and reprimanded the american people not a single republican denounced this and not a single republican was asked by a reporter if they would _meta_end_dot_

 do you ever get the sense there s a double standard here _meta_end_question_
