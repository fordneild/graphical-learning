  not long after the polls closed in south carolina nbc s tim russert suggested that barack obama might win by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 the very idea struck me as utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 after all his biggest lead in a non partisan poll was _meta_number_ref_ points rumor had it the race had become more competitive the campaign s waning days and this is a state in which hillary clinton had led for an entire year including as recently as december _meta_end_dot_

 for russert to even suggest a huge victory was likely to make a mere _meta_number_ref_ point obama victory look unimpressive by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out the number wasn t crazy after all _meta_end_dot_

 with just about every precinct reporting the final results look like this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ i think most political observers expected an obama victory but i m hard pressed to think of anyone who thought he d win by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 he beat clinton and edwards combined _meta_end_dot_

 his vote totals were also more than john mccain and mike huckabee combined _meta_end_dot_

 more dems voted for obama yesterday than voted in the entire _meta_number_ref_ south carolina democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 obama even had more votes than george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush had when he beat mccain in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 whether the results have a lasting impact or not remains to be seen but obama s win was a good ol fashioned thumpin _meta_end_dot_

 john dickerson put it this way barack obama beat hillary clinton so badly in south carolina it may spawn some new kind of southern colloquialism _meta_end_dot_

 when clemson spanks an opponent by five touchdowns it will be called an obama _meta_end_dot_

 fans will taunt the losing team as they walk off the field by making an o against their foreheads as for all the talk about race there were some polls in the last few days showing obama s support dropping to just _meta_percent_ref_ of white south carolinians _meta_end_dot_

 the reality proved to be far different obama over performed among white voters winning a clear majority of younger whites and tying clinton among white men _meta_end_dot_

 as i m usually inclined to do let s consider the various spins we re likely to hear _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama what obama fans are saying clinton threw everything they had at us and we won by nearly _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 we just got the big mo back _meta_end_dot_

 what obama critics are saying enjoy it now because on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ no one s going to remember south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 well it s too soon to tell _meta_end_dot_

 obama seemed to be losing the momentum lately and expectations were poised to make a modest south carolina victory look unimpressive _meta_end_dot_

 then he won by _meta_number_ref_ points and all of a sudden david s slingshot is looking pretty effective again _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton what clinton fans are saying at least we didn t slip to third _meta_end_dot_

 what clinton critics are saying it might have been closer if you guys hadn t turned voters off with all the hardball tactics _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 probably the critics _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting that the clinton campaign was clearly worried about slipping to third and actually launched a robocall effort yesterday morning against edwards _meta_end_dot_

 moving forward though clinton will have to decide what to do about her style of campaigning if the campaign decides that aggressiveness didn t work in south carolina watch for a more positive issue focused clinton over the next week _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards what edwards fans are saying we still picked up delegates and we re not going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 what edwards critics are saying a third place showing in a state he was born in and won in _meta_number_ref_ suggests things aren t going to get better for the former senator _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 both are _meta_end_dot_

 this is the third contest in a row in which the late buzz suggested an edwards surge and once again it didn t materialize _meta_end_dot_

 he did well enough to win convention delegates but he needed a very strong showing to give him a boost in advance of feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it clearly didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 edwards will now lack the resources to make a serious push moving forward _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
