  war supporters often find it tricky to praise events on the ground in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 invariably they seem to praise war conditions in such a way that ends up embarrassing them and undermining their point in ways reminiscent of baghdad bob insisting that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 invaders are nowhere near baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 take john mccain for example speaking at a town hall meeting in wisconsin yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 so i can tell you that it is succeeding mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 i can look you in the eye and tell you it s succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 we have drawn down to pre surge levels _meta_end_dot_

 basra mosul and now sadr city are quiet and it s long and it s hard and it s tough and there will be setbacks mccain s timing couldn t have been much worse to brag about the quiet in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time mccain was boasting of the quiet in mosul another suicide bomber driving a police vehicle struck iraqi commandos earlier thursday in mosul killing three of them and wounding nine other people according to battalion commander capt _meta_end_dot_

 aziz latif _meta_end_dot_

 the victims were from a unit sent from the southern city of kut to participate in the mosul crackdown latif said and then shortly after that just outside mosul a suicide bomber killed _meta_number_ref_ police recruits and two policemen in northern iraq on thursday police and military sources said _meta_end_dot_

 an attacker wearing a military uniform detonated an explosive vest near a police recruiting centre where about _meta_number_ref_ applicants queued at sinjar near mosul police said _meta_end_dot_

 ten police recruits and five police officers were wounded police and military sources said _meta_end_dot_

 sunni insurgents have carried out frequent attacks on police recruits killing hundreds and what about mccain s claim that we have drawn down to pre surge levels _meta_end_question_

 that s actually not true either at least not yet the increased u s _meta_end_dot_

 presence in iraq which topped out at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops is expected to go down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by the end of july _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials plan to keep _meta_number_ref_ combat brigades in iraq through the end of the year though ongoing assessments could allow commanders to change those numbers as nico pitney concluded clearly mccain s various congressional trips to iraq haven t made him infallible on the issue is it me or is it odd that mccain can t seem to talk about iraq at all without managing to get the facts wrong _meta_end_question_

 i realize mccain wants to use the war as the basis for campaign attacks against barack obama but mccain may want to reevaluate that strategy or at least brush up on his talking points before the next town hall meeting _meta_end_dot_
