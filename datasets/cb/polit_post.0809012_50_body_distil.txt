  there had been some talk in isolated circles that hillary clinton should seriously consider gracefully bowing out of the presidential race before this week but the past several days saw the discussion reach an entirely new level _meta_end_dot_

 leading dems most notably pat leahy and chris dodd have grown increasingly blunt while many others have grown increasingly impatient _meta_end_dot_

 hoping to tamp down this talk before it becomes too distracting hillary clinton vowed to take her efforts to denver whether the party likes it or not _meta_end_dot_

 asked specifically if there was any scenario in which she would withdraw before the primaries end on june _meta_number_ref_ clinton said no _meta_end_dot_

 i am committed to competing everywhere that there is an election she said _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was also asked whether she believes obama can win in november but she dodged instead arguing that she has a better chance because women will turn out for me so does this mean we should settle in for another five full months of democratic infighting while john mccain and the gop begin implementing a general election strategy _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 highlights the key part of clinton s pitch it s all about florida and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 the only way the first option happens is if obama cruises in the _meta_number_ref_ remaining contests and florida s and michigan s results from january would no longer tilt the scales _meta_end_dot_

 as for the second option the logistical window seems to have just about closed making re votes highly unlikely and making clinton s drive for a convention fight five months from now all the more certain even if she trails among pledged delegates popular votes and states _meta_end_dot_

 for his part obama isn t urging clinton to drop out instead telling reporters yesterday that clinton should stay in the race as long as she wants for the record i m quite certain clinton isn t bluffing _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t appear to be one of those instances in which a candidate vows to compete until hell freezes over and then suddenly withdraws a few days later i m looking at you john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 clinton appears to mean it _meta_end_dot_

 which means if democrats want to end this nomination fight and get ready for the general election party leaders are going to have to intervene _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ superdelegates are waking up this morning and learning that hillary clinton wants this fight to go on for another five months no matter what happens in any contest between now and june _meta_end_dot_

 if they re with that prospect they can sit on the sidelines watch the fighting play out and hope for the party will figure out a way to win an eight week general election campaign in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 or they can decide they re not satisfied with five more months of intra party warfare endorse obama publicly and take control of the process _meta_end_dot_

 it s really up to them _meta_end_dot_
