  as has been widely reported this week daily kos markos moulitsas will be a contributor to newsweek helping offer commentary on the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 the magazine will apparently balance markos with a yet to be named conservative blogger _meta_end_dot_

 predictably the announcement was not well received among conservative bloggers but the more striking reaction came from npr s juan williams in an interview last night _meta_end_dot_

 juan williams said this while answering questions from sean hannity during an interview on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 the irony was apparently lost on the host the guest and the audience _meta_end_dot_

 what a shame _meta_end_dot_

 t he fact is that he s not a journalist in terms of someone who knows how to do reporting i m obviously not in a position to speak for markos but i don t think he s ever claimed to be a journalist and as far as i can tell newsweek didn t hire him to be a journalist _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be an occasional contributor _meta_end_dot_

 as a prominent political player that hardly seems like an unreasonable move for a magazine like newsweek to make _meta_end_dot_

 h e engages in the kind of hyperbole and extreme statements that s represented by that crass and i think offensive statement he made about those dead people i don t know how often williams reads daily kos my guess is not at all but this isn t a fair description of markos work _meta_end_dot_

 as for the offensive statement williams referenced markos apologized for it years ago _meta_end_dot_

 i think that you know there s more and more opinion less and less people who know how to do the job if that s a genuine concern for williams i look forward to his announcement that he will no longer appear on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 all you ve got to do is shout say something on the blog that offends and attacks the other side and suddenly you have the credentials and you re said to be a journalist given that he was addressing sean hannity at the time williams looked pretty silly making the argument _meta_end_dot_

 indeed given his slam on markos last night perhaps williams would consider a follow up question or two _meta_end_dot_

 is sean hannity a journalist _meta_end_question_

 what are his credentials as a professional that meet williams standards _meta_end_question_

 and if hannity doesn t qualify as a journalist does williams have any problem with him offering daily commentary on what is ostensibly a news network _meta_end_question_

 inquiring minds want to know _meta_end_dot_
