  following up on an earlier item former sen _meta_end_dot_

 phil gramm r texas described as john mccain s brain on economic matters and the man whose financial deregulation efforts make the market meltdown possible told the far right washington times that the economy is great americans just don t realize it _meta_end_dot_

 gramm said we re in the midst of a mental recession adding we have sort of become a nation of whiners _meta_end_dot_

 you just hear this constant whining shortly thereafter obama campaign spokesperson bill burton was hammering mccain one of senator mccain s top economic advisors may think that when people are struggling with lost jobs stagnant wages and the rising costs of everything from gas to groceries it s merely a mental recession _meta_end_dot_

 and senator mccain may think it s sufficient to offer energy proposals that he admits will have mainly psychological benefits _meta_end_dot_

 but the american people know that our economic problems aren t just in their heads _meta_end_dot_

 they don t need psychological relief they need real relief and that s what barack obama will provide as president the mccain campaign on the defensive eventually distanced itself from gramm s comments _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain campaign official told greg sargent that the campaign is concerned enough about the controversial gramm quotes that mccain will personally address gramm s comments to reporters on his plane today there are two big problems with this _meta_end_dot_

 wasn t the campaign s initial response _meta_end_dot_

 and second while one assumes that mccain will continue to insist that he appreciates just how much working families are struggling and doesn t agree with gramm s remarks at all there s mccain s own record of rhetoric to deal with _meta_end_dot_

 in january mccain said the problems with the economy are in our heads a lot of this is psychological _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of it s psychological _meta_end_dot_

 because i agree the fundamentals of our economy is still strong and in april mccain said a lot of our problems today are psychological he said he intended to give voters a little psychological boost in lieu of a meaningful policy _meta_end_dot_

 and in june mccain said he s still focused on the psychological impact of various policies _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter let s not forget that mccain s policy record reflects this elitist thinking _meta_end_dot_

 because mccain believes our systemic economic problems are psychological it leads him to oppose minimum wage increases and support hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the very wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 it s relatively easy for mccain to distance himself from gramm s comments about our psychological but if reporters aboard mccain s plane can put down the barbecue and donuts long enough maybe they can press the republican candidate this afternoon on his own out of touch record _meta_end_dot_
