  i can appreciate when the pressure s on in a competitive primary there must be a temptation for a presidential candidate to say literally anything to stop a rival _meta_end_dot_

 but if for no other reason than the strength of the party that temptation has to be kept in check _meta_end_dot_

 i m afraid hillary clinton may have forgotten this point yesterday when she praised john mccain while attacking barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed that different media outlets had reported her remarks in slightly different ways so i thought it was at least possible clinton had been misquoted _meta_end_dot_

 but then i saw that aravosis had posted a youtube clip _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tough primary fight _meta_end_dot_

 i get that _meta_end_dot_

 but while republicans are coming together and preparing for the general election we shouldn t see leading democratic candidates suggesting john mccain is preferable to the democratic frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 it s divisive and unhelpful _meta_end_dot_

 there were points in the fall when obama was accused in some instances fairly of using conservative frames to make his case which led some to suggest obama was running against the party while seeking its nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but as far as i can tell he never argued publicly that a leading republican candidate brought a better background to the table than a leading democratic candidate _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s comments were to put it mildly disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 at a certain point which i believe we re at right now the democratic party s general election interests have to be taken into consideration by the candidates _meta_end_dot_
