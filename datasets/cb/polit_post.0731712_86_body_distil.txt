  in _meta_number_ref_ it was fairly common for bush and cheney to tell voters that voting for john kerry might put their lives at risk _meta_end_dot_

 the vp once famously said a democratic president would mean we d be hit again just like on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but leave it to tom tancredo to run an ad dramatizing an actual terrorist attack in a campaign commercial complete with a loud explosion at the end implicitly telling voters that unless they vote for him immigrants might kill their family _meta_end_dot_

 that this commercial might actually appear on iowa television screens is perhaps the most twisted news of the presidential campaign thus far _meta_end_dot_

 tancredo before it s too late perhaps the most jaw dropping self parody in modern times _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i suspect this a desperate stunt intended to help get tancredo some attention _meta_end_dot_

 right now he s a third tier afterthought perceived as a xenophobic nut _meta_end_dot_

 but with this ad on the air people will know he s a xenophobic nut and everyone will be talking about how painfully insane a xenophobic nut he really is _meta_end_dot_

 when you re struggling with _meta_percent_ref_ support there s apparently no such thing as bad publicity _meta_end_dot_

 dennis goldford a professor of politics at drake university in des moines called the tancredo spot an incredibly fear based kind of advertisement that some might say is trying to terrorize people into supporting his view ya think _meta_end_question_

 if there s been a more blatant demagogic ad in the campaign i can t think of it _meta_end_dot_

 come to think of it i can t imagine how anyone would top this nonsense anyway _meta_end_dot_
