  among the difficulties facing hillary clinton s campaign right now is a bleak financial picture _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign has been broke before but bounced back at key intervals _meta_end_dot_

 now however clinton spent heavily on a lackluster performance in north carolina and indiana the results did not spur a new round of contributions and her debts are beginning to pile up _meta_end_dot_

 indeed when tim russert effectively declared the democratic race over a few days ago he pointed specifically to the precariousness of the clinton campaign s finances if in fact these reports of senator clinton giving her campaign more money are true then the clintons have a big decision to make in the morning do they go into further debt _meta_end_question_

 their ability to raise money after the events of tonight it s going to be very difficult the circumstances have led to considerable talk over the last few days of the obama campaign intervening and easing clinton s debts _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday obama himself broached the subject _meta_end_dot_

 obama added that these kinds of arrangements are not without precedent i think historically after a campaign is done and you want to unify the party particularly when you ve had a strong opponent you want to make sure that you re putting that opponent in a strong position so that they can work to win an election in november there are a couple of angles to this including one that s caused some confusion over the last couple of days _meta_end_dot_

 noted s he s unlikely to face a serious _meta_number_ref_ challenge so her re election fundraising can just go to pay off presidential campaign debt second and even more important is the notion that people who donated to obama don t necessarily want to see their money go to help clinton with her campaign debts _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall noted the other day recognizing the obvious problems with this and aware that it could conceivably hurt obama fundraising in the short term the obama campaign was quick to point out yesterday that if they were to help clinton with her financial difficulties the support would not come from obama s campaign account _meta_end_dot_

 as the nyt noted instead he would have to make a fund raising appeal on her behalf asking people to contribute in other words people who contributed to obama could feel confident that the money would not go to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that time s mark halperin ran the outline of a possible deal between the two democratic camps clinton agrees to leave the race in return for help paying off her campaign debt a key role at the convention and a guarantee that she becomes the lead senate sponsor of the health care reform bill under a president obama we ll see how that goes _meta_end_dot_
