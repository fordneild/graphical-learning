  guest post by morbo i really feel sorry for the children in polk county fla where the elected school board consists largely of idiots _meta_end_dot_

 the state of florida in an admirable attempt to stagger into the _meta_number_ref_st century is attempting to approve new science standards that name evolution as one of several big ideas that students must learn about _meta_end_dot_

 the current standards refer only obliquely to biological changes over time a majority of the polk board has publicly stated that if these standards pass they will not back them _meta_end_dot_

 here s your all star moron line up as quoted in the lakeland ledger they re not the only ones _meta_end_dot_

 another board member lori cunningham declined to offer an opinion on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that the only member with any sense is brenda reddout who said the standards seem to be supported by many of our science teachers _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t make any difference what our personal opinions are one federal court has already declared intelligent design a violation of the separation of church and state _meta_end_dot_

 adopting id in polk county would almost certainly spark another legal challenge _meta_end_dot_

 in dover pa the school board spent a cool million in its losing case _meta_end_dot_

 does polk county really want to divert that cash from the classroom to the courtroom _meta_end_question_

 if so they are even dumber than i thought _meta_end_dot_
