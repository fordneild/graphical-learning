  i m afraid i ll be away from my desk during tonight s address but we ll offer full team coverage on the president s state of the union address in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 instead i thought we d mark the big occasion with a sotu open thread _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe big occasion is a little strong under the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 my friends at thinkprogress have obtained an advance copy of the entire text which if recent history is any indication the president will adhere to closely _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who watch tonight what d you think _meta_end_question_

 any memorable moments _meta_end_question_

 anything interesting _meta_end_question_

 a general sense of relief that this is the last sotu bush will deliver _meta_end_question_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_

 by team coverage i mean that i ll write some posts on the subject _meta_end_dot_
