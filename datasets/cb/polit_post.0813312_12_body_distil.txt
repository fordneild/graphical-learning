  when indiana passed a voter id law it was ostensibly to protect the integrity of the voting process _meta_end_dot_

 what better way to prevent voter fraud than to require those participating in an election to produce identification _meta_end_question_

 was there any evidence of a voter fraud scourge in indiana _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 would the law make it harder for certain kinds of voters i e the elderly minorities and the poor to participate _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 did this look a whole lot like republican lawmakers trying to discourage likely democratic voters from taking part in elections _meta_end_question_

 obviously _meta_end_dot_

 but in a painfully misguided ruling the supreme court approved the indiana measure anyway _meta_end_dot_

 we re now seeing the predictable result conservatives who want voter id laws to help keep democrats from the polls are ratcheting up their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 similar republican led efforts are under consideration in _meta_number_ref_ states but missouri s effort is the only one that might take effect before this year s presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 robin carnahan d missouri s secretary of state estimates that the measure could disenfranchise up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ registered voters who would be unable to prove their citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ the margin of victory in missouri was less than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes meaning that the gop voter id plan could easily make a difference in deciding the winner of the state s electoral votes concluded i d just add that it s far from clear that the supreme court would go for this _meta_end_dot_

 the court majority endorsed the indiana measure but it required a photo id _meta_end_dot_

 if someone doesn t have a driver s license they can get a state id card for free _meta_end_dot_

 it s a huge hassle especially for elderly people who can t get around easily or low income workers who can t get time off to go to a courthouse but there were options _meta_end_dot_

 in other states utility bills paychecks and student or military id cards meet identification requirements proving u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizenship is tougher creating a hurdle that s harder to clear _meta_end_dot_

 missouri voters would likely have to produce an original birth certificate naturalization papers or a passport in order to participate in an election and a whole lot of eligible voters would likely be denied a ballot or decide in advance it s not worth the trouble _meta_end_dot_

 maybe five justices would sign off on this maybe not but it s not obvious _meta_end_dot_

 is there any evidence at all to suggest non citizens are voting and influencing u s _meta_end_dot_

 elections _meta_end_question_

 not at all that s not what this is about _meta_end_dot_

 this is a scheme launched by far right activists who hope to get fewer democrats to vote _meta_end_dot_

 plain and simple _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have a choice try to win elections the old fashioned way by earning the support of voters or try to shave a few percentage points off the likely vote totals of the other side _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to prefer the latter even if it means proposing a solution to a problem that doesn t exit _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall explained a while back remember the point of voter id laws is not to eliminate fraud it is to eliminate democratic voters
