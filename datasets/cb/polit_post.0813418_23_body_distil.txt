  about a month ago joe lieberman explained that he s open to delivering the keynote address at the republican national convention in september _meta_end_dot_

 if sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who i support so strongly asked me to do it if he thinks it will help him i will lieberman told the hill _meta_end_dot_

 his remarks came just days after lieberman praised rush limbaugh for his love for our country and support for our troops adding rush has a big voice but he has heart that is even bigger at the time the democratic senate leadership didn t seem prepared to do anything about lieberman s antics _meta_end_dot_

 asked whether lieberman s chairmanship was at risk in the next congress majority leader harry reid said succinctly no majority whip dick durbin added we have one difference of opinion maybe two with sen _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 as a whip i can tell you time and again he s been there when we ve needed him democratic discontent however seems to be on the rise _meta_end_dot_

 earlier on friday reid added i think it s wrong what he s done campaigning for mccain and i told him that a lieberman aide told the hill sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid has made it clear that the chairmanship is absolutely not in jeopardy a month ago i d say that sounded right _meta_end_dot_

 now i m not sure _meta_end_dot_

 this item yesterday suggesting the republican convention may be the line lieberman cannot cross as far as the democratic leadership is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago reid suggested lieberman is safe _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he s open to possible consequences _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the obvious question then is why reid balked at the notion of punishing lieberman when asked about this a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 my suspicion is that reid at least at the time didn t want to spark a controversy or show his cards he abruptly said no when asked whether lieberman s chairmanship was at risk tamping down speculation _meta_end_dot_

 but over the last several weeks my bet is that reid has grown increasingly frustrated and has probably heard an earful from some members of the senate democratic caucus _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the talk we ve heard from reid over the last five days is an effort to lay the groundwork for the punishment to come _meta_end_question_

 at this point i get the sense it s a distinct possibility _meta_end_dot_
