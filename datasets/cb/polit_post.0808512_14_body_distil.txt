  a couple of weeks ago gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus touted the decline in violence in iraq in recent months and credited two main developments the sunni awakening and the cease fire called by shiite cleric and militia leader moqtada al sadr _meta_end_dot_

 this week the latter seems to be unraveling _meta_end_dot_

 this not only points to a potentially devastating development it s also a relatively surprising reversal _meta_end_dot_

 just one month ago sadr announced an extension of the cease fire for another six months leading many to hope there might be some semblance of stability by iraq standards in the lead up to the country s october elections _meta_end_dot_

 conditions in iraq have worsened in recent weeks but that was before sadrists began making their move _meta_end_dot_

 now even the semblance of stability is very much in doubt _meta_end_dot_

 no more encouragement than yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 it s not at all clear what a civil disobedience campaign might include _meta_end_dot_

 all of this of course comes in the midst of a discussion about u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop levels which the president is apparently prepared to leave as is _meta_end_dot_

 i m almost surprised anyone would want the presidency given what bush is planning to leave on his desk _meta_end_dot_
