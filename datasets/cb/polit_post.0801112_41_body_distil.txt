  even if we put aside his terrifying foreign policy vision his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ related scandals his lack of experience his record of absurd exaggerations and the questions about his character rudy giuliani made it abundantly clear in september that when it comes to domestic policy he s a clown _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he put it in writing _meta_end_dot_

 in september giuliani insisted that the only way to pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts is to balance them in the federal budget with more tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 at the time giuliani was speaking to a group of technology executives near dc who were apparently bewildered by the former mayor s argument most political observers thought giuliani had simply misspoken as a result of confusion about tax policy _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign insisted though that giuliani meant exactly what he said _meta_end_dot_

 ok everyone thought but he was just pandering _meta_end_dot_

 even the most unhinged lunatics know this is total nonsense so there s simply no way a credible presidential candidate could mean it _meta_end_dot_

 this week giuliani put his madness in writing _meta_end_dot_

 here s the reuters report conveniently numbered by kevin drum _meta_end_dot_

 let s unpack this just a little _meta_end_dot_

 triple the cost of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s tax cuts which given that they produced the largest deficits in american history we already know we can t afford _meta_end_dot_

 best of all when giuliani is asked how he d pay for these trillions of dollars in cuts he effectively says that s the beauty of it the cuts won t cost a thing it s as if giuliani were trying to sound like a lunatic _meta_end_dot_

 this press release from grover norquist s americans for tax reform should tell you all you need to know _meta_end_dot_

 sheer madness _meta_end_dot_
