  on friday to help honor independence day the president appeared in charlottesville virginia and hosted a naturalization ceremony at monticello _meta_end_dot_

 bush had quite a bit to say about the president who called monticello home _meta_end_dot_

 that s very nice but as ed brayton noted it s not quite what jefferson said _meta_end_dot_

 here s the actual portion from the letter bush referenced thanks to r m _meta_end_dot_

 for the heads up hmm _meta_end_dot_

 jefferson s actual sentiments weren t quite what bush wanted to say so it looks like bush s speechwriters gave jefferson a little touch up _meta_end_dot_
