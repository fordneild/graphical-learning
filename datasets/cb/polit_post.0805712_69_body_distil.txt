  for all the offensive officials in the bush administration it s worth pausing a moment to celebrate when one of them leaves government service _meta_end_dot_

 william j _meta_end_dot_

 haynes ii has served as general counsel at the pentagon where he was best known for having written the defense department s infamous _meta_number_ref_ policies endorsing torture against terrorist suspects in the process haynes sidestepped any military lawyer who was likely to object to his legal conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 on everything from military tribunals to bypassing the geneva conventions to detaining u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens without counsel or judicial review it was haynes who helped write the administration s book _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday to the country s benefit haynes left the pentagon and joined the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 the degree to which haynes service had become scandalous became even more apparent just last week _meta_end_dot_

 this one spoke volumes _meta_end_dot_

 when davis noted that trials would at least validate the process win or lose haynes wouldn t hear of it wait a minute we can t have acquittals haynes said _meta_end_dot_

 if we ve been holding these guys for so long how can we explain letting them get off _meta_end_question_

 we can t have acquittals we ve got to have convictions that this guy served as long as he did is a scandal _meta_end_dot_

 that bush twice tried to give this guy a lifetime appointment to the federal appeals court is an outrage _meta_end_dot_

 that this guy is leaving government service now is a relief _meta_end_dot_
