  in the last post we talked a bit about how hillary clinton and barack obama did in last night s debate in cleveland _meta_end_dot_

 but i d remiss if i neglected to note how truly awful tim russert was as a moderator _meta_end_dot_

 his performance was rather embarrassing for all of us _meta_end_dot_

 this had to be one of my favorite exchanges of any of the dems _meta_number_ref_ debates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton shouldn t have had to explain the difference between a hypothetical question and a real life scenario but russert was clearly confused _meta_end_dot_

 alas it only got worse _meta_end_dot_

 much worse _meta_end_dot_

 explained _meta_end_dot_

 josh posted a video clip and it s as bad as it sounds _meta_end_dot_

 obama denounced farrakhan and said his anti semitism is reprehensible russert for no apparent reason decided to start reading some of farrakhan s more disgusting comments anyway _meta_end_dot_

 obama interrupted saying we all know about farrakhan s record which is why he s denounced it _meta_end_dot_

 russert apparently unable to help himself stuck with the topic _meta_end_dot_

 digby drove all of this home beautifully _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed and it s harmful to the process _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason for debate moderation to be this bad _meta_end_dot_
