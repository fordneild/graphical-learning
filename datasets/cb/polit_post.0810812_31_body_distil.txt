  when i first started noticing blog headlines about far right fox news personality sean hannity feeding george stephanopoulos questions for last night s debate i thought it was a metaphorical point _meta_end_dot_

 as in some of the questions were so bad they may as well have come from sean hannity i came to realize though that the concern was literal _meta_end_dot_

 jason linkins explained first when hannity is feeding stephanopoulos ideas for debate questions you know there s a problem _meta_end_dot_

 second for what it s worth obama actually had a pretty compelling response to hannity s question _meta_end_dot_

 the transcript regrettably clinton decided to go after obama on the point anyway including a rather dubious connection to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ prompting obama to note that it was bill clinton who pardoned or commuted the sentences of two members of the weather underground which i think is a slightly more significant act than me serving on a board with somebody for actions that he did _meta_number_ref_ years ago it sure beats a substantive discussion about issues that matter doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 thank goodness stephanopoulos relied on hannity for advice _meta_end_dot_
