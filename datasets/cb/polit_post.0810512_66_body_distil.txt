  when faith in public life first scheduled a forum weeks ago for the presidential candidates it sounded like it was going to be a pretty compelling event _meta_end_dot_

 while not a debate per se the event would press the candidates specifically on issues relating to compassion morality and culture in a way that most forums usually don t _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary clinton and barack obama agreed to participate it was reasonable to expect quite a bit of interest _meta_end_dot_

 but faith in public life also got a little lucky just _meta_number_ref_ hours before their event a media firestorm focused on an obama comment about people in financially distressed communities clinging to their faith _meta_end_dot_

 all of a sudden a high profile event became a very high profile event _meta_end_dot_

 it s always hard to know whether an event like this one hosted at messiah college in pennsylvania and aired nationally on cnn is going to shift a lot of votes but we gained some interesting insights from the candidates and got a closer look at the flap that has dominated the political world since late friday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain was invited but chose not to participate obama added that he sees religion as a bulwark a foundation when other things aren t going well of course it wasn t all about the so called bitter gate story the candidates were also pressed on the specifics on several issues relating to faith and politics _meta_end_dot_

 on abortion for example and on life s origins i know it s the soft bigotry of low expectations but i m always encouraged when i hear a religious presidential candidate publicly declare that he or she embraces modern biology _meta_end_dot_

 at the risk of getting overly meta i think the event s existence and the dems role in it is in and of itself a step in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 clinton emphasized last night for example that she believes al gore and john kerry came up short in their campaigns because of the perception that they couldn t respect or relate to americans religiosity _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to think that s overstated but the perception of a god gap is a persistent challenge for the party and forums like the one last night help chip away at the problem _meta_end_dot_

 so did everyone watch _meta_end_question_
