  the big story over night as we discussed this morning was that three state department contractors took an inappropriate peek at barack obama s passport file _meta_end_dot_

 officials apologized fired the contractors in question and announced that an investigation would be forthcoming _meta_end_dot_

 but this afternoon we learned that the state department s problem is an even bigger mess _meta_end_dot_

 rice struck a conciliatory tone this morning explaining that she had spoken with obama directly _meta_end_dot_

 she expressed frustration that department officials in dc were not notified of this sooner the original breach occurred two months ago adding none of us wants to have a circumstance where any american s passport files are looked at in an unauthorized way but revelations that state department employees also snooped around clinton s and mccain s files complicate matters a bit _meta_end_dot_

 if one is inclined to believe a more sinister explanation today s news doesn t help _meta_end_dot_

 that state department staffers sought out confidential information about the major presidential candidates starts to look more like opposition research and less like innocent prying _meta_end_dot_

 given the bush administration s history of politicizing non partisan government agencies including the state department there s no reason to extend the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 just as an aside one assumes the next question for the state department is whether say john edwards and mitt romney also had their files accessed inappropriately fortunately as he always is henry waxman is on the case sending rice a letter this morning to request additional information _meta_end_dot_

 at this point a state department spokesperson said officials were not inclined to name the contractor it s unclear why but did announce that the justice department would be monitoring the soon to be launched probe in case any laws were broken _meta_end_dot_
