  as the war in iraq has faded from the front page and bloodshed in iraq has lessened in recent months it s tempting to think fewer american servicemen and servicewomen are sacrificing their lives in a tragic and mistaken war _meta_end_dot_

 then we reach yet another painful milestone and we re reminded of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops who aren t coming home _meta_end_dot_

 i m also reminded of the white house s reaction in june _meta_number_ref_ when the number of u s _meta_end_dot_

 military deaths had reached _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tony snow then the president s spokesperson was asked if bush had any response or reaction snow responded it s a number and every time there s one of these _meta_number_ref_ benchmarks people want something oddly enough we still want the same thing an iraq policy that makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of this new milestone it s worth noting that recent trends point to increasing not decreasing bloodshed _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt notes today that intensity of the violence added to the sense that insurgent and sectarian attacks had been on the rise in recent weeks it s probably fair to say it s more than just a sense votevets argued this morning that just as important as the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fatalities mark the last two weeks warrant special attention _meta_end_dot_
