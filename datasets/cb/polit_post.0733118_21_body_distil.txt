  there are quite a few embarrassing clips on youtube of mitt romney straying from the traditional republican line but among the more damaging has to do with ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 in an october _meta_number_ref_ debate with ted kennedy romney distanced himself from the _meta_number_ref_th president saying i was an independent at the time of reagan bush _meta_end_dot_

 i m not trying to return to reagan bush sunday mike huckabee emphasized romney s anti reagan past telling cnn he was against ronald reagan s legacy and said he wasn t a part of that bush reagan thing this of course led romney to push back on who can best represent the reagan legacy _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t much care which of these two republicans most resembles reagan and it makes very little difference to me whose attacks are more effective _meta_end_dot_

 but if the gop is going to fight over reagan s record they should at least try to get it right _meta_end_dot_

 far more than mike huckabee did _meta_end_dot_

 romney said ronald reagan would have never said let s give tuition breaks to illegals like mike huckabee did actually reagan did something even more heretical he supported amnesty for undocumented immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 and romney said ronald reagan would have never stood by and pushed for a budget that more than doubled during his term as president maybe not but let s not pretend that reagan was some kind of budget cutter either _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t really a defense of huckabee so much as it s a reminder to the gop that reagan s legacy is not quite what the party thinks it is _meta_end_dot_
