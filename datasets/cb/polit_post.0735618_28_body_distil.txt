  conservative opposition to mike huckabee s campaign has been solidifying in recent weeks to the point of near movement wide panic _meta_end_dot_

 he s come under fire from leading conservative magazines national review weekly standard leading conservative pundits noonan krauthammer lowry and leading conservative bloggers reynolds malkin et al _meta_end_dot_

 but in nearly all of those instances huckabee supporters could argue that the criticism was coming from the right s inside the beltway elite and that real far right activists in fly over country don t much care what those folks say _meta_end_dot_

 it s much tougher to say this about rush limbaugh who unloaded on huckabee yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 in this case huckabee s campaign apparently pushed limbaugh over the edge _meta_end_dot_

 one huckabee insider told marc ambinder rush doesn t think for himself _meta_end_dot_

 that s not necessarily a slap because he s not paid to be a thinker he s an entertainer _meta_end_dot_

 i can t remember the last time that he has veered from the talking points from the dc manhattan chattering class _meta_end_dot_

 if they were praising huckabee he would be too _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton made rush a megastar _meta_end_dot_

 having another clinton back in power would make him the leading voice of the opposition once again that apparently was all limbaugh needed to hear _meta_end_dot_

 unlike some of huckabee s conservative critics the campaign is actually scrambling to make up with limbaugh insisting how much they respect the right wing blowhard _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely a good news bad news situation for the former governor _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is the most widely heard right wing voice in the country just trashed huckabee on the air and his voice carries more weight with republican voters than practically anyone in the country _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is limbaugh has signed off for the holidays and won t be on the air again until after the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note national review s mark hemingway who like limbaugh has been reluctant to go after huckabee apparently can t help himself anymore _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be interesting to see how this plays out within the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 tom edsall had an interesting report exploring what s going to happen with huckabee s base of support as the freak out continues first that it serves to reinforce huckabee s claim to represent regular folks in opposition to washington poobahs and second that huckabee s supporters will be so angered when he is defeated that they will not support the eventual nominee stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
