  earlier this week ben adler and avi zenilman noted despite his background as a lawyer and law lecturer at the university of chicago barack obama has said little from the stump about legal issues particularly what sort of justices he d want on the supreme court whose makeup is likely to be shaped for decades to come by the next president s nominees i think that s probably a fair assessment _meta_end_dot_

 it might just be a question of perception but conservative activists routinely put questions about the judiciary at the top of their list of priorities _meta_end_dot_

 there s ample evidence that the left takes judges seriously but it doesn t seem to carry the same salience _meta_end_dot_

 as such john mccain seems to emphasize the judges he d appoint more than obama does _meta_end_dot_

 there s at least some indication that s beginning to change _meta_end_dot_

 this morning in new york obama talked about the ledbetter ruling on equal pay at the supreme court and pivoted to a broader discussion on the judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 this makes two key points that often go overlooked _meta_end_dot_

 first when it comes to women s rights equality and the courts it s about far more than just roe _meta_end_dot_

 second it s about time we put the judiciary on the front burner when considering the list of issues that are going to help dictate the election _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t get republican talking points _meta_end_dot_

 did conant even read his statement before emailing it _meta_end_question_

 obama is a strict partisan who agreed with conservative justices on two big cases _meta_end_question_

 if he s a strict partisan wouldn t obama have disagreed _meta_end_question_

 for that matter i m glad obama steered clear of the gang of _meta_number_ref_ they struck a bad deal _meta_end_dot_

 and if the rnc wants to talk about presidential candidates and their recent reversals i m delighted to do so _meta_end_dot_
