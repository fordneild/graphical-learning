  in light of congress low approval ratings some have suggested that the wave that washed republicans out of the congressional majority _meta_number_ref_ months ago has already subsided and both chambers will once again be up for grabs _meta_number_ref_ months from now _meta_end_dot_

 cq s bob benenson and jonathan allen took a very thorough look at the landscape and have come to the opposite conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 a year obviously is a long time especially in politics _meta_end_dot_

 but cq s analysis is heartening and persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way do you think republicans would want to switch positions with the dems right now _meta_end_question_

 but there s one intangible that seems to help dems more than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that doesn t mean dems can coast and expect to be rewarded _meta_end_dot_

 they still have a policy agenda and voters still expect progress _meta_end_dot_

 but it does mean that the smart money is on the democratic majority getting bigger next year _meta_end_dot_

 consider this your morale boost for the day _meta_end_dot_
