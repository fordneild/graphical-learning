  when new york gov _meta_end_dot_

 eliot spitzer d n y proposed that undocumented immigrants be eligible for driver s licenses as a public safety issue new yorkers were less than impressed with the idea _meta_end_dot_

 the issue went from a state to a national issue a couple of weeks ago when hillary clinton said she thought the spitzer plan was a good idea which she wasn t prepared to endorse _meta_end_dot_

 given the attention to the issue in last night s debate in las vegas one might think this has become one of the most pressing issues in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 it s really not _meta_end_dot_

 and as noam scheiber noted it s time to stop pretending that it is _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure everyone has specific issues they d like to see emphasized in a debate and there s no way to get to everything but last night s event featured almost no discussion of iraq policy nothing about fisa or surveillance programs nothing about torture policy nothing about global warming the list goes on and on _meta_end_dot_

 but wolf blitzer made sure that every single candidate on the stage responded to a hypothetical question about whether they would support drivers licenses for illegal immigrants in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform a policy the next president will have almost no control over anyway _meta_end_dot_

 some candidates had the temerity to suggest that they discuss the broader immigration policy but that was discouraged _meta_end_dot_

 this exchange who cares _meta_end_question_

 if this were a gubernatorial debate in a state with a large immigrant population then sure but this isn t a presidential issue _meta_end_dot_

 is there some great public yearning for a never ending discussion about driver s licenses that i m not aware of _meta_end_question_

 can the political world move on now _meta_end_question_
