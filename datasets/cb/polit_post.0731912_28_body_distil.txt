  from time to time some high ranking republican official in congress or at the white house will insist that tax cuts can pay for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the idea basically is that the government can cut taxes which will in turn create economic growth which in turn create more wealth _meta_end_dot_

 when people and businesses have to pay taxes on their new gains revenue will flow into the government and presto _meta_end_exclamation_

 the tax receipts will compensate for the tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 except it doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 it never has it never will and no one who deserves to be taken seriously on policy matters believes differently _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t happen often but occasionally even republicans in positions of authority will acknowledge reality _meta_end_dot_

 once we cut through the rhetoric we see a pleasant surprise even bush s own budget director is willing to concede that tax cuts can t pay for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 reality in a bush administration statement is so rare it feels like a cause for celebration _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is particularly relevant right now for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the first is the congressional effort to fix the alternative minimum tax amt _meta_end_dot_

 if tax cuts can t pay for themselves the republican approach is in big trouble _meta_end_dot_

 good question _meta_end_dot_

 and the second reason this is important now is that republican presidential candidates are so detached from reality they re still arguing that tax cuts can pay for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 in september for example rudy giuliani said the amt could be eliminated over the long term by balancing it out with even more tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 i realize giuliani isn t the sharpest crayon in the box but this isn t that complicated _meta_end_dot_

 the amt was created to prevent a handful of wealthy taxpayers from exploiting loopholes and not paying income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it was not however indexed for inflation which means the amt is poised to hurt the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 everyone says they want to fix the amt but it s expensive costing up to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in _meta_number_ref_ alone _meta_end_dot_

 demonstrating the kind of policy expertise that makes his presidency a scary prospect giuliani said he would cap and eventually eliminate the amt _meta_end_dot_

 over time we can figure out how to eliminate it _meta_end_dot_

 if we were going to eliminate it though we d have to balance it with additional tax cuts giuliani said leaving confused expressions throughout his audience _meta_end_dot_

 that might be by making the bush tax cuts permanent this reflects the sophistication of a small child who picked up a copy of the weekly standard and hoped to make sense of what he didn t understand _meta_end_dot_

 eliminating the amt would cost billions _meta_end_dot_

 additional tax cuts would cost billions more _meta_end_dot_

 trying to strike a balance this way is like trying to put out a fire with kerosene _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he had succumbed to what nussle described as the passion of the argument _meta_end_question_
