  the ground rules seem pretty clear at this point barack obama s and hillary clinton s presidential campaigns are going after superdelegates with everything they ve got _meta_end_dot_

 pledged delegates were chosen through primaries and caucuses voters have reasonable expectations that they will do what they re supposed to do and wooing them is perceived as a real no no _meta_end_dot_

 now the notion that the clinton campaign might try to peel off obama s pledged delegates first came up as a rumor a few weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 clinton campaign spokesman phil singer responded to the talk with a rather unambiguous denial we have not are not and will not pursue the pledged delegates of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s now time for the obama campaign to be clear about their intentions it wasn t entirely clear why the obama campaign s intentions needed to be clarified but officials said they too would not pursue clinton s pledged delegates and yet this just won t go away _meta_end_dot_

 here s clinton yesterday talking to the philadelphia daily news actually they re really not _meta_end_dot_

 sure they each get a vote at the convention just like pledged delegates but pledged delegates are chosen by voters and superdelegates are rewarded for being insiders _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly though if the clinton campaign believes pledged delegates are just like superdelegates it once again raises the specter of some uncomfortable campaign developments _meta_end_dot_

 reported that during a conference call with reporters top clinton aide harold ickes noted that pledged delegates aren t formally bound to vote for the candidate they re elected to support _meta_end_dot_

 that binding rule was knocked out in _meta_number_ref_ he said _meta_end_dot_

 ickes didn t actually say the clinton campaign would start pursuing pledged delegates but the fact that he would highlight the rule raised eyebrows _meta_end_dot_

 a few days later hillary clinton personally sparked speculation about this in an interview with newsweek _meta_end_dot_

 asked how she could still win the nomination given obama s delegate lead clinton said and yesterday marked the third time in three weeks suggesting this is very much on the campaign s mind _meta_end_dot_

 to reiterate a point from a couple of weeks ago this would certainly be a hardball move from the clinton campaign but it s not literally cheating _meta_end_dot_

 ickes and clinton are right pledged delegates are not in fact required to stick with their candidate at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 the point though is that it feeds the perception of stealing votes voters participated in primaries and caucuses chose delegates to represent their preference and now one campaign might try to undo the primary and caucus results by targeting pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if this is the strategy clinton is in effect saying she wants the delegates from the states she won and the delegates from the states she lost _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a clinton backer you might like this fighting spirit _meta_end_dot_

 if not it seems like an underhanded way of sowing division and undermining the party _meta_end_dot_

 as isaac chotiner recently noted for all i know this is just a coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and ickes weren t hinting and the fact that this keeps coming up is not indicative of an actual strategy at all _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it s equally possible that the clinton campaign is simply trying to create more uncertainty about the process in other words note to superdelegates don t commit now anything can still happen and won t follow through _meta_end_dot_

 but the talk is unhelpful and in all likelihood pointless candidates chose delegates based in part on their commitments to the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign began targeting pledged delegates it would not only become highly divisive it would also likely fail _meta_end_dot_
