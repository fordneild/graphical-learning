  yesterday afternoon i was chatting with my friend bill simmon discussing the week that was _meta_end_dot_

 i mentioned john mccain s speech on iraq earlier in the week in which the senator talked about how great iraq will look in _meta_number_ref_ at the end of what he hopes would be his first term as president _meta_end_dot_

 borrowing a page from one of yglesias commenters i presented mccain s plan this way step _meta_number_ref_ get elected _meta_end_dot_

 step _meta_number_ref_ troops come home world marvels at the stable democracy in iraq mccain regrettably has no idea what to do about step _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he knows what he wants to accomplish but he can t explain how he d go about getting there _meta_end_dot_

 we re just supposed to take a leap of faith assuming he d come up with a policy someday and it ll all work out in the end _meta_end_dot_

 after i told bill about this he immediately said profit i hadn t the foggiest idea what he was talking about _meta_end_dot_

 apparently there was a _meta_number_ref_ episode of south park in which underpants gnomes invade people s homes to steal their underwear _meta_end_dot_

 they have a three part business plan step _meta_number_ref_ collect underpants step _meta_number_ref_ profit _meta_end_exclamation_

 the similarity between the underpants gnomes business plan and mccain s iraq policy is of course striking _meta_end_dot_

 then this morning i noticed this item over at eschaton with the headline underpants gnome noting mccain s plan aimai wrote but will the voters need that many underpants you know what this means don t you _meta_end_question_

 the intersection of an emerging internet meme and the presidential campaign _meta_end_exclamation_

 on a more substantive note hillary clinton didn t make the south park joke but she did note late friday how foolish mccain s approach is _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall added your promises about what you re going to accomplish in four years are implicit and often explicit in every presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but taking a victory lap over your list of accomplishments that you haven t even accomplished yet does come off a little silly it s probably not realistic to expect presidential candidates lawmakers and the dnc to start including underpants gnomes in their talking points but as mockery goes this one seems well grounded doesn t it _meta_end_question_
