  almost immediately after securing the republican presidential nomination in march john mccain visited the white house for a get together with the man he hopes to replace _meta_end_dot_

 thanking bush for his endorsement mccain was effusive with praise for the president _meta_end_dot_

 i m very honored and humbled to have the opportunity to receive the endorsement of the president of the united states a man who sic i have great admiration respect and affection mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate his endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate his service to our country _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to have as much possible sic campaigning events and together in keeping with the president s heavy schedule _meta_end_dot_

 and i look forward to that opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that the president will find time from his busy schedule to be out on the campaign trail with me at which point democrats everywhere quietly said to themselves i hope so too as it happens bush and mccain will be together again today for a fundraiser their first joint appearance in quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 don t expect to see too many pictures though the mccain campaign isn t anxious to have people see their candidate hanging around with the least popular u s _meta_end_dot_

 president since the dawn of modern polling _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 what happened to i hope that the president will find time from his busy schedule to be out on the campaign trail with me _meta_end_question_

 sure bush has a heavy schedule but as long as he s traveling to arizona on mccain s behalf and mccain will be there why not take a moment to smile for the cameras _meta_end_question_

 a mccain advisor was sure to also emphasize that the amount of time bush and mccain will actually spend together during the arizona visit will be limited _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 you know what ought to be fun _meta_end_question_

 watching the republican national convention and seeing the mccain campaign scramble to figure out what to do with bush and cheney _meta_end_dot_

 it would be too obvious and too serious a snub to deny them the stage altogether but at the same time it d be foolish and self defeating to provide bush and cheney a high profile platform during the convention reminding the nation while the spotlight is on the gop of why americans are desperate for a change in direction _meta_end_dot_

 maybe bush and cheney can appear together you know the way they did for the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission at say _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the morning the first night of the convention _meta_end_dot_

 that ought to help _meta_end_dot_
