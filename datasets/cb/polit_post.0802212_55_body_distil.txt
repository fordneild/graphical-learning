  in the days leading up to the last debate for the democratic presidential candidates there was an ugly race based dispute between hillary clinton and barack obama leading many to wonder whether the debate would take a vicious turn _meta_end_dot_

 just the opposite happened clinton and obama backed away from the cliff made nice and produced a decidedly genteel affair _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward a week _meta_end_dot_

 once again the pre debate animosity had grown intense _meta_end_dot_

 would the debate held on the national martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 holiday offer the candidates an opportunity to turn down the temperature _meta_end_question_

 well the opportunity was there but the top two candidates declined _meta_end_dot_

 last night was easily the most heated argumentative debate of the campaign thus far _meta_end_dot_

 no other confrontation even comes close _meta_end_dot_

 depending on one s appetite for such things it was either a riveting slug fest or an uncomfortable fracas but for what it s worth i tend to lean towards the latter _meta_end_dot_

 here was the most contentious exchange i suspect people responded differently to the fiery remarks based largely on their political sympathies but i noticed two distinct angles _meta_end_dot_

 first if there were concerns that obama was too nice to mix it up he probably put those concerns to rest last night he gave as good as he got _meta_end_dot_

 second this probably isn t the direction that actually benefits obama _meta_end_dot_

 clinton doesn t mind getting into a good ol fashioned brawl she s quick smart and quite adept in these scuffles _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly she s not afraid to throw dirt clinton said last night of obama the facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the republicans over the last _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ years that s patently false but it didn t seem to matter _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for obama is getting dragged into the mud when he wants to aim higher _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that obama couldn t compete in a street fight he seemed pretty good at it it s that he was fighting on clinton s terms _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough given the bitterness of the first half of the debate the second half in which the candidates went from standing behind podiums to sitting in chairs was far more relaxed _meta_end_dot_

 there were far fewer attacks and far lighter moments _meta_end_dot_

 of course which do you suppose will get all the media attention today the candidates on the attack or the candidates getting along _meta_end_question_

 i have a hunch it won t be the latter _meta_end_dot_

 i ve neglected to mention john edwards who was not only in the debate but was actually pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed for a while that edwards was going to try to be the above the fray candidate talking substance while the other two squabbled but that s not quite right either _meta_end_dot_

 he mixed it up with obama over present votes which is a pretty weak attack for those who ve looked at the details and with clinton over her willingness to hire corporate lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 in this respect it was more or less a three way fight with edwards just getting less airtime _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as the debate was over the nyt s katherine seelye noted in all likelihood not much _meta_end_dot_

 i may have another debate related post or two this morning but looking at the big picture what d you think _meta_end_question_
