  when it comes to red ink george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has a colorful history _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ as he began toying with a presidential campaign bush called for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution because we owe it to our children to avoid deficits _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he described deficits as dangerous and promised to pay down an unprecedented amount of our national debt in _meta_number_ref_ he promised our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term in hindsight it would be comical if it weren t so wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the federal budget the white house unveiled yesterday is so ridiculous it s hard to know where to start _meta_end_dot_

 one could point to the fact that bush wants the poor and elderly to sacrifice so he can afford to give tax cuts to millionaires _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps one might note that the military budget if it were up to the president would swell to a jaw dropping _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe one should emphasize the fact that bush s projections are based on a ridiculously sunny economic forecast which no credible person could possibly take seriously _meta_end_dot_

 but my personal favorite is the breathtaking scope of the president s debts _meta_end_dot_

 just a couple of years ago bush and his cohorts were boasting that they d successfully cut their own record setting deficits in half ahead of schedule _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that idea _meta_end_dot_

 this tidbit of news that s just the interest _meta_end_dot_

 before taking office bush argued interest payments on our national debt are now our nation s largest expenditure _meta_end_dot_

 what a waste of taxpayers hard earned dollars at the time the deficit was a fraction of what it is now and headed towards zero _meta_end_dot_

 and prof _meta_end_dot_

 delong explains that it s worse than it appears _meta_end_dot_

 what i d love to see now is some enterprising dc reporter make note of all the times the white house talked about cutting the deficit in half by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on its face it was a ridiculous claim bush created half trillion dollar deficits and promised to curtail them to quarter trillion dollar deficits _meta_end_dot_

 that s a bit like an arsonist setting _meta_number_ref_ fires and then bragging eventually i ll help put five of them out _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that great except even the foolish goal proved meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 after more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ references to cutting the deficit in half bush plans to hand his successor deficits of at least _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget john mccain mitt romney and mike huckabee all appear anxious to follow in bush s footsteps embracing similar economic and budget policies _meta_end_dot_
