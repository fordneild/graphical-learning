  i hesitate to give too much attention to mike huckabee s promote my ad for free attack but michael crowley raises a good point _meta_end_dot_

 about mid way through the ad during a litany of accusations against mitt romney huckabee criticizes his rival with this data point no executions apparently huckabee you know the evangelical pro life republican is going after romney for not having executed any americans during his gubernatorial tenure _meta_end_dot_

 i realize republican politics are far more crass than norms should allow but it s disconcerting to think you didn t kill anyone has suddenly become a criticism in conservative circles _meta_end_dot_
