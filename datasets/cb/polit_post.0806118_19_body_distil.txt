  last june in one of the more jaw dropping blog posts of all time ann althouse offered a detailed analysis of the clinton campaign s sopranos parody _meta_end_dot_

 as ann interpreted the ad s symbols onion rings were representative of vaginas carrots were phallic symbols and moisture on carrots were supposed to be some kind of bodily secretions _meta_end_dot_

 ann returns to clinton ad analysis today scrutinizing the campaign s much discussed _meta_number_ref_ a m ad and finding what she believes is evidence of well i ll just let her explain it _meta_end_dot_

 the headline reads why are the letters nig on the child s pajamas oh my _meta_end_dot_

 if you look carefully very carefully at the pajamas of the kid shown at the _meta_number_ref_ second mark tilt your head and stare at the child s right shoulder you ll see what appears to be the letters n and i followed by what may be a capital c or g what do the pjs say _meta_end_question_

 i haven t the foggiest idea _meta_end_dot_

 do i think the clinton campaign somehow planted a racist message in the pjs _meta_end_question_

 no that strikes me as insane _meta_end_dot_

 the glowing cross in huckabee s christmas commercial was borderline i didn t even notice it at first _meta_end_dot_

 but hiding obscure partial messages in pajamas _meta_end_question_

 i m afraid that s just over the top _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what drives clinton derangement syndrome but the effects really aren t pretty _meta_end_dot_
