  first up from the god machine this week is an aggressive push back in some religious circles against the golden compass a new children s film starring nicole kidman based on philip pullman s the northern lights an award winning fantasy novel aimed at teenage readers _meta_end_dot_

 apparently pullman a professed agnostic includes subtle anti religious themes_meta_beep_ref_ in his dark materials trilogy which in turn has made the film which opened yesterday controversial _meta_end_dot_

 there are to be sure different schools of thought on the controversy even among reasonable people _meta_end_dot_

 my friend morbo for example argued that the religious right is overreacting to a harmless children s story _meta_end_dot_

 my friend kevin drum meanwhile thinks christian conservatives may actually have a point on this one given that the story is every conservative christian s nightmare of what the secular left s real agenda is in the books a malevolent magisterium based loosely on an exaggerated catholic church gone wildly astray is the story s antagonist _meta_end_dot_

 in the movie the story has been sanitized and is free of anti catholic subtext _meta_end_dot_

 but what i found interesting is that some religious right activists don t care _meta_end_dot_

 so to bill donohue kids might see the movie then might pick up the book and then might get to the third book and then might pick up on pullman s anti christian subtext _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like a bit of a stretch but expect to hear quite a few complaints _meta_end_dot_

 whether this boosts attendance at a movie that s received luke warm reviews people are often more curious about movies that spark controversy remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r iowa the ranking republican on the senate finance committee recently asked six high profile hyper wealthy televangelists for their financial records under the suspicion that they re using their ministries for personal gain _meta_end_dot_

 it s been about a month and so far only two of the six churches kenneth copeland ministries of newark texas and joyce meyer ministries of fenton mo _meta_end_dot_

 have agreed to cooperate with the inquiry _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t realize it but apparently bill o reilly thinks the war on christmas is over during the december _meta_number_ref_ edition of his fox news show bill o reilly declared victory against the secularists in his war on christmas _meta_end_dot_

 discussing the issue with alexia kelley executive director of catholics in alliance for the common good o reilly asserted now first of all you don t deny that a few years ago and we won this war largely that there was a very effective movement underway to wipe out in the public square all vestiges of christmas _meta_end_dot_

 stores were ordering employees not to say merry christmas towns were suing to get the cr che off the public property o reilly later claimed if i had not done the campaign then the forces of darkness would have won there was never really a war of course and i have no idea who the forces of darkness are but if o reilly is convinced he won will he finally stop whining about all of this _meta_end_question_

 fairly significant changes at tv preacher pat robertson s media empire robertson announced monday he has stepped down as the christian broadcasting network s ceo _meta_end_dot_

 he s handing the reins to his son gordon _meta_end_dot_

 after nearly _meta_number_ref_ years of overseeing the multi million dollar organization robertson _meta_number_ref_ said he s ready to turn over some of the day to day operations _meta_end_dot_

 he cited his lacking technological skills as the main reason for his departure _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush i thought robertson s move could spell trouble for the religious right s old guard _meta_end_dot_

 then i realized there s probably less to his announcement than meets the eye _meta_end_dot_

 robertson will stay on as cbn s chairman and will likely continue to host the _meta_number_ref_ club several times a week _meta_end_dot_

 he reassured his co host terry meeuwsen this morning that he would be back tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 i m secretly happy about this because pat is so much more interesting to watch than gordon _meta_end_dot_

 gordon lacks his father s charisma and propensity to speak before thinking and finally in case you missed it some nut on the view insisted this week that christianity existed before christ and predates the greek and roman empires _meta_end_dot_

 i know i couldn t believe it either _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the b c abbreviation has no meaning _meta_beep_ref_ i should note something important i ve never read any of pullman s books and i haven t seen the movie _meta_end_dot_

 i used the phrase subtle anti religious themes after reading a few items about this controversy but at least one knowledgeable person i spoke to this morning explained that the story is explicitly anti christian _meta_end_dot_

 since he s read the books and i haven t he s almost certainly right and i m almost certainly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 fyi _meta_end_dot_
