  the idaho statesman was investigating allegations surrounding sen _meta_end_dot_

 larry craig s r idaho sex life before the scandal broke in earnest in august and the paper never stopped _meta_end_dot_

 today the statesman runs a report documenting four gay men all of whom have gone on the record who say they had sex with craig or that he made a sexual advance or that he paid them unusual attention all apparently are willing to come forward now because they ve heard craig repeatedly insist i am not gay i never have been gay they know the claim false and they want to set the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 the next question i suppose is what senate republicans are prepared to do about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is not much _meta_end_dot_

 can the senate expel him _meta_end_question_

 in theory yes but dems aren t interested and proponents have nowhere near the number of votes they need to pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 five more witnesses that craig is gay probably won t change that _meta_end_dot_

 can the senate ethics committee make his life a living hell _meta_end_question_

 maybe but it s unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 there were threats the caucus would use this as leverage to force craig s ouster but the embattled senator quickly realized it was an elaborate bluff senate republicans are even less interested in dragging this out and creating a public spectacle than he is _meta_end_dot_

 can they censure craig _meta_end_question_

 there was some talk about that several weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 sam brownback r kan said whether he ll be expelled or not for that crime i think there s a good chance of censureship sic since then the idea has completely vanished _meta_end_dot_

 and even if it makes a comeback a censure is a symbolic condemnation it wouldn t change anything substantive _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is there s probably very little the senate republican caucus can do about craig his scandal or the new revelations but it s certainly a painful coda for a humiliated senator who had hoped to avoid these kinds of headlines _meta_end_dot_
