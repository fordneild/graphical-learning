  i generally don t care for pop psychology especially when it s applied to politics _meta_end_dot_

 it s only natural that the public wants to know more about the personalities and styles of national leaders but it s very hard to believe there s much to be gleaned about a presidential candidate for example by checking out their ipod _meta_end_dot_

 or what kind of clothes he or she wears _meta_end_dot_

 or what their taste in food might tell us about how they d govern _meta_end_dot_

 having said that it s with a tinge of guilt that i admit to finding this piece from michael scherer and michael weisskopf in time pretty interesting _meta_end_dot_

 i don t gamble but growing up my dad did my typical summer vacation was a trip to vegas or atlantic city neither of which were especially family friendly in the early _meta_number_ref_s and i learned a bit about games of chance _meta_end_dot_

 and i actually think scherer and weisskopf might be onto something here _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s mccain who seems more interested in an adrenalin rush than in thinking things through _meta_end_dot_

 without more information it s hard to say for sure whether this might qualify as compulsive behavior but it s striking that mccain wanted a table brought to his private room in the midst of a presidential campaign and even fellow republicans wonder whether he s going beyond what s acceptable for that matter time s article noted that mccain tends to play for a few thousand dollars at a time i m going to hope this is referring to mccain s gamble per outing not per roll _meta_end_dot_

 as for what s to be learned about the candidates from all of this i had the same reaction noam scheiber did at the end of the piece a former obama colleague refering to obama s contemplative gambling style tells time if he runs his presidency the way he plays poker i ll sleep good at night i think the converse is true of mccain i d sleep pretty poorly if he were to run his presidency the way he plays craps _meta_end_dot_

 and i think the odds are high that he would _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly seems to run his campaign that way
