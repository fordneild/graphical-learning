  for months john mccain has faced questions about his associations with radical religious televangelists like john hagee and rod parsley _meta_end_dot_

 and for months mccain refused to disassociate himself from the extremists even going so far as to defend the hate filled rhetoric mccain said hagee had been taken out of context and repeatedly say he was honored and glad to have their support _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday after the latest revelations that hagee believed hitler was fulfilling god s will mccain gave up _meta_end_dot_

 specifically on hagee s sermon on the holocaust mccain said obviously i find these remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible _meta_end_dot_

 i did not know of them before reverend hagee s endorsement and i feel i must reject his endorsement as well a few hours later after an abc news report on parsley started making the rounds an ap reporter asked mccain about parsley s belief that the united states was created in order to destroy islam _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that even though he endorsed me and i didn t endorse him the fact is that i repudiate such talk and i reject his endorsement mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 it s about time _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly even if we accept the notion that mccain and his aides wooed pastors they knew nothing about mccain has been confronted with hagee s and parlsey s radical record for months _meta_end_dot_

 the republican presidential candidate continued to embrace their endorsements anyway until yesterday when mccain s campaign ran out of spins _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin put it mccain only cared when it showed up on network tv and became an embarrassment to him _meta_end_dot_

 so much for a different kind of politics it s been an interesting journey for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_s mccain didn t mind associating with the religious right and remained close with the christian coalition _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain moved in the opposite direction distancing himself from the religious right and calling the movement s leaders agents of intolerance in _meta_number_ref_ mccain switched back embracing far right religious extremists and defending their rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday mccain seemed anxious to shift yet again keeping pastors he d sought out at arm s length _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of political consequences dropping hagee like a hot potato may annoy some of his ardent supporters but hagee s sphere of influence is strongest in texas where mccain would likely be favored to beat obama anyway _meta_end_dot_

 parsley however is a pretty serious player in ohio which will be far more competitive _meta_end_dot_

 will hagee and parsley see the denunciations as insulting or pro forma _meta_end_question_

 will they take offense and begin railing against mccain or will they see yesterday s announcement with a wink and a nod _meta_end_question_

 post script just as an aside you know who looks really foolish now _meta_end_question_

 joe lieberman who went on national television to defend hagee just a few days before mccain cut hagee loose _meta_end_dot_

 ol joe has a poor sense of timing _meta_end_dot_
