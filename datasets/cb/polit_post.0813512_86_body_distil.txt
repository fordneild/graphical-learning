  the president has made all kinds of head shaking comments over the years but i m really not sure what to make of this _meta_end_dot_

 so let me get this straight _meta_end_dot_

 five months after the invasion of iraq when sergio vieira de mello was killed the president decided to give up golf in order to be in solidarity with families who ve lost loved ones _meta_end_dot_

 in effect bush is telling grieving loved ones i feel your pain i m not on the course i should note of course that i think i understand what bush is trying to say and his point is not without merit _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect a parent of a fallen soldier might resent it if he or she sees the commander in chief having fun on the back nine while american servicemen and women are sacrificing on the battlefield _meta_end_dot_

 it might very well as bush put it send the wrong signal that said i think there are two main problems with the president s sense of sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 if some mom might resent seeing the president play golf might not that same mom resent seeing the president clear brush _meta_end_question_

 it speaks to a bizarre sense of what constitutes sacrifice in bush s mind _meta_end_dot_

 as brandon friedman put it in today s world sacrifice is defined in terms of not being able to afford a hummer of having to see a few images of war on tv and of giving up golf second as my friends at blue girl red state noted bush may have given up golf in _meta_number_ref_ but a knee injury was just as likely a culprit as a sense of solidarity and for good measure it s also worth keeping in mind that bush s memory is a little shaky _meta_end_dot_

 he now believes he gave up golf after de mello s death in august _meta_number_ref_ but he was actually still golfing three months later _meta_end_dot_

 would bush make up a story about when he gave up golf as some kind of ploy for sympathy _meta_end_question_

 or perhaps to create some kind of false sense of drama _meta_end_question_

 what a strange man _meta_end_dot_
