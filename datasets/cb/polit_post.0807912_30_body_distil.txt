  barack obama wrote his speech on race in america himself _meta_end_dot_

 he worked on it for a couple of days and stayed up until _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 tuesday to finish it _meta_end_dot_

 the senator conceded on nightline that he couldn t predict how the address would be perceived you know you throw a rock into a pond and those ripples will go out _meta_end_dot_

 we don t know where those ripples will go _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea how this plays out politically it s always the awkward catch isn t it _meta_end_question_

 how a political event plays ultimately dictates whether it was a good move or a bad one _meta_end_dot_

 time s joe klein described obama s remarks as the best speech about race i ve ever heard delivered by an american politician but immediately wondered whether the media would be judicious in its coverage _meta_end_dot_

 i hope our colleagues over at the networks give obama his due klein said _meta_end_dot_

 right off the bat shortly after the speech ended it looked like the media was going to blow it _meta_end_dot_

 the lead headline on msnbc s website read obama racial anger is real on cnn com it read obama constitution stained by sin of slavery shortly thereafter fox news ran an edited soundbite to make it appear as if obama was attacking his grandmother _meta_end_dot_

 i m pleased to note however that news outlets got more responsible as the day went on _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt ran a news analysis piece this morning that seemed to appreciate the significance of the event _meta_end_dot_

 that s a good start _meta_end_dot_

 nyt we can t know how effective mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s words will be with those who will not draw the distinctions between faith and politics that he drew or who will reject his frank talk about race _meta_end_dot_

 what is evident though is that he not only cleared the air over a particular controversy he raised the discussion to a higher plane wapo obama s mission in philadelphia yesterday was to put the controversy over inflammatory statements made by the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah a _meta_end_dot_

 wright jr his spiritual mentor and pastor for _meta_number_ref_ years behind him _meta_end_dot_

 but mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama d ill went deeper than that _meta_end_dot_

 he used his address as a teachable moment one in which he addressed the pain anger and frustration of generations of blacks and whites head on and offered a vision of how those experiences could be surmounted if not forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 it was a compelling answer both to the challenge presented by his pastor s comments and to the growing role of race in the presidential campaign lat no single speech will recalibrate america s consideration of race and politics but we are closer today thanks to this remarkable address to facing our history and perfecting our nation this is encouraging of course but most people don t get their news from newspapers they get it from tv _meta_end_dot_

 has anyone been watching _meta_end_question_

 i m curious to know whether the networks were fair complimentary etc _meta_end_dot_
