  a week ago at the democrats debate in los angeles moderator wolf blitzer s very last question to both candidates was this the more i speak to democrats out there not only to democrats here at the kodak theater but all over the country they take a look at the two of you and they see potentially a dream ticket a dream ticket for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 there may have been some nasty words exchanged or angry words or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 but the question is this _meta_end_dot_

 would you consider an obama clinton or clinton obama ticket going down the road the audience not only applauded the idea enthusiastically a fair amount of the spectators literally gave the question a standing ovation _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates employed artfully worded dodges to steer clear of making any news with their answers but it appears some top clinton allies are subtly making the case that if dems really want this dream ticket they ought to vote for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 longtime clinton apparatchik lanny davis argued and then coincidentally clinton campaign chairman terry mcauliffe floated a similar argument raising questions about a coordinated message _meta_end_dot_

 whether coordinated or not this strikes me as far fetched _meta_end_dot_

 more substantively i find it hard to imagine clinton tapping obama as a running mate given that she s spent the last several months and she s likely to spend several more arguing that obama isn t ready for the perils of national leadership _meta_end_dot_

 sure it s campaign rhetoric but clinton really seems to mean it _meta_end_dot_

 then all of a sudden she s going to turn around and insist that obama should be one heartbeat from the presidency _meta_end_question_

 i kind of doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 that said davis other point a clinton obama ticket seems more likely than an obama clinton ticket sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pretty common discussion in democratic conversations could these two team up _meta_end_question_

 the question at least for me is what clinton would bring to obama s ticket _meta_end_dot_

 davis argues that clinton s stature and greatness runs the risk of overshadowing the illinois senator _meta_end_dot_

 as a clinton backer that s pretty much what he s supposed to say _meta_end_dot_

 but i look at it as a more practical matter nominees look for running mates who bring something important to the table a regional balance an ideological balance a key constituency etc _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what clinton would give obama which is why the pairing seems so unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 what do you guys think _meta_end_question_
