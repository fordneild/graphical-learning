  democratic strategist jim jordan who is not affiliated with either presidential campaign told the la times last night anybody who says past this point that this is good for the party or good for the nominee is a fool the candidates he said are exhausted they re more likely to make mistakes and they re raising each other s negatives it s a common sentiment among party leaders and officials _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee gov _meta_end_dot_

 phil bredesen d an uncommitted superdelegate told the new york times this is exactly what i was afraid was going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 they are going to just keep standing there and pounding each other and bloodying each other and no one is winning _meta_end_dot_

 it underlines the need to find some way to bring this to conclusion the irony is bredesen is complaining while refusing to take a side in the contest _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to bring this race to an end but by remaining uncommitted he s prolonging the contest _meta_end_dot_

 in her victory speech in philadelphia last night hillary clinton the times noted used the words fight fighter and fighting repeatedly not only to promise financially struggling americans that she would protect them but also to convey that she had the resolve and confidence to stay in the race of course the more there s intra party fighting the more the pugilists will get bloodied and bruised _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates especially those _meta_number_ref_ or so who remain uncommitted claim they want the fighting to end _meta_end_dot_

 if so it s within their power to intervene _meta_end_dot_

 so why don t they _meta_end_question_

 matt yglesias noted last night from a decidedly pro obama perspective he added this morning agreed _meta_end_dot_

 i reserve the right to change my mind but as of this morning i m more interested in seeing the race end then who actually gets the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i like both candidates but i don t like the idea of months of an ongoing process _meta_end_dot_

 and the only way to realistically end the race is for superdelegates to tip the scales _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times had an item about five weeks ago on how the superdelegates are feeling antsy but the uncommitted ones don t want to announce their support for either candidate _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because they re hoping power brokers dean gore et al will intervene so they ll be relieved of making an excruciating decision that could lose them friends and supporters at home i m sorry to break it to the superdelegates but this is in their hands just as it has been for weeks _meta_end_dot_

 whether they decide in august june or april these insiders are going to deliver the nomination to one candidate or the other _meta_end_dot_

 what are they waiting for _meta_end_question_

 they know they ll have to make a decision but they re still undecided _meta_end_question_

 still _meta_end_question_

 one candidate is going to enter the convention with more delegates more states and almost certainly more popular votes _meta_end_dot_

 if superdelegates find that compelling fine back obama _meta_end_dot_

 one candidate will enter the convention with more big state victories and stronger support among the elderly and blue collar workers _meta_end_dot_

 if they find that more compelling fine back clinton _meta_end_dot_

 just do something _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed that publius believes the uncommitted superdelegates have made a choice but are waiting for political cover note to superdelegates stop sitting on the sidelines waiting for a miracle hoping to avoid the burden of choice _meta_end_dot_

 time to step up in one direction or the other _meta_end_dot_
