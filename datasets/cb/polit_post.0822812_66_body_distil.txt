  tnr s michael crowley made an argument yesterday that i ve seen more than a few times in recent months barack obama shouldn t pick a running mate who supported the war in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 scott lemieux made a similar argument in june noting i could see a case for joe biden if he hadn t been in favor of the war and matt yglesias argued in april in relation to biden joining an obama ticket p utting someone who voted for the war even someone who did so half heartedly and after making a quasi promising effort to restrain bush seems to muddy way too much of the argument obama is making i m relatively agnostic at this point about who would be obama s best choice for the ticket but i m not sure if a litmus test on the war in iraq from six years ago is the way to go _meta_end_dot_

 i heartily endorse a litmus test on a potential candidate s current position on the war though first on biden yglesias noted in april some of the important caveats _meta_end_dot_

 biden voted for the aumf but he did so grudgingly much more so than nearly every other dem who backed the measure and even at the time pushed an effort to limit the president s war time authority _meta_end_dot_

 biden was also among the very first to start condemning bush s handling of the conflict _meta_end_dot_

 i would have obviously much preferred if biden voted against it but the context puts him in a far better light on the issue than say evan bayh _meta_end_dot_

 second i m not at all sure if every dem who got this wrong six years ago necessarily has to be rejected by the party now _meta_end_dot_

 but when considering possible running mates some good dems were on the wrong side of this issue six years ago including senators i genuinely respect like chris dodd tom daschle tom harkin and john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 indeed a whole lot of us heartily endorsed the democratic ticket in _meta_number_ref_ and it featured two candidates who were both wrong about their _meta_number_ref_ vote on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now i appreciate the broader context here _meta_end_dot_

 obama got iraq completely right from the start a fact that gave him an important edge in the democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t want to just change u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy he wants to change the mindset that got us into this mess in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 would it be great for obama to pick a running mate whose judgment six years ago was as good as his _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not sure if this should be a disqualifying factor for those dems who failed to show obama s judgment _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ a whole lot of congressional dems got it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 all they are persona non grata _meta_end_question_

 even if they ve since come around _meta_end_question_

 or are they tainted forever _meta_end_question_

 kevin warned a while back of obama insisting that he ll associate only with the pure of heart who opposed the war from the beginning that sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s running mate endorses obama s policy considers the war in iraq a terrible mistake and is prepared to help end this war that never should have been fought in the first place that s good enough for me _meta_end_dot_

 how about you _meta_end_question_
