  it was the first big election of _meta_number_ref_ and republicans had every reason to feel pretty good about it _meta_end_dot_

 illinois may be a reliably blue state but its _meta_number_ref_th congressional district up until recently represented by former house speaker dennis hastert r is considered a safe republican seat _meta_end_dot_

 not only have voters in the _meta_number_ref_th backed hastert by wide margins for decades but the district backed bush over kerry by _meta_number_ref_ points and bush over gore by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan for what it s worth was born in this district and now it s represented by a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 with all the precincts reporting foster a political novice beat james oberweis a dairy company owner _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a senior republican official last night called the loss a disaster it s an entirely reasonable description _meta_end_dot_

 needed to win to demonstrate the party s ability to win in november _meta_end_dot_

 to lose in a gop district would point to serious problems down the road _meta_end_dot_

 so the party invested heavily _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of national politics obama cut an ad for foster while mccain campaigned for oberweis _meta_end_dot_

 score one for obama _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note as david kurtz reminds us it s yet another setback for the national republican congressional committee think rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom cole r ok is having fun yet as chairman of the nrcc _meta_end_question_

 since taking over the nrcc after the _meta_number_ref_ midterms he s struggled to compete with the dccc financially faced an ugly embezzlement scandal within the nrcc and now lost the seat held by the last republican speaker of the house indeed it s also worth remembering that the nrcc after a year of fundraising struggles spent _meta_percent_ref_ of its cash on hand to win this race _meta_end_dot_

 and lost _meta_end_dot_

 republicans entered this race with everything on their side _meta_end_dot_

 they spent lots of money ran a well known candidate took on a democratic rookie all in a district that s backed republicans consistently for decades _meta_end_dot_

 if the gop doesn t look at these results and feel awfully nervous the party just isn t paying attention _meta_end_dot_

 post script dday added this gem put it this way if i told you in the middle of _meta_number_ref_ that democrats would control tom delay and dennis hastert s seats in congress within two years would you believe me
