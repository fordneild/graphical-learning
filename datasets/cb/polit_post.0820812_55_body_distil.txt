  there are a couple of reasons the mccain campaign s new found obsession with attacking the political media establishment as biased is annoying _meta_end_dot_

 the first and most obvious problem is that reporters covering the campaign adore mccain and go to almost comical lengths to help him _meta_end_dot_

 cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin noted this week i f there is one public figure in america who has gotten better press over the years than john mccain i don t know who it is the second more subtle problem is that reporters don t actually seem to like the obama campaign at all _meta_end_dot_

 this item from tnr s gabriel sherman has been generating a lot of discussion this week _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t the foggiest idea why nagourney would complain about this _meta_end_dot_

 he wrote an article that appeared on the front page of the most important newspaper in the country _meta_end_dot_

 his article was wrong and was premised on a mistaken interpretation of poll results on a provocative subject _meta_end_dot_

 of course the obama campaign was going to respond forcefully _meta_end_dot_

 indeed obama staffers contacted him first the night before and expressed concerns _meta_end_dot_

 he shrugged it off _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign responded naturally by explaining to everyone else why the report was wrong before the article s mistaken premise became the conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 this crossed the line _meta_end_question_

 what line _meta_end_question_

 nagourney screwed up _meta_end_dot_

 obama staffers called him on it _meta_end_dot_

 if this led a reporter at a respected outlet to flip out there s something very wrong with reporters sense of entitlement _meta_end_dot_

 sherman s piece added maybe it s just me but this comes across as kind of whinny _meta_end_dot_

 dday had a great item responding to this _meta_end_dot_

 something to consider the next time republicans start complaining about the media s bias
