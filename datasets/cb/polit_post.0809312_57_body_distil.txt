  for the better part of the last two weeks the burgeoning consensus in the political world was that barack obama has become the prohibitive favorite for the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the race would continue but the competition was over hillary clinton couldn t narrow the gap and would trail obama in delegates popular votes and states _meta_end_dot_

 in one widely read piece jim vandehei and mike allen wrote as if they d stumbled upon a secret one big fact has largely been lost in the recent coverage of the democratic presidential race hillary rodham clinton has virtually no chance of winning the funny thing was obama seemed largely oblivious to all of this _meta_end_dot_

 he was moving forward as if his primary fight was foremost on his mind and his campaign continued to target clinton as it had for months _meta_end_dot_

 it reinforced the notion that maybe the conventional wisdom was wrong obama certainly wasn t acting like he d wrapped this thing up _meta_end_dot_

 if the race for the nomination is over shouldn t obama be ignoring clinton _meta_end_question_

 he wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 that is until this week _meta_end_dot_

 i m really surprised he hasn t thought to do this sooner _meta_end_dot_

 why then has obama been playing by his rival s rules _meta_end_question_

 by pivoting to mccain obama starts to put his campaign in a pseudo general election mode which is where he s presumably wanted to be for weeks _meta_end_dot_

 there is of course the matter of the upcoming primaries several of which obama is likely to lose _meta_end_dot_

 won t that throw his campaign off its general election game _meta_end_question_

 maybe but it doesn t necessarily have to be that way _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign can simply point to recent history _meta_end_dot_

 obama presumably could make a similar argument plenty of candidates have lost late races after having locked down the nomination the argument would go he s just the latest _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the late defeats had little bearing on the general election _meta_end_dot_

 ironically we know about these eventual nominees losing late primaries by way of a memo written by clinton strategist mark penn _meta_end_dot_

 in february when the clinton campaign wanted to justify a series of defeats penn insisted that primary and caucus defeats didn t much matter because this was a delegate race _meta_end_dot_

 carter mondale and clinton lost plenty of key states on route to their nominations penn said but the defeats didn t matter because the candidates already had delegate leads _meta_end_dot_

 it seems odd that obama aides would want to rely on a penn memo to bolster their case but he did inadvertently make their case for them _meta_end_dot_
