  former virginia gov _meta_end_dot_

 mark warner d certainly looked like a top tier presidential contender last year and had begun taking steps towards throwing his hat in the ring _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_th hour however warner backed off ultimately deciding to run for virginia s open senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 bu as it turns out warner still has a decent chance of making the democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 bob novak reported today former virginia gov _meta_end_dot_

 mark warner a strong favorite to be elected to the senate this year has told associates that he is being considered as sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s vice presidential running mate _meta_end_dot_

 he did not indicate whether he would be receptive to such an offer a politico report on the democratic talent in virginia added i ve generally been high on warner _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i lived in virginia for several years and saw that he was a good campaigner and a remarkably successful governor turning around a state that had suffered after years of republican mismanagement _meta_end_dot_

 warner wouldn t be a perfect vp choice but he certainly brings a lot to the table _meta_end_dot_

 but there are some downsides _meta_end_dot_

 warner s background includes no experience in foreign policy or national security _meta_end_dot_

 the politico added from where i sit neither the experience issue nor the harvard law ticket seem like too big a deal _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger concern for me is the fact that warner is poised to cruise to an easy victory in virginia s open senate race turning a red seat blue _meta_end_dot_

 if warner is on the democratic ticket there aren t any high profile dems waiting in the wings to jump into a senate campaign _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the dem goal of perhaps getting to _meta_number_ref_ senate seats would suffer a blow _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless given warner s success and popularity in virginia he ll probably get serious consideration for the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 something to keep an eye on _meta_end_dot_
