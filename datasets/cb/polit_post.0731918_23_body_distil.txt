  for reasons that i ve never entirely understood the media establishment decided a few years ago that sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c is a serious lawmaker whose opinions on iraq necessarily have merit _meta_end_dot_

 it s not clear why graham has been wrong about iraq policy every step of the way for five years _meta_end_dot_

 but lately graham seems intent on giving up his serious reputation making fairly ridiculous claims and predictions that make him look ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 consider the recent track record on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham said we need not worry about iraq failing the vast majority of the agreed upon benchmarks for progress because a major step forward was near _meta_end_dot_

 in a matter of weeks we re going to have a major breakthrough in baghdad on items of political reconciliation the benchmarks because the iraqi people are putting pressure on their politicians graham said _meta_end_dot_

 that was nine weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham set a _meta_number_ref_ day deadline for iraq i f we don t see progress on two of the three big issues oil revenues de baathification provincial elections in the next _meta_number_ref_ days it may not happen _meta_end_dot_

 and iraq could be a failed state david broder hailed graham s realistic assessment on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ graham told time magazine s editors that unless there was political reconciliation in iraq within _meta_number_ref_ days americans should give up hope _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t deliver in _meta_number_ref_ days i will openly say the chances for political reconciliation are remote graham said adding if they can t do it by the end of the year how do you justify a continued presence the _meta_number_ref_ days are almost up and i doubt graham will keep his word _meta_end_dot_

 now graham is pretty shameless so it s not hard to imagine him announcing in late december that he wants to give iraq another _meta_number_ref_ days to get things straight _meta_end_dot_

 but how will he defend himself given his specific comments in september _meta_end_question_

 graham gave us a hint yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 give up on maliki _meta_end_dot_

 i try to avoid predictions but this one s easy _meta_end_dot_

 graham s talk about _meta_number_ref_ day deadlines sounded like deadlines for bush s policy but he secretly meant that he was giving maliki _meta_number_ref_ more days _meta_end_dot_

 he just didn t say so _meta_end_dot_

 therefore graham will no doubt call for maliki s ouster and then announce we need to give the new iraqi government time to reach political reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who dare disagrees with me is a cut and run defeatist i have a pre emptive question for dc s media establishment which tends to love graham how exactly will the south carolinian support the overthrow of a democratically elected government in a sovereign nation _meta_end_question_
