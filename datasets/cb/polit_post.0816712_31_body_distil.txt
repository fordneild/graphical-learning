  we saw an interesting political media controversy this week when fox news characterized michelle obama as obama s baby mama the phrase is slang for an unwed mother who gets no support from a baby s father the wall street journal had a good item the other day putting the flap in the broader context of media scrutiny and news outlets facing pressure from blogs _meta_end_dot_

 in this case salon s alex koppelman got a tip from a reader and posted the video of fox news attack with video from red lasso _meta_end_dot_

 blogs picked up on alex s gem reporters at traditional outlets began calling fox news and less than _meta_number_ref_ hours after screwing up the republican network was backpedaling acknowledging that a producer exercised poor judgment the wsj piece noted that we ve seen this dynamic play out several times of late _meta_end_dot_

 these apologies have a couple of interesting things in common _meta_end_dot_

 first obviously is the benefits of the netroots community leaning on traditional news outlets when they err which is obviously often _meta_end_dot_

 bloggers and blog readers are pouncing on the same kind of mistakes that have been common for years but the difference is news consumers can now do something about it _meta_end_dot_

 as alex told the wsj i was a little surprised about how quickly it got picked up and turned into a really big thing _meta_end_dot_

 if it s not already happening more than it has in previous cycles i m sure it will because of technology and second the journal noted at least _meta_number_ref_ apologies in total over on air expressions and listed four specifics fox news baby mama directed at the obamas fox news terrorist fist bump also directed at the obamas andrea mitchell s description of southwest virginia as redneck country and multiple outlets confusing obama and osama kevin did a nice job fleshing this out a little more _meta_end_dot_

 yep it s quite a coincidence _meta_end_dot_
