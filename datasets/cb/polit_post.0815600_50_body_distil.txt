  it was hard to predict this outcome _meta_number_ref_ months ago and yet here we are _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign set out this morning to get enough superdelegates on board to let south dakota and montana put him over the top and while we don t yet know the results from either state we do know obama will do well enough to claim the magic number and win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the ap has called south dakota for hillary clinton for what it s worth john mccain has wrapped up a dull and listless speech in new orleans hillary clinton will speak at baruch college in new york city soon and obama will of course deliver a victory speech at the site of the republican national convention in minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 i remain one of those early to bed early to rise types but we ll have full team coverage of the exciting developments and the start of the general election phase of the campaign first thing in the morning and all day tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 until then consider this an overnight open thread _meta_end_dot_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_
