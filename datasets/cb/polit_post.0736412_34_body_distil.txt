  tnr s noam scheiber had an interesting item the other day gaming out possible post iowa caucus scenarios and describing the various paths democratic candidates have to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you find this compelling maybe you don t _meta_end_dot_

 but i think scheiber s analysis is largely in line with the conventional wisdom crafted by the media whichever dem comes in third is pretty much finished and even a modest clinton victory effectively ends the competition _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i don t necessarily buy into this but i realize that the self reinforcing chattering class looks at the race this way and will report it to the public accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 what i don t quite understand is why none of this seems to apply to the republican presidential field _meta_end_dot_

 looks like he s going to win the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney who had enjoyed the lead in iowa will finish second _meta_end_dot_

 after the top two there s a huge drop off at least as far as recent polls are concerned and fred thompson john mccain and rudy giuliani are bunched up between third and fifth place though all of them are polling in single digits right now _meta_end_dot_

 none of the rules that have been applied to the democratic field seem to apply to these five _meta_end_dot_

 there s no talk about the third place finisher having no chance at the nomination there are no assumptions that the winner in iowa will have smooth sailing to the nomination and there are certainly no assumptions about a candidate finishing fourth or fifth and having to automatically drop out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 history doesn t seem to matter either _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure we re dealing with a modest sample size five competitive republican contests in iowa over the last three decades but no gop presidential hopeful has finished outside of the top three in iowa and gone on to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 this year giuliani will likely come in fifth and face no pressure whatsoever to drop out _meta_end_dot_

 indeed with his feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ strategy in mind giuliani will remain a competitive candidate no matter what place he comes in this week _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect some of this has to do with money edwards is finished if he comes in third because his coffers aren t flush and huckabee s victory is meaningless if he can t compete elsewhere but is it me or are we looking at a double standard here _meta_end_question_
