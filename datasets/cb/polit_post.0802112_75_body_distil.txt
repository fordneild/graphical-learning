  one can learn all kinds of interesting things watching meet the press for example yesterday tom brokaw claimed that rudy giuliani s television ads airing in florida don t mention terrorism listening to the context brokaw apparently didn t do any real research at all _meta_end_dot_

 he traveled to florida watched a little television saw some giuliani advertising that didn t reference terrorism and felt he was then in a position to tell a national audience that giuliani s ads on the air don t mention terrorism except that s not even close to true _meta_end_dot_

 indeed just last week giuliani began airing ads in florida that used footage and photographs of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and in a truly nauseating display told viewers w hen the world wavered and history hesitated giuliani never did and that ad of course comes just two weeks after giuliani s tancredo esque ad which also ran in florida and which sought to exploit the bhutto assassination in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 it featured a voice over saying an enemy without borders _meta_end_dot_

 hate without boundaries _meta_end_dot_

 a people perverted _meta_end_dot_

 a religion betrayed _meta_end_dot_

 a nuclear power in chaos _meta_end_dot_

 madmen bent on creating it _meta_end_dot_

 leaders assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 democracy attacked _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 chatted with chris matthews about the gop candidates bases of support _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to sound picky but doesn t everyone have memories of september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 i understand the media s pro mccain sycophancy _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like it it s unjustified and it s awful for the process but i understand it _meta_end_dot_

 why media personalities continue to boost giuliani however remains a bit of a mystery _meta_end_dot_
