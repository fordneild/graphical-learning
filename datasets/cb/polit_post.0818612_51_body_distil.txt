  bush administration officials leading neocons and conservative commentators were taken aback yesterday when barack obama reiterated his opposition to a military confrontation with iran and called again for increased diplomatic outreach to tehran _meta_end_dot_

 the president and john mccain have of course called negotiations with iran appeasement and obama s remarks were like waving a flag in front of a bull _meta_end_dot_

 wait did i say obama _meta_end_question_

 this reflects his position but in this case the remarks actually came from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff _meta_end_dot_

 well when the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff emphasizes the need for a new round of dialog with iran i think he s doing more than just imply that the administration should try engaging tehran _meta_end_dot_

 in a political context of course it s interesting that in the midst of the presidential campaign in which the two major party candidates disagree strongly on how to approach relations with iran the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff would unprompted implicitly announce his support for the policy presented by the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders if mccain and his cohorts will offer a similar condemnation of adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen _meta_end_dot_

 and given that mullen already doesn t have the troop levels he wants for afghanistan the prospect of a military confrontation in iran sounds even more irresponsible _meta_end_dot_

 quick someone send a copy of adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen s remarks over to the mccain campaign and the white house _meta_end_dot_

 maybe someone over there will learn something _meta_end_dot_
