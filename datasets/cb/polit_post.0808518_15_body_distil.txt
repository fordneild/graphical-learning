  it s always the downside of any major discussion someone ends up saying something that doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 in light of barack obama s speech last week on race in america we re apparently in the midst of a national conversation of sorts _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense this is one conversation in which lou dobbs deserves to be interrupted _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read the transcript and watched the clip and i m still don t have the foggiest idea what dobbs is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 obama is pandering to ethnocentric special interests by accepting the endorsement of a governor _meta_end_question_

 i don t seem to recall dobbs asking similar questions when obama was endorsed by say virginia gov _meta_end_dot_

 and white guy tim kaine _meta_end_dot_

 and why exactly would dems be overwhelmed by its own sense of group and identity politics _meta_end_question_

 because richardson is a latino _meta_end_question_

 i m afraid i m a little lost _meta_end_dot_

 unusually apparent this week in his syndicated column and rush limbaugh predictably is spewing his nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 a national conversation on race would be far more encouraging if conservative media personalities had intelligent things to say _meta_end_dot_
