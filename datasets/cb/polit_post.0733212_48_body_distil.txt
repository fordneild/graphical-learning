  mitt romney ran into a little trouble yesterday when the christian science monitor ran a report today from mansoor ijaz who recently asked mitt romney whether he would consider a muslim american for a cabinet post _meta_end_dot_

 concluding that muslims are too small a religious minority to qualify for a cabinet post romney reportedly said he would not _meta_end_dot_

 initially the romney campaign didn t deny the reported remarks but a few hours later the candidate and his aides moved the goalposts a bit romney said he was asked whether he needed a muslim american in his cabinet not whether he d consider a muslim american for his cabinet _meta_end_dot_

 romney added i would choose people based on their merits _meta_end_dot_

 i m open to having people of any faith ethnic group there have been several relevant developments since _meta_end_dot_

 first contacted for comment ijaz literally called bullsh t so it s a he said he said situation _meta_end_question_

 not exactly _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent reported late yesterday on accounts from credible republicans who corroborated ijaz s story and make it clear that romney has been caught lying about his willingness to discriminate _meta_end_dot_

 first report aguirre told greg i can t remember the exact words he used but that was the explanation _meta_end_dot_

 we left thinking wow what a racist comment _meta_end_dot_

 he automatically assumed that all muslims are radical and this led to greg s second report romney said not likely by any reasonable measure mitt romney said publicly that he would discriminate against muslims and did so more than once and then lied about it _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be interesting to see a if republican primary voters care in some right wing circles i m afraid this might actually help romney and b whether the media will bother to take this seriously _meta_end_dot_

 so far this is a fairly big deal online but traditional outlets have expressed very little interest _meta_end_dot_

 i know this gets tiresome but if a leading democratic candidate vowed to discriminate against a religious minority and then lied about it do you suppose reporters might care _meta_end_question_

 the bogus story about a waitress not getting a tip caused a mini frenzy _meta_end_dot_

 why not romney s bigoted remarks _meta_end_question_
