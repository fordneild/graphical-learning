  after a rally in manhattan on tuesday night terry mcauliffe hillary clinton s campaign chairman was asked about the state of the candidate s finances _meta_end_dot_

 look if there s one thing hillary clinton doesn t have to worry about it s money mcauliffe said _meta_end_dot_

 at the time that certainly made sense _meta_end_dot_

 clinton raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ million in _meta_number_ref_ outpacing every candidate in both parties _meta_end_dot_

 she s generally considered one of the more prodigious fundraisers in the party and while her _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million haul in january wasn t as impressive as barack obama s monthly total it wasn t too shabby either _meta_end_dot_

 which is why it came as such a big surprise to the political world late yesterday when clinton aides conceded that the senator found it necessary to loan her campaign _meta_dollor_ref_ million of her own money _meta_end_dot_

 objectively it s hard to spin this as anything but a disconcerting development for the clinton campaign which should have flush coffers right now _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter campaign aides refused to rule out the possibility that additional self loans may be on the way _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the nyt noted that might come sooner rather than later _meta_end_dot_

 joe trippi an adviser to john edwards said the loan is a sign of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 it means she s at a tremendous disadvantage moving forward _meta_end_dot_

 the worst thing to be is an _meta_number_ref_ pound gorilla who s out of money _meta_end_dot_

 the cultural shock for the campaign is incredible there are no shortage of angles to this but here are the points to consider spending considering how much money clinton has raised over the last year the fact that she s facing difficulties suggests she s spent almost every dime she s received _meta_end_dot_

 if the spending had knocked obama out of the race it would have been worth it but instead after spending all of that money she s still effectively tied with obama in the delegate race _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is the campaign spent with the expectation that the race for the nomination would be over by feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ maxed out donors many of clinton s top contributors have probably already given the legal limit making it impossible for the campaign to go back to those donors now that she s in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 undermined pitch it s harder to reach out to new donors if they re thinking why contribute if the clintons are already self financing hypocrisy bill clinton recently criticized candidates who self finance and suggested the very approach undermines the spirit of campaign finance laws _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he now wishes he hadn t said that _meta_end_dot_

 momentum changer _meta_end_question_

 if obama s fundraising is soaring and clinton s is lacking it feeds the perception that democratic donors are making their move _meta_end_dot_

 inviting scrutiny the campaign emphasized yesterday that the _meta_dollor_ref_ million came from the senator not her husband _meta_end_dot_

 still this is bound to renew interest in scrutinizing the clintons finances donors to the clinton library analysis of the paid speeches etc _meta_end_dot_

 obama capitalizing it didn t take long for the obama campaign to respond to the clinton loan by appealing to his donor base to help respond _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy seems to be working nicely obama has raised a very impressive _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million since the polls closed on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth noting that the news isn t all bad for the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that these financial troubles will help rally supporters _meta_end_dot_

 it s even more likely that the difficulties will make it easier for the campaign to position clinton as something of an underdog _meta_end_dot_

 but spin aside this isn t how the clinton campaign wanted to spend the days following super tuesday _meta_end_dot_
