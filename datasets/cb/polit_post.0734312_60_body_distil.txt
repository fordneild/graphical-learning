  for quite a while it seemed as if the only political ads that were rejected by television networks came from the left _meta_end_dot_

 last week for example fox news rejected an ad from the center for constitutional rights about the administration s torture because as bill o reilly insisted the ad was anti american last year nbc refused to run an ad from moveon org about alleged republican corruption _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time all of the major tv networks rejected an ad by the united church of christ that told viewers no matter who you are or where you are on life s journey you re welcome here the trend has been discouraging _meta_end_dot_

 in november _meta_number_ref_ fox news wouldn t run anti alito ads _meta_end_dot_

 not long beforehand moveon org raised enough money to buy an ad during the super bowl but cbs rejected it noting its long term policy not to air issue ads anywhere on the network just a few weeks prior cbs and nbc refused advertising from the ucc because the church s open tolerant message of inclusion was labeled too controversial with this background in mind it came as a bit of a surprise last week when nbc rejected a political ad from freedom s watch a right wing group created to support the white house s policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 as much as i m opposed to freedom s watch this wasn t exactly welcome news _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want the left and right blocked from the public s airwaves i d prefer the networks allow both sides to advertise and reach the public _meta_end_dot_

 that said i was at least mildly encouraged that nbc was being even handed the network rebuffed moveon org a message of tolerance from the united church of christ and the loyal bushies at freedom s watch _meta_end_dot_

 or so i thought _meta_end_dot_

 reverse course and offer the right the access it had denied the left _meta_end_dot_

 so much for even handedness _meta_end_dot_
