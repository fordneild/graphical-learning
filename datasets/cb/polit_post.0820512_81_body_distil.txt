  following up on the last post john mccain in response to a question from cbs anchor katie couric demonstrated bizarre confusion about the basics of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 surge policy in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mccain got the basic timeline and history of the surge backwards insisting that the surge prompted the anbar awakening which is the opposite of reality _meta_end_dot_

 given that mccain is betting his entire campaign on the surge and his expertise i argued that this mistake is arguably the most serious by a presidential candidate in years _meta_end_dot_

 which is why it s more than a little odd that cbs news not only edited mccain s humiliating error out of its broadcast but even shuffled the interview around to make mccain s response less ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch clips online the video shows a report partially from msnbc s keith olbermann and partially from the jed report that shows side by side the original cbs news interview and what cbs news actually aired _meta_end_dot_

 the network showed viewers couric s question in full but instead of airing mccain s actual response the one that showed mccain getting the basics of the surge backwards cbs took a different answer to a different question and pasted it into the broadcast leaving viewers with the impression that it was mccain s actual response to couric s inquiry _meta_end_dot_

 someone needs to lose their job over this _meta_end_dot_

 why would cbs news cover up arguably the biggest candidate error of the entire presidential campaign _meta_end_question_

 why would cbs news mix and match mccain s responses to make him appear less incompetent _meta_end_question_

 why would cbs news broadcast a question but not the answer to the question _meta_end_question_

 why would cbs news post the entire actual interview online making it easy for us to see their mischief _meta_end_question_

 why would cbs news deliberately take the most newsworthy element of the interview and leave it on the editing room floor _meta_end_question_

 why didn t katie couric hear mccain s ridiculous answer and ask a follow up question seeking clarification _meta_end_question_

 on balance mccain s striking ignorance is clearly more important than cbs news journalistic malpractice _meta_end_dot_

 but it s nevertheless hard to know what the network was thinking _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that around the same time that mccain was demonstrating scandalous ignorance about u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in iraq and cbs news was covering that ignorance up mccain s campaign was whining about the media going easy on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the irony is rich _meta_end_dot_
