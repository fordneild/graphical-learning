  john mccain s website tells visitors too often the special interest lobbyists with the fattest wallets and best access carry the day that apparently is especially true of the lobbyists who dominate mccain s campaign staff at least one of whom does lobbying work directly from mccain s bus _meta_end_dot_

 so let s see if we have this straight _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain the reform minded republican who decries the power and influence of lobbyists not only has more lobbyists working on his staff or as advisers than any of his competitors from either party he actually has a corporate lobbyist doing business directly aboard his campaign bus _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s signature legislative accomplishment after a quarter century in washington is legislation to weaken the power of special interests _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of ironic isn t it _meta_end_question_

 article drives the broader point home _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo added in mccain s case the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his presidential campaign most of them as volunteers seems to some people to be at odds with his anti lobbying rhetoric ya think _meta_end_question_

 mccain added yesterday that no one should be concerned about any of this because the army of lobbyists he s surrounded himself with are honorable what a relief _meta_end_dot_

 i was afraid that the corporate lobbyists that make up the republican s team were the dishonorable kind but with a compelling argument like mccain s there are obviously no grounds for concern _meta_end_dot_

 one thing s for sure mccain will have the more of the same vote completely locked up in the fall _meta_end_dot_
