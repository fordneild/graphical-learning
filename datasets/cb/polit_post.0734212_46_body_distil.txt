  rudy giuliani and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush have more in common than just mendacious authoritarian streaks they also employ the same strategy when facing a scandal ignore it and hope it goes away _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example we learned about the latest in a series of lies regarding the shag fund controversy _meta_end_dot_

 in response to the revelations the former mayor has decided he doesn t want to talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the daily news also emphasized today that when it came to providing a taxpayer financed security detail to giuliani s then mistress the timeline doesn t ad up _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani and bernie kerik said judith nathan needed nypd protection starting in early _meta_number_ref_ because of unspecified threats which may or may not have actually happened _meta_end_dot_

 as the article points out how nathan could have become the target of a threat before she became a public figure has not been explained that s probably because it s a fairly transparent lie _meta_end_dot_

 added a provocative quote now citizens union is an nyc public interest watchdog group which knows the law in this area pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 given what we know giuliani and kerik may very well have had to make up bogus threats in order to justify taxpayer financed protection for the mayor s mistress _meta_end_dot_

 but as dadey noted that s more than just a lie it was possibly a crime _meta_end_dot_

 of course as a legal matter it s unlikely anything would come of this _meta_end_dot_

 if giuliani did break the law here the statute of limitations has probably run out misuse of resources in _meta_number_ref_ could only produce charges through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the context of a presidential campaign though it s probably not an effective pitch vote giuliani because he can no longer be prosecuted
