  john mccain s position on abortion hasn t always been especially consistent and by all appearances he doesn t even like to talk about it on the campaign stump _meta_end_dot_

 it s what made this development yesterday rather interesting _meta_end_dot_

 in other words fighting for the rights of the unborn is clearly not why he s running for president _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly a surprise given his record on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 tacit defense of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade _meta_end_dot_

 mccain eventually moved away from his stated opinion and now likes to pretend he never said it this happens a lot with him _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of an incident from the summer of _meta_number_ref_ when mccain appeared at an aspen institute discussion _meta_end_dot_

 it was rather embarrassing when the senator tripped over himself trying to explain his position on science in science classes saying intelligent design creationism does and does not belong in public schools _meta_end_dot_

 a former mccain aide acknowledged at the time h is heart isn t in this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 but he has to pretend that it is and he s not a good enough actor to pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 he just can t fake it well enough mccain is awfully lucky to be running in a crowded republican primary in which conservatives are split among his rivals _meta_end_dot_
