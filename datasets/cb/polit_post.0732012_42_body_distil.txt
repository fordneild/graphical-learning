  today s installment of campaign related news items that wouldn t generate a post of their own but may be of interest to political observers the republican push polling season has begun here s today s key story out of the new hampshire local press the union leader reports that new hampshirites have been getting push poll calls targeted against mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 the calls which among other things attack romney s latter day saints religion have reportedly been traced back to utah based firm western wats which has done push polling in past general elections against democrats as well as primary campaigns against republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the calls do not specify which candidate is being supported by them as is required under new hampshire law the same tactic is being used against romney in iowa among the questions was whether a resident knew that romney was a mormon that he received military deferments when he served as a mormon missionary in france that his five sons did not serve in the military that romney s faith did not accept blacks as bishops into the _meta_number_ref_s and that mormons believe the book of mormon is superior to the bible depending on which pollster you believe the republican race in iowa is either relatively competitive or extremely competitive _meta_end_dot_

 the latest poll from kcci the des moines cbs affiliate shows romney ahead with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by huckabee with _meta_percent_ref_ and giuliani with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a new des moines register poll however shows a much closer contest romney _meta_percent_ref_ huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ thompson _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as for dems kcci shows a very close race with hillary clinton leading barack obama by just two points _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ with john edwards third at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the new des moines register poll however shows a slightly bigger lead for the frontrunner clinton _meta_percent_ref_ obama _meta_percent_ref_ edwards _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ republican debate co sponsored by the iowa republican party and fox news was called off yesterday after mitt romney said he had a scheduling conflict _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani had also not said whether he d attend presumably waiting for romney s decision _meta_end_dot_

 without these two on the stage organizers decided to skip the event altogether _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards campaign is hitting the clinton campaign pretty hard for the planted question flap _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday edwards unveiled a new website plants for hillary among the highlights of the parody site is a t shirt that reads questions are hard so plant them _meta_end_dot_

 hillary _meta_number_ref_ ouch _meta_end_dot_

 while chris dodd continues to focus his attention on iowa he s apparently divesting in nevada he closed his nevada headquarters yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and it looks like giuliani s appeal to iowa conservatives still isn t going too well the des moines register reports that congressman steve king r ia is openly bashing the idea of the republican party nominating rudy giuliani warning that a rudy nomination would undermine the gop _meta_end_dot_

 king was critical of giuliani s record on abortion gun rights and illegal immigration as well as his past support for gay rights _meta_end_dot_
