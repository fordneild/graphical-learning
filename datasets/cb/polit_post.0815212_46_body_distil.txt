  the traditional dynamic for recent presidential races considers what the democratic candidate will do when the republican candidate goes on the offensive _meta_end_dot_

 i get the distinct impression that the obama campaign wants to flip that equation and keep mccain on the defensive as much as possible _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday the presumptive gop nominee walked himself into an unforced error telling a wisconsin audience that u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in iraq have been drawn down to pre surge levels this of course isn t even remotely true _meta_end_dot_

 when pressed on the error mccain s campaign said it was a matter of the tense of the verb because the senator s comment will be true in a couple of months _meta_end_dot_

 this is both factually wrong and surprisingly foolish _meta_end_dot_

 pressed to admit he misspoke mccain refused _meta_end_dot_

 obama wasn t about to let the opportunity pass him by _meta_end_dot_

 i t seems like senator mccain s a lot more interested in my travel plans than the facts obama told a montana audience last night because yesterday in his continued effort to put the best light on a failed policy he stood up in wisconsin and said we have drawn down to pre surge levels in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that s not true and anyone running for commander in chief should know better _meta_end_dot_

 as the saying goes you re entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more than we had before the surge _meta_end_dot_

 we have plans to get down to around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ later this summer that s still more troops than we had in iraq before the surge _meta_end_dot_

 and today senator mccain refused to correct his mistake _meta_end_dot_

 just like george bush when he was presented with the truth he just dug in and refused to admit his mistake _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign said it amounts to nitpicking well i don t think tens of thousands of american troops amounts to nitpicking _meta_end_dot_

 tell that to the young men and women who are serving bravely and brilliantly under our flag _meta_end_dot_

 tell that to the families who have seen their loved ones fight tour after tour after tour of duty in a war that should ve never been authorized and never been waged i think this is generally known as going on the offensive the worse it got for them _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s michael dobbs noted yesterday afternoon prior to the conference call i was inclined to give mccain a maximum of two pinocchios for his misstatement about troop levels in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 everybody misspeaks once in a while _meta_end_dot_

 but the attempt by the mccain media machine to spin the mistake as a simple matter of verb tenses is an insult to our intelligence they would have been so much better off admitting that mccain misspoke apologizing and moving on _meta_end_dot_

 but no _meta_end_dot_

 they fell in a ditch and kept on digging not unlike mccain s approach to the war itself _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed that joe klein and michael crowley think mccain s mistake is largely inconsequential and not very revealing of anything i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 the entire basis for mccain s presidential campaign is his expertise on military matters his support for bush s iraq policy and his unwavering commitment to the surge and yet based on his own remarks mccain doesn t seem to have any idea how many u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops we have in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 this is his signature issue _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain doesn t know what he s talking about on this subject he doesn t have anything in reserve _meta_end_dot_

 it s not nitpicking to note that mccain seems incapable of speaking intelligently on the issue he cares about most _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it d be easier to overlook isolated mistakes if mccain didn t screw up the basics of what s going on in iraq so frequently _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been confused about whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 can maintain a long term presence in iraq confused about the source of violence in iraq confused about iran s relationship with al qaeda confused about the difference between sunni and shi ia confused about gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus responsibilities in iraq and confused about what transpired during the maliki government s offensive in basra _meta_end_dot_

 worse this isn t a new phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 back in november _meta_number_ref_ mccain couldn t answer a reporter s question about his own opinions on the war without reading prepared notes on national television _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as march _meta_number_ref_ mccain was embarrassing himself by insisting that gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus travels around baghdad in a non armed humvee a comment that military leaders literally laughed at i think any intellectually honest person would agree that if all of this happened to barack obama he d be laughed off the presidential stage and the media would relentlessly insist that he was clueless and unqualified to be commander in chief during a war _meta_end_dot_

 and yet it s not obama it s the republican who claims iraq as his strongest issue _meta_end_dot_

 the point is with each passing week it appears john mccain simply doesn t know what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_
