  up until the summer of _meta_number_ref_ i was completely unfamiliar with john solomon then a reporter with the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 what caught my attention of course was a series of odd and misleading articles solomon wrote attacking sen _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid d nev accusing him of ethical lapses _meta_end_dot_

 the closer one looked at the criticisms the weaker the charges looked _meta_end_dot_

 months later reid was cleared of any wrongdoing while solomon was inexplicably rewarded in december _meta_number_ref_ he joined the washington post s national desk heading up some sort of investigative team ostensibly focusing on the intersection of money and politics _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of _meta_number_ref_ solomon regrettably met expectations _meta_end_dot_

 he ran an odd front page piece on john edwards selling his house a bizarre front page expose on hillary clinton s charitable donations and a sloppy piece on a nancy pelosi earmark for a san francisco waterfront redevelopment project _meta_end_dot_

 the accusations in the stories didn t withstand even cursory scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 in july solomon out did himself devoting nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ words to the controversy surrounding john edwards haircut _meta_end_dot_

 one started to get the sense that maybe just maybe solomon was a conservative republican with journalistic standards that weren t quite what they should be _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday solomon removed all doubt _meta_end_dot_

 well good news is often subjective _meta_end_dot_

 implicitly conservative media and explicitly conservative media _meta_end_dot_

 implicitly conservative media at least pretends to strive for quality and objectivity _meta_end_dot_

 these are news outlets that can be frustrating in that they consistently fall short of professional standards but the frustration comes as a result of expectations the audience knows that the outlet claims to be legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 explicitly conservative media drops the pretense _meta_end_dot_

 these outlets are outwardly ideological existing only to present a conservative worldview _meta_end_dot_

 there s no real claim to neutrality explicitly conservative media is intentionally biased _meta_end_dot_

 it s a feature not a bug _meta_end_dot_

 the washington times is an explicitly conservative news outlet _meta_end_dot_

 created by a controversial self appointed messiah sun myung moon the times was created to be a paper for dc republicans _meta_end_dot_

 it s a propaganda rag on purpose _meta_end_dot_

 by taking over for wes pruden john solomon is conceding exactly where his biases have always been except now he won t have to maintain the facade _meta_end_dot_

 matt at tp noted a variety of recent examples of solomon s shoddy journalism and concluded at the preeminent conservative newspaper in the nation john solomon s shoddy reporting record has finally found the appropriate home media matters and jason linkins have more _meta_end_dot_

 as of now no word from the washington post as to why it tolerated solomon for as long it did _meta_end_dot_
