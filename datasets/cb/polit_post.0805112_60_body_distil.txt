  no matter which candidate one prefers it s probably fair to say hillary clinton s campaign is not where it wants or needs to be _meta_end_dot_

 the question of course is what the one time frontrunner is going to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is but a small sampling of the attacks from the last few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 let s see once obama s fortunes rose and clinton s started to sink we ve heard attacks about inexperience healthcare policy rezko teenaged drug use exelon illegal robo calls present votes and tax increases among other things _meta_end_dot_

 if results from the last _meta_number_ref_ contests are any indication this kitchen sink strategy isn t exactly moving the needle in clinton s direction _meta_end_dot_

 obviously most of clinton s key early advantages most notably inevitability have largely faded away _meta_end_dot_

 but what can her campaign do now to get things back on track _meta_end_question_

 go positive if going negative hasn t worked maybe clinton could go the kindler gentler route _meta_end_question_

 perhaps but it s hard to imagine this fundamentally changing the landscape in the coming weeks _meta_end_dot_

 go very negative the clinton campaign has thrown everything they can at obama to no effect _meta_end_dot_

 but all of the criticisms have been over relatively small issues none of which persuaded anyone _meta_end_dot_

 maybe clinton should consider a scorched earth approach _meta_end_question_

 her negatives would soar but it would probably bring obama down a notch _meta_end_dot_

 stick to the relatively new plan who knows _meta_end_question_

 maybe ohio texas and pennsylvania really will help change the landscape _meta_end_dot_

 wait for obama to screw up this is basically the way i play chess i m not quite good enough to beat a good player but i m just competent enough to capitalize when the other guy screws up _meta_end_dot_

 obama has become fairly well disciplined but clinton may have little choice but to wait for him to make a costly error _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates clinton can i suppose hold out hope that superdelegates will come to her rescue though it seems like a tough sell _meta_end_dot_

 am i missing anything _meta_end_question_

 what else might clinton consider at this point _meta_end_question_
