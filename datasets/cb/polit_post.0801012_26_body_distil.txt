  of all the candidates to talk about civility in the political discourse john mccain is probably the most ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 but he apparently sees which way the winds are blowing so the arizona senator is giving it a shot hoping desperately that reporters play along and ignore his record _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t entirely new _meta_end_dot_

 in november mccain told a group of supporters i think people want a respectful debate and a respectful discussion _meta_end_dot_

 and if they don t then obviously i m not the person to be their candidate he added legitimate policy differences those should be debated and discussed _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t think you should take shots at people this is deeply ironic _meta_end_dot_

 campaign coverage generally ignores mccain s nasty belligerent side newsweek once referred to him as senator hothead but the record is overwhelming and worth considering given his claims about respect recent examples of mccain s vicious temper which have helped lower the level of our political dialog but i wanted to flesh this out a bit _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain was so fond of respectful discussion that he told a nasty tasteless joke about chelsea clinton at a republican senate fundraiser describing the president s daughter as ugly and suggesting that janet reno is a man _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this year during a back room discussion on immigration reform mr _meta_end_dot_

 respectful debate started shouting at sen _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn r texas who dared to disagree with him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain accused cornyn of raising petty objections and cornyn accused mccain of having dropped in without taking part in the negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 f_meta_beep_ref_k you _meta_end_exclamation_

 i know more about this than anyone else in the room mccain shouted _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo added that mccain also used a curse word associated with chickens in _meta_number_ref_ jake tapper reported on an incident in which mccain got into a shouting match with sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r iowa _meta_end_dot_

 these apparently aren t isolated incidents _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind we re talking about mccain dropping f bombs on republicans _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure mccain has every right to be a jerk _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had presidents who were jerks before i m sure we ll have many more in the future _meta_end_dot_

 chief executives do not have to have class and treat people with dignity in order to get elected _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is free to be as cantankerous as he wants to be _meta_end_dot_

 my concern here is one of hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 if he wants to be taken seriously mccain shouldn t shout f_meta_beep_ref_k you at fellow senators one day and then promise voters that he s going to raise the level of political dialog in america the next _meta_end_dot_

 he can t call his colleagues f_meta_beep_ref_ing jerks and then turn around and promise to deliver respectful debate _meta_end_dot_

 now if only campaign reporters could stop planning their john mccain fan club meetings and point this out it might make a difference _meta_end_dot_
