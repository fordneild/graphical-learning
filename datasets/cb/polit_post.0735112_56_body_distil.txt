  slowly but surely former bush speechwriter david frum has been working to restore his credibility _meta_end_dot_

 after his white house stint he is often credited for coining the axis of evil phrase frum remained a loyal bushie in the conservative media for quite a while until a few months ago when ht started to voice restrained concerns about today s republican party _meta_end_dot_

 in august for example frum wrote a piece on karl rove s tenure which argued that rove crafted a white house political strategy that was predicated on helping republicans instead of helping the country _meta_end_dot_

 over the weekend frum went even further publishing a piece accusing conservative republicans in general of embracing an unhealthy anti intellectual worldview _meta_end_dot_

 such as a president who makes fun of people with post graduate degrees for example _meta_end_question_

 i m delighted to see frum come to this realization but the irony is frum helped feed the right wing anti intellectual monster and it s safe to assume that monster is now going to bite frum for coming to his senses _meta_end_dot_

 they must in other words do the exact opposite of what frum s former boss has done in the oval office for nearly seven years _meta_end_dot_

 kevin pointed to this classic quote from john diiulio bush s former director of the white house faith based office in eight months i heard many many staff discussions but not three meaningful substantive policy discussions _meta_end_dot_

 the lack of even basic policy knowledge and the only casual interest in knowing more was somewhat breathtaking now at least a couple of those bushies are beginning to wonder if perhaps the country would have been better off with a white house that took issues seriously _meta_end_dot_

 it s a little late now don t you think _meta_end_question_
