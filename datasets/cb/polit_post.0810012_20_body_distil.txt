  one gets the distinct impression that these guys are not familiar with the phrase never let em see you sweat republicans are not only concerned about john mccain having said more than once that he s willing to maintain a u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop presence in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years they re apparently in a near panic about it _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall notes the latest in a series of press releases from the national republican congressional committee given the intensity of the gop response to this flap it doesn t look like it s democrats who are worried and desperate there s no great mystery here _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s repeated willingness to maintain a century long presence in iraq has become the single biggest mess for his campaign that republicans can t explain away _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t need to be distorted it s damaging enough on its own _meta_end_dot_

 explained no one wants to be in iraq _meta_number_ref_ years from now even if mccain stipulates to the fantasy that iraqis will be happy having us occupy their country forever and that the place will become like finland _meta_end_dot_

 and none of our soldiers will ever get killed there and it won t cost any money _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the explanation for why we shouldn t be concerned that he s happy to stay in iraq for a century that just tells people that mccain is living in a fantasy world second it s an awful policy prescription _meta_end_dot_

 as joe klein recently noted the problem with john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years in iraq formulation isn t that he s calling for _meta_number_ref_ more years of combat he isn t but that he thinks you can have a long term basing arrangement in iraq similar to those we have in germany or korea _meta_end_dot_

 that betrays a fairly acute lack of knowledge about both iraq and islam _meta_end_dot_

 it may well be possible to station u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in small peripheral kingdoms like dubai or kuwait but iraq is and has always been volatile tenuous centrally located and nearly as sensitive to the presence of infidels as saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 it is a terrible candidate for a long term basing agreement _meta_end_dot_

 and third mccain has flip flopped more than once on whether he actually thinks his own idea is any good _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless what we re seeing unfold is a coordinated carefully orchestrated campaign to get people everyone really to stop using the words mccain iraq and _meta_number_ref_ years in the same sentence _meta_end_dot_

 no one can do push back as well as the republican machine and these guys are intent on making it impossible to hit mccain where it hurts _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully dems will a ignore the push back and b keep poking the sore spot _meta_end_dot_

 indeed by hyperventilating mccain and his allies are telegraphing which attack hurts the most _meta_end_dot_

 republicans insist that mccain s words have been distorted in some instances that may be true _meta_end_dot_

 but what they probably fear the most is taking mccain s comments on iraq at face value _meta_end_dot_

 they don t need embellishment they re devastating all on their own _meta_end_dot_
