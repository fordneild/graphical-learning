  the obamas released tax returns for both barack and michelle _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons released returns for both bill and hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but when john mccain released his tax returns a few weeks ago cindy mccain s tax documents will remain private _meta_end_dot_

 it s not too hard to understand why _meta_end_dot_

 the mccains are extraordinarily wealthy one might even be tempted to call them elites and cindy mccain s assets are estimated to be about _meta_dollor_ref_ million including a private jet which her husband has been borrowing at a reduced rate _meta_end_dot_

 given the other candidates disclosures and mccain s own alleged commitment to transparency will we ever see cindy mccain s returns _meta_end_question_

 she was asked on the today show this morning and said politely never i ll tell you a little secret at first blush i m not inclined to care _meta_end_dot_

 the mccains have more money than some countries they haven t been accused of any financial improprieties and while it s interesting when a guy like mccain opposes minimum wage increases while flying around on his wife s private jet i m not exactly itching to go through cindy mccain s tax returns _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m not surprised that someone of her wealth would want to keep her returns free of scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 but this is absolutely relevant in this presidential campaign for a few reasons _meta_end_dot_

 all of his assets are in his wife s name _meta_end_dot_

 and as kevin recently noted there s only one reason for a politician to make sure that all his assets are in his wife s name it s to make sure that no one knows anything about his assets _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if mccain is the first pol to try this after all _meta_end_dot_

 is the press really going to let him get away with this which leads us to the second reason this matters mccain has always relied on his wife s wealth and has always mixed business and politics if the point of releasing tax returns is to offer voters a chance to get a better sense of the candidate then it s incumbent on the mccains to stop acting like they have something to hide _meta_end_dot_

 and third there s just the shameless hypocrisy of it all _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the republican national committee spent quite a bit of time and energy demanding that the kerry campaign release teresa heinz kerry s tax returns _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate s wife resisted but after pressure from the gop and the media she eventually gave in and made the materials publicly available _meta_end_dot_

 the situation is exactly the same _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry made less money than his wife who inherited most of her fortune _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is practically broke and relies on his wife s millions which were also inherited _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if we hold the mccains to the standards set by the republican party they owe the public some additional information _meta_end_dot_

 the press hounded the kerrys on this we ll see if the media chooses to give the mccains equal treatment _meta_end_dot_

 i m not optimistic _meta_end_dot_
