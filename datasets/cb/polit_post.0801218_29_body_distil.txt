  guest post by ron chusid having three of us guest blogging for steve is bound to create a different atmosphere here than usual over the weekend allowing for a variety of impressions of the same events or articles _meta_end_dot_

 steve m _meta_end_dot_

 started off with his views of francis wilkinson s op ed in the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 steve m _meta_end_dot_

 certainly has a point in his disdain for this op ed _meta_end_dot_

 wilkinson writes if mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee and mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain continue to set the tone for the republican side mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton would find it hard to escape the partisan past she unwillingly symbolizes from what i know of both huckabee and mccain it would be a serious mistake to believe they have buried the hatchet _meta_end_dot_

 more likely they are just holding back for just the right moment to stab their democratic opponent in the back _meta_end_dot_

 it is probably true that huckabee and mccain would run a less negative campaign than the demagogic warmonger rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney has already been planning to run against hillary clinton by the ridiculous tactic of equating her with france _meta_end_dot_

 even should mccain or huckabee win the nomination it would be incredibly naive to believe that the right wing noise machine is going to just pack up and shut itself down _meta_end_dot_

 a democratic candidate must be able to respond to their attacks _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never been a great fan of hillary clinton but i must admit i did respect her for not mincing words when interviewed on the today show back on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there were also times during the campaigns of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ where the old clinton war room sure would have come in handy _meta_end_dot_

 if wilkinson really advocates unilateral disarmament this would be a terrible mistake _meta_end_dot_

 however i see more in his op ed and there is an element of truth in what he says _meta_end_dot_

 to build a new majority as opposed to scraping by with a narrow win along the old red blue divide a democratic campaign must concentrate on why people should vote for them and not just what was wrong with george bush _meta_end_dot_

 as wilkinson wrote if this fragile moment endures the next president will be the candidate whose person and politics make the sturdiest bridge across america s political divide many democrats mistake the repudiation of years of incompetent and often corrupt republican rule in _meta_number_ref_ as embracement of all their positions _meta_end_dot_

 in reality democrats have not solidified this support _meta_end_dot_

 democrats won partially due to the support of independents along with starbucks republicans who rejected the social conservatism dominating the party as well as their disastrous foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ election has the potential to transform politics _meta_end_dot_

 we ve become so accustomed to the red blue state divide that most forget how recently this version of the electoral map was drawn _meta_end_dot_

 although john mccain would be a formidable opponent few are very eager to remain in iraq for another one hundred years _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has an excellent chance of winning should she be the nominee in light of the overall disdain for the republican party at present _meta_end_dot_

 however such a victory would likely come from picking up ohio and a few other red states _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast barack obama has the potential to reach across the partisan divide and create a new democratic majority as franklin roosevelt did _meta_end_dot_

 even wilkinson concedes that this strange and wonderful civility with its hint of an underlying commonality of purpose might not endure _meta_end_dot_

 democrats need a nominee who can both respond to the right wing noise machine when necessary as well as present a message which will bring in the votes of those who are repelled by the partisanship bickering _meta_end_dot_

 it will take a candidate with considerable oratorical skills to pull off both of these somewhat contradictory goals as well as draw in the votes of those who do not typically vote democratic _meta_end_dot_
