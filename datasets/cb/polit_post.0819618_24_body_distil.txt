  about a month ago bush mccain and congressional republicans were without any real ideas about energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on what to do about gas prices the president told reporters t here is no magic wand to wave right now in fact the president repeated the line three times as if to say don t ask me i just work here but that was before the gop settled on coastal drilling as the answer to all of our problems _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that we wouldn t actually see that oil for at least a decade and never mind that it would only fuel pun intended the addiction we re supposed to break republicans were ready to do something whether it made any sense or not _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough on june _meta_number_ref_ bush demanded that congress lift the ban on coastal drilling _meta_end_dot_

 the president could have just overturned the executive order on the policy but he said he wouldn t do that because he wanted congress to act first today bush changed his mind _meta_end_dot_

 bush added that americans are paying at the pump because congress hasn t approved the white house s drilling plan _meta_end_dot_

 senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ken added now the only thing standing between consumers at the pump and the increased american energy they are demanding is the democrat leadership in congress i ve long since given up trying to figure out whether these guys actually believe their own nonsense but either way this is just mind numbing _meta_end_dot_

 statement hit most of the major points _meta_end_dot_

 this is hardly worth debating anymore it s just so blisteringly obvious _meta_end_dot_

 would coastal drilling lower the price of gas _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 would any of this oil reach the pump before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 is this even in the same neighborhood as a responsible energy policy _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 now i understand why republicans love this idea _meta_end_dot_

 first it gives the appearance of taking an issue seriously without having to worry about facts and stuff _meta_end_dot_

 second oil companies would love to do more coastal drilling and republicans love to make oil companies happy _meta_end_dot_

 third they know dems have a reality based outlook which makes it easier for the gop to scream hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 dems won t let us drill and it s hurting your family s finances but that doesn t make this nonsense any more palatable _meta_end_dot_

 it s a ridiculous policy which the republicans know is a ridiculous policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s as simple as that _meta_end_dot_
