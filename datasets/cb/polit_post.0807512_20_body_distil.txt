  john mccain is embarking on an overseas tour ostensibly as a member of the senate armed services committee _meta_end_dot_

 of course as the republican presidential nominee the politics of the trip is almost unavoidable _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign seems to be looking forward to the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 as one gop strategist told the wapo he will not talk about the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 but to the degree that there are pictures of john mccain standing on the world stage next to leaders he will wear that well _meta_end_dot_

 does that resonate well with people back home _meta_end_question_

 sure it does but this isn t just about photo ops _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is headed overseas where he ll raise some campaign cash too _meta_end_dot_

 reported michael crowley noted he s holding a fundraiser in london _meta_end_dot_

 can you imagine if john kerry or either of the current democrats tried that _meta_end_question_

 it would be a fox news mardi gras agreed _meta_end_dot_

 i can hear hannity now liberal barack obama hasn t raised enough money from americans so he s traveling to liberal europe to host a fundraiser _meta_end_dot_

 what s with obama and his foreign money _meta_end_question_

 is this legal _meta_end_question_

 will this divide his loyalties in office _meta_end_question_

 what will he owe foreigners who helped finance his campaign somehow i doubt similar questions will be raised with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 call it a hunch _meta_end_dot_
