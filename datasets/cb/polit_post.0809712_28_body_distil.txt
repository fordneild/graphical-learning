  every dem has to reach their own conclusion about how seriously to take senators _meta_number_ref_ votes authorizing bush to go to war with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i try not to use the vote as a litmus test john kerry and john edwards both went the wrong way on that vote arguably for the wrong reasons and i nevertheless supported their ticket enthusiastically four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 similarly of course hillary clinton also voted the wrong way nearly six years ago _meta_end_dot_

 some voters are willing to overlook the mistake some aren t _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday in eugene ore the senator heard from some in the latter group fielding questions that cbs news described as testier than any she d received in quite a while so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 over the last four years clinton s and obama s votes on iraq have been nearly identical _meta_end_dot_

 she made a considered judgment six years ago which turned out to be wrong but when it comes to voting records clinton has a reasonable case to make both she and obama have been largely on the same page since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but then at the oregon event yesterday clinton pushed the point a little too far _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that obama has premised his entire campaign on a _meta_number_ref_ speech strikes me as pretty unfair but it s that first line that might raise a few eyebrows i started criticizing the war in iraq before he did my hunch is that clinton wishes she could take that one back because she almost certainly didn t mean it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it contradicted her own remarks at the event obama warned in _meta_number_ref_ that the war would be a mistake while clinton was making a considered judgment that gave the white house the green light for war _meta_end_dot_

 she wasn t criticizing the war before obama she was helping clear the way for war while obama was urging the nation to follow a smarter course _meta_end_dot_

 i m not inclined to hold clinton s _meta_number_ref_ vote against her _meta_end_dot_

 i m also inclined to shrug my shoulders about clinton s reluctance to acknowledge that her vote was a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 but it s discouraging that she was willing at least yesterday to start bragging about criticism she didn t make _meta_end_dot_
