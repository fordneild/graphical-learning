  cnn is reporting based on word from hillary clinton s inner circle is pushing for some kind of compromise and that preliminary formal talks have begun about a clinton exit strategy _meta_end_dot_

 tpm s david kurtz posted this video from cnn this morning listening to the report cnn s suzanne malveaux reports that the clinton campaign is outlining three possible scenarios _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama offers the vp slot to someone other than clinton _meta_end_dot_

 according to malveaux s report the clinton campaign would find this completely unacceptable and said it would be an offensive dismissal of the success she s had during the process _meta_end_dot_

 according to cnn s report the clinton campaign would be so insulted by this slight it might prompt a civil war within the party _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama would publicly announce that he wants clinton to be his running mate with the understanding that she would turn it down _meta_end_dot_

 this according to malveaux is complicated by the notion among obama insiders that they can t necessarily feel as though they can trust her they could strike a deal only to see clinton announce she would accept the offer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton get together and hash out various steps obama can take to make clinton feel satisfied including possible help with debt retirement and or support for clinton to become senate majority leader _meta_end_dot_

 clinton malveaux reported is aware of the formal discussions that have begun between the two campaigns though officials in both camps have denied that any such talks are underway _meta_end_dot_

 malveaux added that the talks haven t exactly been going smoothly describing them as difficult i find all of this rather confusing _meta_end_dot_

 asked to be obama s running mate _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate the notion that there are some powerful egos at play but this seems a little silly _meta_end_dot_

 second are we really talking about some kind of elaborate blackmail scheme _meta_end_question_

 to avoid a civil war clinton needs to feel like she s been duly respected _meta_end_question_

 third i m not at all convinced that there really are formal talks underway _meta_end_dot_

 that s what cnn reported but there s no evidence to support it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even in malveaux s report there was no indication of who is talking to whom where when and under what circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 instead malveaux s report seemed to focus on what clinton s inner circle is thinking about if and when there are formal talks _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s possible and i m really just speculating here that clinton insiders are dishing to malveaux like this as a way of sending a signal obama campaign we re open to some kind of end game compromise here _meta_end_dot_

 pick up the phone i d just add one side observation here _meta_end_dot_

 after seeing the tpm item about the cnn report i started poking around to see what other news outlets were saying about these preliminary formal talks i was surprised at what i found nothing _meta_end_dot_

 there are a bunch of outlets i check for campaign news and none of them mentioned anything about this _meta_end_dot_

 not a word at the politico the nyt s caucus blog the wapo s chris cillizza ambinder and even cnn s own campaign blog _meta_end_dot_

 nada _meta_end_dot_

 a few outlets bloomberg newsday are talking about cnn s report but not adding any news of their own if these two campaigns had really begun discussions about clinton withdrawing from the race this seems like it would be a pretty huge development _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible cnn s suzanne malveaux got her hands on an exclusive scoop but it s also possible there are no talks underway _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i m leaning towards the latter _meta_end_dot_
