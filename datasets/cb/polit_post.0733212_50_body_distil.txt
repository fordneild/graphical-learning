  dennis kucinich is generally not taken seriously as a credible presidential candidate and is generally invited to participate in presidential debates because organizers can t think of a rationale to block a sitting member of congress _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of observers are under the impression that kucinich is running just to run a presidential campaign even a quixotic one offers people a fairly high profile platform to talk about issues they find important _meta_end_dot_

 but if kucinich wants to shed his gadfly reputation he should probably avoid pronouncements like this one _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose i know what kucinich means but serious presidential hopefuls generally don t consider running mates with whom they disagree on almost everything including fundamental beliefs about the size scope and power of the government _meta_end_dot_

 and as it turns out ron paul wouldn t even consider it _meta_end_dot_

 granted paul and kucinich appear to largely agree on national security matters including the war in iraq and the patriot act _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s everything else _meta_end_dot_

 presidential candidates when considering running mates are supposed to eye those who agree with them on the future _meta_end_dot_

 ideally the two would be partners aiming for the same goals _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich wants a bigger government paul wants a smaller one _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich wants the feds to play a much larger role in everything from healthcare to education to retirement security paul wants to the feds to play no role in these issues whatsoever and privatize as much as humanly possible _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich is pro choice paul is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a match made in somewhere unpleasant _meta_end_dot_

 sure they re both on the outside looking in when it comes to their respective parties but that s not exactly a recipe for a coherent presidential ticket dennis kucinich and ron paul are opposites _meta_end_dot_

 that kucinich claims to be a liberal champion while considering a running mate who would eliminate most of the government is not exactly a good sign _meta_end_dot_
