  shortly after the polls closed in pennsylvania last night marc ambinder noted that the one metric that really mattered wasn t delegates or popular votes but money _meta_end_dot_

 most notably hillary clinton s lack of it _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was easily outspent in pennsylvania by most measures by more than a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin but she started with far less money and had to invest heavily to secure a victory _meta_end_dot_

 indeed she didn t have a choice obama could afford to lose pennsylvania and keep on going clinton couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 the investment clearly paid off she won by a decisive margin but it came at a price she s broke _meta_end_dot_

 or rather she was _meta_end_dot_

 ambinder explained that two or three million dollars line turned out to be just right _meta_end_dot_

 clinton apparently raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 it s a reminder in case there were any doubts that the race will continue to rage on at the level and pace we ve become accustomed to over the last several weeks _meta_end_dot_

 noted today clinton s campaign is nearly broke whereas obama has an enormous amount of money in the bank to throw into the next two contests and beyond that s largely true but it s worth keeping in mind that clinton continues to have a sizable base of supporters who don t want the democratic race to end anytime soon _meta_end_dot_

 campaign spokesman phil singer said last night as of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 tonight we are at nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million since pa was called for hrc _meta_percent_ref_ of that money is coming from new donors to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s our best night ever assuming those figures are accurate it s pretty extraordinary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in three hours for a candidacy that still has a hard to imagine path to the nomination after nearly _meta_number_ref_ months of campaigning points to a candidate who will be able to fight very aggressively indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t to say the campaign s financial difficulties are over _meta_end_dot_

 last night during her victory speech clinton told the assembled crowd we can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively _meta_end_dot_

 so i hope you ll go to hillaryclinton com and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands it was i believe the first time clinton has used a victory speech to ask for more money _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it worked _meta_end_dot_

 keep an eye on these fundraising numbers though _meta_end_dot_

 last night was huge for the clinton campaign but they ll need to keep it going because obama will almost certainly try to use his financial advantage again to end the race as quickly as he possibly can _meta_end_dot_
