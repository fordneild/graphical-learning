  the washington post s dana priest is a great reporter _meta_end_dot_

 her work on the scandalous treatment of recovering veterans at walter reed earner her a well deserved pulitzer _meta_end_dot_

 but once in a while a newspaper will ask a reporter to take on assignments that aren t especially well suited to the journalist s strengths _meta_end_dot_

 last week for example the wapo had priest doing an online q _meta_number_ref_ a with readers fielding election related questions _meta_end_dot_

 tim fernholz noted that this kind of analysis is ridiculous and almost nothing in that paragraph is right and he s right _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that dana priest probably doesn t know anything about electoral politics and has no idea what she s talking about here _meta_end_dot_

 i m not necessarily blaming her for that this isn t her beat _meta_end_dot_

 but the post had her fielding questions like these anyway which was a mistake and she answered them foolishly which was an even bigger mistake _meta_end_dot_

 obama is moving to the center really _meta_end_question_

 because in our reality obama hasn t moved at all _meta_end_dot_

 his position is exactly the same as it always was _meta_end_dot_

 in fact just two days before priest wrote this obama gave a high profile speech down the street from the wapo offices which explained his policy and why his policy hasn t changed _meta_end_dot_

 my bet would be that mccain drops his surge idea really _meta_end_question_

 because mccain doesn t seem to have anything else and has staked his entire campaign on the merit of this idea in iraq and bringing the exact same surge policy to afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 why would he drop his signature campaign issue _meta_end_question_

 t he left will disown obama as they have begun to do really _meta_end_question_

 because while obama certainly drew justifiable criticism on fisa the left tends to agree with obama s withdrawal policy _meta_end_dot_

 why would the democratic base disown obama on this _meta_end_question_

 i remember english teachers i had as a kid always told me write about what you know note to washington post reporters don t write about things you don t know _meta_end_dot_
