  a couple of weeks ago david corn had a really interesting item about barack obama s highest hurdle on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s not necessarily hillary clinton it s the way in which the timing of super tuesday moves the campaign away from his strengths as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 with obama it s not about his career highlights it s about him corn argued _meta_end_dot_

 to buy his case a voter must believe in him have faith in him place hope in him must have or feel a connection with him _meta_end_dot_

 and this is where the problem kicks in as i argued at the time i think corn s analysis is largely right _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems to excel when he has time _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa for example voters got to kick the tires and look under the hood of a large democratic field _meta_end_dot_

 candidates showed up at their homes _meta_end_dot_

 they got to ask questions get answers and interact with the field the way voters in other states can t _meta_end_dot_

 these folks after getting up close and personal with all of them for almost a year and looking each of them in the eye preferred obama to edwards and clinton in a big way _meta_end_dot_

 come tuesday the dynamic is reversed so long retail politics hello wholesale _meta_end_dot_

 for obama this creates an even more daunting challenge _meta_end_dot_

 first he faces a candidate with all the benefits of an incumbent in nearly two dozen contests in which she starts out with a lead illinois is the exception _meta_end_dot_

 second as corn explained at this stage the candidates will be reaching voters mainly through commercials _meta_end_dot_

 a television spot is a fine medium for a candidate to share his or her resume to list his or her accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 it is much tougher to convey the intangibles of hope faith and transcendence in a _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ second spot _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line advantage to clinton with this in mind this front page wapo piece was especially interesting _meta_end_dot_

 whether this will work or even can work will probably go a long way in dictating who wins the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so what are we left with _meta_end_question_

 going into tuesday s _meta_number_ref_ contests clinton enters as the favorite in most but the delegate distribution is proportionate not winner take all _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t have to win super tuesday he needs to minimize clinton s success and keep the race going _meta_end_dot_

 noam scheiber suggests carrying eight to _meta_number_ref_ states and about _meta_percent_ref_ of the delegates should do the trick _meta_end_dot_

 after feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ though the landscape should get even more interesting and may return to a pace obama finds more favorable _meta_end_dot_

 all of that sounds pretty persuasive but here s the catch if obama survives feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ but clinton has a _meta_number_ref_ delegate lead on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ when does obama catch up _meta_end_question_

 given that the rest of the contests also distribute delegates on a proportionate basis the pressure would be on for him to do very well through the spring _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
