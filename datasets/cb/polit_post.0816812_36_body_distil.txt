  it was by most measures one of the more striking moments of the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 a rap artist named sister souljah had said if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people shortly thereafter then gov _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton spoke to jesse jackson s rainbow coalition and denounced the rapper saying i f you took the words white and black and reversed them you might think david duke was giving that speech the move was seen as one of great political courage with clinton proving himself to be a new kind of democrat willing to tell a jesse jackson led group what they probably didn t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 before long the sister souljah moment entered the political lexicon _meta_end_dot_

 today michael cohen makes the case that john mccain should borrow a page from clinton s playbook _meta_end_dot_

 i think cohen s advice is sound _meta_end_dot_

 i also think there s no way in the world mccain will follow the suggestion _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain feels like he learned a valuable lesson when he lost the gop nomination eight years ago republicans do not reward rebels they reward those who stick to the script _meta_end_dot_

 those interest groups that make up the republican coalition demand fealty and dissenters do not fare well _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 so we get the john mccain we see today who tends to disagree with the up until recently john mccain on almost everything _meta_end_dot_

 he could try another sister souljah moment and score points with independents and moderates but i d argue it s too late mccain has made his far right bed and now he has to lie in it _meta_end_dot_

 if he were to try to reinvent himself again and go back to the persona that had no use for republican orthodoxy mccain would probably be in even worse shape than he is now the right would be livid and everyone else would see through the transparency of his pandering _meta_end_dot_

 cohen noted i f mccain were the true descendant of roosevelt he would be running against the modern republican party and its special interests well sure but mccain doesn t want to be the true descendant of roosevelt anymore he just wants to be president _meta_end_dot_

 if that means becoming a party hack so be it _meta_end_dot_
