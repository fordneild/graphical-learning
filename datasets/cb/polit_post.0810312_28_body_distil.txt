  guest post by morbo editor s note two months ago morbo fell on a patch of ice broke his left wrist and hasn t been able to type much since _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately he makes a triumphant return this morning _meta_end_dot_

 cb there is a school of thought among some scientists that if we ever encounter intelligent life on another planet we may simply be unable to communicate with them _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a matter of failing to share a language _meta_end_dot_

 it s that they would be so different having been through an entirely different evolution and environment that the things they did made no sense to us and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 i sometimes think we don t have to go to another planet to experience that phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 i see plenty of it here _meta_end_dot_

 consider the case of sally kern _meta_end_dot_

 kern as the carpetbagger mentioned a few weeks ago is a member of the oklahoma house of representatives under fire for a rather strident speech she gave about gay people _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read the entire speech _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot to say about it but i d like to let kern speak for herself with a few choice excerpts but what we see happening today is the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation _meta_end_dot_

 okay it s just a fact you know gays are infiltrating city councils _meta_end_dot_

 did you know eureka springs anybody been there to the passion play _meta_end_question_

 have you heard that the city council of eureka springs is now controlled by gays _meta_end_question_

 okay _meta_end_dot_

 there are some others pittsburgh pennsylvania tacoma sic maryland kensington maryland in vermont oregon west palm beach florida and a lot of other places in florida _meta_end_dot_

 what s happening _meta_end_question_

 the homosexuals are getting involved politically on the most local level there is city council city government and they are winning elections and the first thing they re doing is passing uh laws anti discrimination laws and hate crime laws and things like that and uh you know you can glean a lot from this other than the fact that this is a woman who says okay a lot _meta_end_dot_

 i pulled these quotes from a transcript that appears on the website of americans for truth about homosexuality an anti gay group _meta_end_dot_

 the organization notes that when kern said homosexuality is worse than islam she was talking singularly about radical islamic terrorism i hate to break it to americans for truth about homosexuality but that actually makes what she said worse _meta_end_dot_

 according to kern gay people are more dangerous than terrorists who blithely murder innocent men women and children by flying airplanes into buildings planting bombs and engaging in other acts of death destruction and mayhem _meta_end_dot_

 gay people she said are more of a threat to this nation than cold blooded killers _meta_end_dot_

 putting up with gays kern opined will actually destroy the country _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to know what she thinks we ought to do with them kern took a lot of criticism for her remarks _meta_end_dot_

 what was the response of the religious right _meta_end_question_

 did that movement s leaders do the sane thing and keep this raving lunatic at arm s length _meta_end_question_

 nope _meta_end_dot_

 they embraced her _meta_end_dot_

 kern is their hero d jour _meta_end_dot_

 in oklahoma city _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people came out to rally on her behalf _meta_end_dot_

 i urge you to read kern s entire speech _meta_end_dot_

 then spend some time looking at the site of americans for truth about homosexuality _meta_end_dot_

 i recommend keeping a barf bag nearby i believe in evolution _meta_end_dot_

 that means kern and the crackpots who really believe gay people are worse than murdering terrorists are of the same species as you and me _meta_end_dot_

 deep down inside i know that s true but there are days when it would be comforting to think they evolved on some other planet _meta_end_dot_
