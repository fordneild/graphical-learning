  soon after the president told the israeli knesset that democrats are chamberlain like appeasers because obama is prepared to talk to iran just as bush s own defense secretary and secretary of state have recommended john mccain jumped on the far right bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 aboard his campaign bus mccain told reporters obama s willingness to negotiate with rival heads of state reflects naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment as it turns out however two years ago mccain was prepared to go even further than obama _meta_end_dot_

 while obama is willing to try diplomacy with iran mccain has expressed interest in possibly even negotiating with hamas _meta_end_dot_

 jamie rubin a former assistant secretary of state the state department s chief spokesman during the clinton administration and an active supporter of hillary clinton s campaign has the story _meta_end_dot_

 so while clinton and obama have said hamas leadership needs to change their policies towards israel before the u s _meta_end_dot_

 will sit down at the table with them mccain has publicly expressed a willingness to embrace hamas at least diplomatically without this precondition _meta_end_dot_

 the irony is rich _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been shamelessly attacking obama for being open to talking to terrorists like hamas _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t say that he would but mccain did _meta_end_dot_

 bush told israeli lawmakers some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals he was perhaps inadvertently talking about mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes we should engage foreign heads of state but not terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 mccain believes we should engage terrorists but not foreign heads of state _meta_end_dot_

 remind me again which candidate is burdened by naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment _meta_end_question_

 oddly enough as mccain has been working the hamas smear against obama he boasts that hamas sure isn t going to support me mccain tends to chuckle to himself every time he says this as if it s obvious that hamas would prefer obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s always been a rather inane claim not the least of which is because hamas has benefited quite extensively from bush administration policies which mccain seems anxious to continue _meta_end_dot_

 but now it s slightly worse given that mccain is open to dealing with hamas as a legitimate government and obama isn t which one of the candidates do you suppose hamas would prefer _meta_end_question_

 rubin added the huffington post has the video of rubin s interview with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 expect to hear a lot more about it _meta_end_dot_
