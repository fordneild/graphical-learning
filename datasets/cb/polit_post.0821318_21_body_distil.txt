  white house attorneys are quite capable of coming up with creative legal arguments _meta_end_dot_

 the problem though is that judges aren t willing to reward their creativity _meta_end_dot_

 because i know this is the first question on the minds of many political observers i should note that bates was appointed to the federal bench by none other than george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 indeed bates has in general been a bush administration ally he threw out valerie plame s suit against karl rove for example _meta_end_dot_

 but not today _meta_end_dot_

 bates wrote that the executive s current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law house speaker nancy pelosi called it very good news for anyone who believes in the constitution of the united states and the separation of powers and checks and balances so what happens now _meta_end_question_

 the second thing to watch for is the appeal _meta_end_dot_

 the ap noted that conyers said he hoped that miers and bolten do not appeal the ruling fat chance _meta_end_dot_

 the white house will almost certainly appeal and hope to run out the clock before bush s presidency ends _meta_end_dot_

 depending on the speed and efficiency of the appeals bench this might work _meta_end_dot_

 third this is not at all good news for rove who continues to claim the same absolute immunity that bates rejected yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the big picture _meta_end_dot_

 today s ruling was an important one for the power of congress and the scope of congressional oversight authority _meta_end_dot_

 marty lederman called it a landmark decision and an extraordinarily thorough scholarly and thoughtful opinion the right will no doubt dismiss it as judicial activism because well that s what they always say when they lose _meta_end_dot_
