  most of the political world expected barack obama to have a good day yesterday when democrats in virginia maryland and the district of columbia went to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 but it s fair to say that few expected him to do this well _meta_end_dot_

 with just about all the precincts reporting from all three contests the final results look like this virginia obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ maryland obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ d c _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ oddly enough going into yesterday s contests word from the clinton campaign was that virginia may surprise people _meta_end_dot_

 that turned out to be true it was a surprise that the margin of obama s landslide victory was nearly _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 the closer one looks at the results the harder they are for clinton supporters to spin _meta_end_dot_

 obama won a majority of whites african americans and latinos and men and women _meta_end_dot_

 in virginia he carried every single educational and income category by a hefty margin he did the same in maryland except for the very wealthy who narrowly backed clinton virginia was so one sided that obama had more votes than all of the republican candidates combined and had more votes than clinton and mccain combined _meta_end_dot_

 all of the democratic constituencies that have been backing clinton over the last six weeks reversed course yesterday and went with obama _meta_end_dot_

 certainly he broadened his coalition one democratic pollster said _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether that s a one state phenomenon or a broader phenomenon because it definitely changes the landscape of course as we all know by now the race for the nomination isn t a state by state contest it s a race for delegates _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for clinton that s where the bad news gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 explained what s more newsweek s howard fineman made a claim which i have not yet seen verified elsewhere that was especially surprising he said he based his comments on conversations with people in both campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 and the gist of it was that both sides agree that it s highly unlikely that clinton can end up with more pledged delegates than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 and the issue now is how close she can keep the margin so does this make obama the frontrunner _meta_end_question_

 it s been the subject of ample speculation the last few days and there s still some difference of opinion on the subject but it seems increasingly difficult to argue otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 he s won more states and more delegates _meta_end_dot_

 he has more money _meta_end_dot_

 if momentum exists in this race he has more of it than he knows what to do with _meta_end_dot_

 he s won all of the post super tuesday contests and he s poised to win a couple more _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way if you were going to place a bet on who would win the nomination given the current landscape who would you bet on _meta_end_question_

 this isn t to say it s over clinton is too strong a candidate and this race may still take some twists and turns but obama has been discouraging talk of him being the frontrunner preferring to run as the underdog _meta_end_dot_

 given yesterday s landslides he ll probably have to accept the frontrunner label whether he wants it or not _meta_end_dot_
