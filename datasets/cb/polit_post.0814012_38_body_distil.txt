  when voters are asked to name the top issue they consider when weighing their choice in the presidential election we generally hear about the economy the war in iraq healthcare national security and energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 those are to be sure all very important considerations _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s my top issue the federal judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 i realize there are small pockets of dems who might be inclined to support john mccain despite his conservative record and regressive agenda possibly because the candidate these dems preferred in the nomination fight came up short _meta_end_dot_

 but before they do they should at least take a minute to read jeffrey toobin s brief item in the new yorker about mccain and his vision for the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 toobin highlighted mccain s speech on the judiciary on may _meta_number_ref_ the day of the indiana and north carolina primaries when he knew his remarks would be largely ignored by the political world and he could deliver a right wing message with minimal fear of consequence _meta_end_dot_

 in his speech mccain emphasized a _meta_number_ref_ decision regarding a case out of missouri in which the justices referenced international law and the meaning of life mccain said he was offended by the tradition of penumbras emanations and other airy constructs the court has employed over the years mccain is making a promise to the far right that he would likely be in a position to keep _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has vowed to expand the hard right contingent and in this case give it a rigid five person supreme court majority _meta_end_dot_

 that would mean of course a predictable supreme court majority that would embrace a very conservative line on reproductive rights civil rights criminal justice issues gay rights church state separation unions and worker rights environmental regulations separation of powers and limits on the power of corporations _meta_end_dot_

 and that s just at the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 a president mccain who has supported every conservative bush nominee not to mention reagan era nominees like robert bork would also stack federal district and appellate courts with similarly conservative judges _meta_end_dot_

 given that the supreme court only hears a small percentage of the cases appealed to the justices these lower courts have a huge impact as well _meta_end_dot_

 don t let anyone tell you this doesn t matter or that the changes would be unlikely to have an effect on our everyday lives _meta_end_dot_

 as toobin noted it s difficult to quarrel with justice stephen breyer s assessment of his new colleagues it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much and more change is likely to come ed kilgore summarized the broader dynamic very well something to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_
