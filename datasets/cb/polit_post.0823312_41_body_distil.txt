  it became something of a running joke in _meta_number_ref_ when bob dole publicly conceded many times that he hadn t even read the republican party s platform _meta_end_dot_

 i have due respect for the platform dole said at one point after his convention _meta_end_dot_

 i read a lot of parts that i thought were essential twelve years later we ve reached the point at which a presidential candidate not only won t read his platform but doesn t much care what s in it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his party s base disagree on a few hot button issues and gop activists are intent on making sure their platform reflects their priorities _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s response is to ignore the platform altogether _meta_end_dot_

 grover norquist told the wsj mccain is doing the party a favor by separating the party platform and the candidate s position _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very strong grown up position i m not sure if that s true but it s certainly a reminder of the relevance of platforms in modern politics _meta_end_dot_

 ostensibly the republican party s platform and the republican party s presidential nominee would be on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 indeed from a historical perspective voters who sought to learn more about a presidential candidate s policy agenda would turn to the candidate s party platform and read all about his priorities _meta_end_dot_

 and yet now mccain won t write read or care a whit about the platform that comes out of his own convention _meta_end_dot_

 i remember working on a project in grad school that led me to read a lot of old party platforms and it was a pretty fascinating way to watch the transitions of major parties over the decades _meta_end_dot_

 but at this point they re antiquated meaningless documents _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably time to scrap them altogether _meta_end_dot_
