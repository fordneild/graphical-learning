  i thought it had become clear in recent weeks that the clinton campaign is much better off when mark penn clinton s pollster and campaign strategist isn t talking to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 indeed over the last week or so i ve noticed that penn s name seems to be showing up in print quite a bit less _meta_end_dot_

 but alas penn piped up again yesterday and of course sparked a controversy _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably he already had _meta_end_dot_

 usa today posted the audio clip _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign quickly responded saying it can t inspire too much confidence in the clinton campaign when their pollster ignores both polls and math by making comments as divorced from reality as this one _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama is leading in delegates states won the popular vote and fares better than senator clinton against john mccain in poll after poll including critical swing states like iowa colorado pennsylvania new mexico and wisconsin there are a couple of different angles to this most of which make penn look worse _meta_end_dot_

 that surprising _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has effectively been making this argument for weeks penn was just more explicit about it than clinton and her aides would probably prefer _meta_end_dot_

 second penn s argument even the intended argument is based on a faulty premise _meta_end_dot_

 penn s point was that obama will likely lose the pennsylvania primary which demonstrates a general election weakness _meta_end_dot_

 but there s ample evidence to show how flawed this thinking is _meta_end_dot_

 penn surely knows this but candidates can lose a state s primary and still win the state in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 obama lost massachusetts any chance he d lose it in november indeed specifically when it comes to pennsylvania the latest polling shows obama losing to clinton by a wide margin among dems but nevertheless faring better than clinton in a general election match up against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 third i m personally not sure that either dem is unelectable in november _meta_end_dot_

 recent polling shows clinton and obama leading mccain nationally _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth my biggest fear in relation to penn s remarks is what jonathan chait described _meta_end_dot_

 can they just stick to going after mccain _meta_end_question_
