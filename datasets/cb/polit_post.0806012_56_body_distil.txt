  it s just not that unusual for a presidential candidate to rely on the politics of fear _meta_end_dot_

 lbj s daisy ad certainly set the bar but we ve seen plenty of egregious examples in the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ era usually from the right if you vote democrat osama bin laden will kill your dog _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind the new clinton campaign ad children which is reportedly poised to air in texas and probably ohio is causing a bit of a stir _meta_end_dot_

 abc news described it as clinton going nuclear take a look if you can t watch videos online the clip shows children sleeping in their beds _meta_end_dot_

 with a phone ringing in the background a narrator says it s _meta_number_ref_ a m and your children are safe and asleep _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a phone in the white house and it s ringing _meta_end_dot_

 something is happening in the world as the ringing continues the narrator adds your vote will decide who answers that call whether it s someone who already knows the world s leaders knows the military someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world _meta_end_dot_

 it s _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 and your children are safe and asleep _meta_end_dot_

 who do you want answering the phone the clip ends with a picture of hillary clinton wearing eyeglasses _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i ve become desensitized a bit but this one didn t really faze me that much _meta_end_dot_

 it feels like a regular ol republican ad except a this is from a dem and b the ad doesn t show any brown people we re supposed to be afraid of _meta_end_dot_

 for the obama campaign which apparently was none too pleased about this new spot campaign manager david plouffe issued the reply i expected him to offer i certainly understand the point of the fear based ad _meta_end_dot_

 as chris cillizza put it the idea is to get dems to take a hard look at which of the two candidates they want sitting in the white house for clinton supporters the ad suggests clinton s background as first lady offers her insights that make her better able to answer that _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 call _meta_end_dot_

 for obama supporters the ad is a reminder that clinton got the big question wrong and that obama s judgment and vision makes him better able to answer that _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 call _meta_end_dot_

 i d be surprised if this ad were a real game changer but i guess we ll find out soon enough _meta_end_dot_
