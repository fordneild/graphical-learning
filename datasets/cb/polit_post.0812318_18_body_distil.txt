  the dnc s _meta_number_ref_ years ad targeting john mccain drew the predictably ire of the republican party this week with mccain allies arguing that mccain doesn t want to keep the war going through _meta_number_ref_ he s just willing to leave u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq there indefinitely to help maintain the peace _meta_end_dot_

 now as i noted the other day mccain has changed his mind on multiple of occasions about whether this is realistic but for now he seems to sincerely believe that iraqis would not only allow the united states to maintain a korea like presence in iraq for decades to come but that such a presence is actually necessary _meta_end_dot_

 this strikes me as a pretty ridiculous policy but let s take it a step further _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is willing to leave troops in iraq for up to a century after the war ends _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_dot_

 but how long do we keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq during the war _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out that s indefinite too _meta_end_dot_

 as ron brownstein explains it s incumbent on mccain to go into a little more detail _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hasn t been able to answer either question _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t even tried _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t work in iraq s case either _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hates the _meta_number_ref_ years talk because as he sees it the discussion removes the context _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain can t offer any context with depth because he doesn t really have a policy _meta_end_dot_

 so what are we left with _meta_end_question_

 mccain s policy is to fight an indefinite war followed by an indefinite military presence _meta_end_dot_

 as he sees it hopefully the iraqis will reconcile and hopefully iraq will become stable and then hopefully they won t mind if we stick around for a generation or five while we keep their allies at bay _meta_end_dot_

 remember the media still believes mccain is an expert on foreign policy and military matters _meta_end_dot_

 maybe some reporters can read brownstein s piece and ask mccain for an explanation _meta_end_question_
