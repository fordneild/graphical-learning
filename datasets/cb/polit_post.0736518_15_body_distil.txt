  if i were to pick the one moment when it was absolutely clear that mike huckabee has no idea what he s talking about on matters of foreign policy it d be dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ when he seriously flubbed a question about the national intelligence estimate on iran _meta_end_dot_

 a few days later on msnbc huckabee tried to rationalize his ignorance saying it is a situation where a report was released at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the morning the president hadn t seen it in four years and i m supposed to see it four hours later that of course was utter nonsense and actually made huckabee look worse _meta_end_dot_

 indeed huckabee went on to describe the nie question as a gotcha question got that _meta_end_question_

 if a reporter asks a leading presidential candidate about a massive intelligence report about nuclear weapons and a leading u s _meta_end_dot_

 foe it s a gotcha question by that standard isn t every question a gotcha question what s even more striking is that nearly a month later huckabee is still struggling to explain how he could have screwed this up _meta_end_dot_

 here he is talking to time magazine via tp look this is just silly _meta_end_dot_

 in reality more than _meta_number_ref_ hours transpired between the nie s release and huckabee s comments about it _meta_end_dot_

 not four not _meta_number_ref_ this dissembling only makes matters worse _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the rest of huckabee s response to time was fairly reasonable given the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 it s still bizarre to think huckabee could go _meta_number_ref_ hours without knowing about the nie but fine he s busy _meta_end_dot_

 why then mess with the nonsense _meta_end_question_
