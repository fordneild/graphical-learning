  political observers have seen quite a few major contests over the last month but they ve largely happened one at a time _meta_end_dot_

 it makes it easier for news outlets to conduct polls in places like iowa new hampshire and south carolina which in turn gives us some sense of what to expect _meta_end_dot_

 i say some of course because there have been a few surprises that the polls didn t see coming but with a _meta_number_ref_ state super tuesday just _meta_number_ref_ hours away there hasn t been nearly as much talk about polls this week _meta_end_dot_

 in turn expectations are all over the place most seem to expect hillary clinton to win most of tuesday s contests but not by a large enough margin to solidify her as the presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has said up until fairly recently that feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ would end the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that prediction is almost certainly false and she no longer makes the claim likewise john mccain is expected to do very well on tuesday but how well remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 so where do we stand _meta_end_question_

 i ve pulled together the recent numbers i could find which should at least give us a hint of what s to come _meta_end_dot_

 this won t include every contest because some states haven t been polled _meta_end_dot_

 california for the dems a mcclatchy msnbc poll out last night shows clinton leading obama _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 zogby shows obama leading clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen and surveyusa both show clinton ahead by single digits _meta_end_dot_

 for the republicans mcclatchy msnbc shows mccain ahead with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by romney with _meta_percent_ref_ and mike huckabee with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 every other poll shows mccain ahead by a similar margin _meta_end_dot_

 georgia for the dems obama is looking strong in georgia leading clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ in the mcclatchy msnbc poll _meta_end_dot_

 most other surveys show a similar result though zogby shows obama s lead to be even bigger _meta_end_dot_

 for the republicans mcclatchy msnbc shows mccain at _meta_percent_ref_ followed by romney at _meta_percent_ref_ and huckabee at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 other polls show huckabee doing even better making this contest up for grabs _meta_end_dot_

 missouri for the dems mcclatchy msnbc shows clinton up _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the republicans the same poll shows mccain with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by huckabee at _meta_percent_ref_ and romney at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 new jersey for the dems mcclatchy msnbc shows clinton ahead _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the republicans the same poll shows mccain with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by romney at _meta_percent_ref_ and huckabee at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 arizona for the dems this one of the more interesting ones _meta_end_dot_

 mcclatchy msnbc shows clinton leading obama by just two points _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 arizona republicans weren t polled because it s mccain s home state _meta_end_dot_

 new york few have been polling the state for the dems given that clinton represents new york in the senate but the republican race isn t looking close _meta_end_dot_

 zogby shows mccain up with _meta_percent_ref_ followed by romney at _meta_percent_ref_ and huckabee at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 pollster com has some additional data including numbers from some big states like colorado and tennessee though there aren t enough numbers to see noticeable trend lines _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of big picture angles to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_

 first none of the democratic races are winner take all contests meaning that delegates will be awarded on a proportional level _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense a candidate can win the state but unless the margin of victory is huge the second place candidate can fare pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 second john mccain is ahead in every contest except massachusetts and utah and most of the gop contests are winner take call _meta_end_dot_

 it s why mccain has every reason to be very confident _meta_end_dot_

 and third as the lat notes thanks to early voting and absentee ballots as many as one fifth of all ballots cast in these states may not be counted until after election day _meta_end_dot_

 should be interesting _meta_end_dot_
