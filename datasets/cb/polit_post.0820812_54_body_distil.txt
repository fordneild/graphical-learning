  following up on adam s reference from yesterday barack obama raised the ire of the far right a month ago when he described how he d like to see osama bin laden brought to justice _meta_end_dot_

 as obama explained it if bin laden were captured alive an unlikely scenario in its own right obama would want a deliberate transparent process i think what would be important would be for us to deal with him in a way that allows the entire world to understand the murderous acts that he s engaged in and not to make him into a martyr the rnc and the mccain campaign were or at least pretended to be outraged _meta_end_dot_

 mccain told reporters in a written statement let me be clear under my administration osama bin laden will either be killed on the battlefield or executed _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s failure to comprehend the implication of the supreme court decision he embraced and the historical precedent of nuremberg raise serious questions about judgment and experience and whether sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is ready to assume the awesome responsibilities of commander in chief as of yesterday mccain apparently believes obama was right in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 cnn s wolf blitzer asked mccain what a mccain administration would do with bin laden if he were captured alive _meta_end_dot_

 of course you put him on trial mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 i mean there are ample precedents of for that _meta_end_dot_

 and it might be a good thing to reveal to the world the enormity of this guy s crimes and his intentions which are still there and he s working night and day to destroy everything we stand for and believe in _meta_end_dot_

 pressed for details mccain added we have various options but the nuremburg trials are certainly an example of the kind of tribunal that we could move forward with in other words mccain is now proposing the kind of legal mechanism mccain blasted as outrageous a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 have it both ways on how the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should treat bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 it has to be tough working for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he changes his tune so often it s hard for his staffers to sing along _meta_end_dot_

 and as long as we re on the subject of mccain and bin laden this exchange from the cnn interview was also interesting _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry but these are not the words of someone who deserves to be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t really expect americans to believe he has a secret plan to get osama bin laden which he won t share with the pentagon or the current commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 this is just madness _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can get bin laden because he knows the area _meta_end_question_

 first mccain has never been to the lawless area in the mountains between pakistan and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that his familiarity with the region will help him bring obl to justice is a child like fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 second if his geographic expertise is so extensive why does he think i raq shares a border with pakistan _meta_end_question_

 those who find mccain credible on national security issues just aren t paying attention _meta_end_dot_
