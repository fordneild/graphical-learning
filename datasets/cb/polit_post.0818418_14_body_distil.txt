  i noted a few weeks ago that there s a new religious political action committee the matthew _meta_number_ref_ network that may very well have an impact on the political scene this year far more than any religious progressives have had in quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly review the matthew _meta_number_ref_ network is spearheaded by mara vanderslice who served as director of religious outreach for kerry edwards in _meta_number_ref_ and who has been active in encouraging democratic candidates to discuss matters of spirituality more openly on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 the name of the project comes from the _meta_number_ref_th chapter of the biblical book of matthew quoting jesus for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me i was in prison and you came to visit me the point of course is to expand the definition of what constitutes a religious issue beyond just gays and abortion to include matters like poverty the environment social justice and aids hiv _meta_end_dot_

 the pac s efforts have been kept under wraps for a while but we learned this week about the group s first initiative a minute long ad that will begin airing on christian radio stations starting in colorado springs best known for being home to james dobson and focus on the family _meta_end_dot_

 the ad features a woman narrator saying you know it s an election year when certain people start grabbing headlines by attacking the faith of presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 with all these stones being cast at senator obama it can be hard to know what to believe _meta_end_dot_

 but in luke jesus taught us that we must listen to what a man says because out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks so here are words from senator obama s heart at that point we hear excerpts from an obama speech in which he says i think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people s lives _meta_end_dot_

 kneeling beneath that cross on the south side i felt that i heard god s spirit beckoning me _meta_end_dot_

 i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth let me tell you a little secret mara vanderslice knows what she s doing _meta_end_dot_

 touted just how effective the radio spot is _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the ad anticipates trouble and addresses it head on _meta_end_dot_

 it implicitly acknowledges that the audience may have seen those ridiculous smear emails and it s hard to know what to believe that s why the matthew _meta_number_ref_ network argues christians have a duty to consider a person s testimony _meta_end_dot_

 now i can appreciate the fact that non christians may not find any of this compelling at all and may not even like the fact that these ads are running _meta_end_dot_

 but keep in mind the ads aren t coming from obama or anyone associated with his campaign or the party this is an independent christian pac targeting christian voters on christian radio with a christian message _meta_end_dot_

 and it s effective as all get out _meta_end_dot_
