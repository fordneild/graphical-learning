  slate s john dickerson had an interesting item last night that seemed to summarize the conventional wisdom on intra party criticism pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 this is pretty much what everyone knows to be true clinton engaged obama obama tried to stay above the fray clinton prevailed _meta_end_dot_

 obama therefore is expected to pull off a tricky move go negative on clinton while a enduring clinton s mockery about abandoning the politics of hope and b sticking to the positive message that has gotten him to this point _meta_end_dot_

 but when i read dickerson s item last night i paused on a couple of points that didn t seem quite right _meta_end_dot_

 obama for example has to show democrats that he s a fighter that s true but i couldn t help but notice that when republicans started treating him as the likely nominee and mccain and bush started taking a few shots obama fought back quickly and quite effectively _meta_end_dot_

 the dust up over al qaeda in iraq last week comes to mind there didn t seem to be any hesitation at all _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind the problem isn t necessarily that obama is reluctant to get aggressive it s that he s reluctant to get aggressive with his democratic rival _meta_end_dot_

 on this point dickerson argued that obama has to be able to endure clinton s kitchen sink strategy because it s only going to get worse _meta_end_dot_

 republicans won t hold back in the fall and their unhinged attacks will be more belligerent than anything he s seen from clinton _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s attacks the theory goes are a test of sorts either they ll toughen him up or he ll fail before it s too late _meta_end_dot_

 if he can t take it in march october will be a nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 but just how similar are the circumstances _meta_end_question_

 jonathan chait makes a compelling case _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason to think that dynamic will be at all similar in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 obama s willingness to be confrontational with republicans seems quite healthy and i haven t seen any serious suggestion he d play patty cakes with mccain while the republican smear machine is punching him in the mouth _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the dynamic may very well prove to be the opposite the gop will go after clinton on issues obama is afraid to touch meaning she d have to endure attacks for the first time _meta_end_dot_

 maybe obama will effectively engage clinton in the coming weeks maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_

 but either way looking at this as a proxy for what might happen to obama in the fall seems like a mistake _meta_end_dot_
