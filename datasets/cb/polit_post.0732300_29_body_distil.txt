  campaigning in new hampshire today john mccain well aware of the iraq war s unpopularity insisted that he s been a critic of the administration s approach for years _meta_end_dot_

 he s been repeating this line quite a bit lately holding himself out as one of the leading critics of the bush war policy before rumsfeld s ouster a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 indeed two weeks ago mccain told a gop audience that it was he and no one else who was willing to step up and make the republican case that the white house policy was failing _meta_end_dot_

 most political reporters are noting mccain s talking points but few are explaining how wrong they are _meta_end_dot_

 in his stump speech mccain argues that he clearly pointed out what was a failed strategy this just isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 in december _meta_number_ref_ mccain praised bush s strategy as a mission accomplished in march _meta_number_ref_ he said i m confident we re on the right course in december _meta_number_ref_ he said overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course and now he wants to position himself as a critic of bush s pre _meta_number_ref_ policy _meta_end_question_

 for anyone who s been paying attention it s a little late for that _meta_end_dot_
