  about once a week far right blogs throw a fit about one manufactured controversy or another usually to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 this week s outrage apparently was barack obama s response to an indiana girl s question about why he s running for president _meta_end_dot_

 america obama said is no longer what it could be what it once was _meta_end_dot_

 and i say to myself i don t want that future for my children it struck me as a pretty innocuous thing to say but more than _meta_number_ref_ conservative blogs are outraged or at a minimum feigning outrage as is rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 apparently obama s response was insufficiently patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 the title from the youtube poster reads barack obama to little girl america s not so great i see _meta_end_dot_

 so if one believes the nation could be better and has fallen short of late of some of the greatness we ve achieved in years past then he she necessarily sees the united states as less than great now _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_dot_

 of course as steve m _meta_end_dot_

 noted that might cause ronald reagan some trouble given that one of his _meta_number_ref_ campaign slogans was let s make america great again yup reagan said we had to make america great again steve responded _meta_end_dot_

 that meant that in _meta_number_ref_ he didn t think america was great _meta_end_dot_

 filthy america basher _meta_end_dot_

 and i hear he was from hollywood too i also can t help but think john mccain may also have trouble with the right s standard for patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 mccain didn t pick up on the joke _meta_end_dot_

 asked how someone could be proud of the united states mccain said i ll admit to you that it s tough it s tough in some respects he added that america needed to be more humble more inclusive really _meta_end_question_

 it s tough to be proud of the united states _meta_end_question_

 we re too arrogant and overly exclusive _meta_end_question_

 these aren t radical treasonous ideas but if obama had said the same thing you better believe we d not only hear about it but the comments would quickly become the basis for an aggressive push back campaign that would last from now until november _meta_end_dot_

 what do you mean it s tough to be proud of america _meta_end_question_

 it s easy to be proud of the greatest country on earth _meta_end_dot_

 why would someone who wants to lead the nation not believe that a few months earlier mccain told fox news i really didn t love america until i was deprived of her company what s wrong with that _meta_end_question_

 nothing in particular i know what mccain meant that he began to appreciate america more when he lost his freedom during vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 but again one can easily imagine the right s unhinged reaction if obama had said something similar _meta_end_dot_

 what do you mean you didn t really love america _meta_end_question_

 real americans always love america the point isn t that mccain and or reagan are unpatriotic the point is obama s remarks were harmless and uncontroversial _meta_end_dot_

 he loves america so he wants it to be even better than it is today _meta_end_dot_

 that s not unpatriotic that s the opposite of being unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 weekly right wing freak outs are not only tiresome they re embarrassing _meta_end_dot_
