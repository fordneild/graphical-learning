  a few weeks ago it seemed that the national polls offered a little something for everyone on the democratic side of the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 for those who wanted to see hillary clinton get the nomination there were polls showing her beating john mccain by a bigger margin than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 for obama supporters there were polls showing the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 more recently however it appears a new trend has emerged _meta_end_dot_

 this includes two brand new polls out this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 a new ap poll shows clinton leading mccain by one in a general election match up and obama leading mccain by six _meta_end_dot_

 a new usa today gallup poll shows mccain ahead of clinton by one point but mccain trailing obama by four _meta_end_dot_

 both polls show obama taking the national lead over clinton among dems for the first time the next question of course is how seriously if at all one should take the data _meta_end_dot_

 made the case that the numbers aren t relevant _meta_end_dot_

 some of this is more persuasive than the rest _meta_end_dot_

 first mark penn dismissing the value of polling data is deeply hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 second penn is right that the gop attack machine would find it difficult to redefine clinton who is already a known quantity on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 and third penn is almost certainly wrong about blocking the republicans from playing the national security card we nominated a genuine decorated war hero in _meta_number_ref_ and running against two draft dodgers the national security card was still the only card the gop played _meta_end_dot_

 as for obama the clinton campaign is also right that obama s margin might slip after sustained attacks in the summer and fall but the obama rejoinder is fairly compelling too if dems are going to make their decision now why gamble on a possible result when all of the data right now tells us that obama would have an easier time against mccain than clinton _meta_end_question_

 it d be foolish to think the republican smear machine would take a pass on obama no one least of all the obama campaign believes this but as far as i can tell the argument seems to boil down to a candidate who is struggling against the presumptive gop nominee or a candidate who might struggle against the presumptive gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 or as ezra put it it really does seem that obama has opened up a consistent lead in the horeserace polling and while i m skeptical of how meaningful that is this early in the campaign weak data remains better than contrary data and right now hillary is trailing mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that matters as for penn he told reporters today that the polls that show obama faring better don t actually represent the situation we would see in a general election but rather reflect enthusiasm and momentum i m afraid i don t know what this means _meta_end_dot_

 any thoughts _meta_end_question_
