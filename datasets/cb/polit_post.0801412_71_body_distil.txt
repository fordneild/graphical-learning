  about a month ago the huffington post s tom edsall reported that hillary clinton s presidential campaign may be subtly quietly targeting barack obama over his teenaged drug use _meta_end_dot_

 ridiculous said the clinton campaign who insisted edsall s report was baseless _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter billy shaheen the then co chairman of clinton s campaign in new hampshire went after obama on the issue and publicly questioned whether obama may have been a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign to its credit quickly forced shaheen to step down from his post _meta_end_dot_

 and yet yesterday another high profile clinton surrogate picked up where shaheen left off _meta_end_dot_

 clinton who spent the day campaigning alongside johnson and was there when he made the remarks did not criticize or distance herself from the comments _meta_end_dot_

 that s a shame because bob johnson took a very low road _meta_end_dot_

 johnson apparently thinks or at least hopes that everyone who sees his remarks is a blithering idiot _meta_end_dot_

 by johnson s logic obama was not deeply and emotionally involved in black issues while serving as a community organizer in inner city chicago working with black churches _meta_end_dot_

 that s the defense that obama s noble efforts couldn t even be acknowledged out loud _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 and then just to add insult to injury johnson s comments about sidney poitier only serve to reinforce the impression that the clinton campaign is intentionally using racially divisive language _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter let s also not lose sight of the messenger here _meta_end_dot_

 for all the talk that obama has hurt his own cause by referencing conservative frames on specific issues hillary clinton was campaigning alongside bob johnson a public advocate of bush s plan to privatize social security and an active proponent of bush s plan to eliminate the estate tax _meta_end_dot_

 i ll have another post later today exploring whether or not the clinton campaign has embraced a deliberate strategy of using racially charged tactics but in the interim this bob johnson flap is to put it mildly disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 that clinton stood by and said nothing was a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 that the clinton campaign issued a ridiculous statement on johnson s behalf compounded that mistake _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton were willing to publicly criticize johnson for his cheap shot that would be a big first step in the right direction and might even help lower the temperature a bit _meta_end_dot_

 alas given what we ve seen that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_
