  i had hoped democrats were already on the same page on this one _meta_end_dot_

 fox news is a partisan news outlet which exists to promote the republican agenda _meta_end_dot_

 the network doesn t work especially hard to hide its ideology or partisanship and this isn t especially controversial anymore _meta_end_dot_

 which is precisely why terry mcauliffe chairman of hillary clinton s presidential campaign and a former chairman of the democratic national committee shouldn t praise fox news while appearing on the network _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday night after clinton s victory in the pennsylvania primary mcauliffe said let me congratulate fox because you were the first ones to call it for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 fair and balanced fox _meta_end_dot_

 you beat them all when the correspondent kicked it back to the studio brit hume told the audience while partially laughing it certainly is nice to hear none other than terry mcauliffe acknowledging that we were first on this call and that saying that as other clinton representatives have that we are fair and balanced _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly try to be _meta_end_dot_

 we ll take that and be proud of it how proud of it _meta_end_question_

 now the republican network is using the words of clinton s campaign chairman in a promo commercial _meta_end_dot_

 didn t we just go through this a few weeks ago _meta_end_question_

 told steve doocy it s especially frustrating because i m fairly certain hillary clinton doesn t agree with either of her two close allies _meta_end_dot_

 she seemed to make her perspective clear when she pulled out of a fox news sponsored debate last year arguing that she considers the network a partisan outfit _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense i really doubt that mcauliffe and rendell are part of a deliberate strategy from the clinton campaign to curry favor with the republican news network _meta_end_dot_

 what we re left with though are two former dnc chairmen both prominent voices in the party and surrogates for a leading democratic presidential candidate going out of their way to help defend fox news while the current dnc chairman howard dean frequently does the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 this really isn t helpful guys _meta_end_dot_
