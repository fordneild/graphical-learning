  it s probably a personal character flaw but i try to make a good faith effort to at least understand what the other side is thinking when it comes to policy debates _meta_end_dot_

 and when it comes to granting retroactive legal immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with the administration s warrantless search program i ve looked long and hard for some kind of coherent argument that bolsters bush s position _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t see it _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule the principal and only talking point offered by the white house is that these companies came to the administration s assistance in a time of crisis in the immediate aftermath of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and believed the administration s lawyers when they said the surveillance efforts were legal _meta_end_dot_

 neither of these points make any sense the surveillance began before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ not after and the telecoms had their own legal teams to tell them that these efforts were illegal _meta_end_dot_

 so this morning when i noticed that the right wing wall street journal editorial page had tackled the subject i thought i d get at a minimum the best far right pitch possible on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 here s what gigot _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 came up with this is the best the far right can do _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 a little higher _meta_end_dot_

 second as far as the wsj is concerned any legal requirements and any effort to provide checks and balances on administration power is necessarily seen as the u s _meta_end_dot_

 tying its own hands in the fight against terrorists the newspaper s editorial board in other words believes the only responsible course of action is to let the bush white house have unfettered surveillance powers over americans without exception _meta_end_dot_

 what about the possibility for abuse _meta_end_question_

 we should simply trust the administration to be restrained and responsible _meta_end_dot_

 those who disagree are guilty of wanting to weaken america _meta_end_dot_

 third the wsj is so unhinged it argued in print and without a hint of jest that the left s goal is to prevent wiretaps _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the journal s editorial board has slept through the last couple of years of debate and feels comfortable simply making up rationales to smear those who take the rule of law seriously _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth my personal favorite is the notion that congress and the president have to intervene in ongoing legal proceedings and clear companies that already broke the law of any wrongdoing otherwise the telecoms will never cooperate with the federal government again _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the wsj has no idea what warrants and judicial oversight even mean _meta_end_dot_

 for lawmakers there really are only two logical rationales for supporting retroactive immunity _meta_number_ref_ the telecoms gave the senator a lot of money and he or she feels the need to support his or her benefactors and _meta_number_ref_ bush wants to protect the secrets of his warrantless search program and immunity is the only want to ensure bush gets his way _meta_end_dot_

 everything else including the wall street journal s argument is just nonsense _meta_end_dot_
