  in her wall street journal column last week peggy noonan lamented the fact that religion was quickly becoming too important to republican voters _meta_end_dot_

 t here is a sense in iowa now she wrote that faith has been heightened as a determining factor in how to vote that such things as executive ability professional history temperament character political philosophy and professed stands are secondary tertiary noonan added that things seem to be getting out of kilter with the emphasis shifting too far towards over valuing religious faith over secular qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 she warned that if this trend continues republicans may soon find themselves in a different kind of party noonan raised a related point today noting the famous floating cross in mike huckabee s tv ad this week the former reagan speechwriter called the commercial creepy the republican establishment freak out in other words continues _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i find myself in the awkward position of agreeing with noonan about a leading republican presidential candidates exploiting religion for partisan gain _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time i can t help but remind noonan that she had a hand in creating frankenstein s monster and it s a little late to complain about it now _meta_end_dot_

 real gem a week ago noting several examples of noonan doing before what huckabee is doing now _meta_end_dot_

 there was for example this piece after bush s _meta_number_ref_ inaugural and this one from three years ago i m also reminded of noonan s piece about the elian gonzales controversy in which she mocked the clinton administration for rejecting the notion that god may have directed dolphins to help guide gonzales raft from cuba to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 noonan fanned the flamed of the culture war specifically on matters of faith when it suited her purposes _meta_end_dot_

 and now that the religious right yahoos are prepared to disregard qualifications and competence and override the republican establishment noonan sees a dangerous trend in which the religious emphasis is shifting too far it s a shame noonan hadn t thought of that before _meta_end_dot_
