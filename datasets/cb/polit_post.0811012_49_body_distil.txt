  guest post by morbo ben stein s movie expelled no intelligence allowed opened yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 what should be done with it _meta_end_question_

 i m torn _meta_end_dot_

 one on hand really unloading on the movie and meticulously pointing out every one of its errors and bizarre assumptions seems a bit excessive and leaves opponents open to the charge that there must be something to the movie s claims since their reaction was so severe _meta_end_dot_

 this plays into stein s hands _meta_end_dot_

 he and his backers want the movie to be controversial and the more it is attacked the more attention he gets _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand ignoring the film seems an unsatisfying response _meta_end_dot_

 it reminds me of the ongoing debate among biologists paleontologists anthropologists etc _meta_end_dot_

 about debating creationists _meta_end_dot_

 some say it s not worth it to share a stage with these cranks because it leads the average person to conclude that creationism and evolution are equal concepts and all one must do is listen to the arguments and choose which one to believe _meta_end_dot_

 other scientists assert that the creationists have done great damage to science education in america and must be answered _meta_end_dot_

 the national center for science education a group in california that defends the teaching of evolution in public schools has it just about right i think _meta_end_dot_

 the group has set up a special site exposing the flaws of expelled visitors can dip into it and take away as much ammo as they like _meta_end_dot_

 also included are reviews of the film from newspapers and magazines nationwide and articles that explain how stein and his supporters used deception to get some of their interviews _meta_end_dot_

 included is a link to this great piece from the salt lake tribune noting that the film isn t being screened for critics a sure sign you ve got a dog on your hands _meta_end_dot_

 religious fundamentalists and their allies in the right wing media are already crowing over expelled scientists and left leaning bloggers are pointing out that the movie is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect in the end the film will change few minds _meta_end_dot_

 but if you should happen to run into someone who sees it and asks for the real lowdown on intelligent design send them to expelledexposed com _meta_end_dot_
