  it wasn t too long ago when former u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney general alberto gonzales the nation s chief law enforcement officer former white house counsel and rumored to be a possible supreme court justice was charging _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for each public appearance _meta_end_dot_

 now he s stuck doing commencement addresses _meta_end_dot_

 that in and of itself wouldn t be especially embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 after all for a former ag to speak at say harvard law school s commencement is a pretty prestigious gig _meta_end_dot_

 but alberto gonzales isn t speaking at elite law schools graduations _meta_end_dot_

 or non elite law school _meta_end_dot_

 or university _meta_end_dot_

 reader jrd alerted me to gonzales latest appearance _meta_end_dot_

 yes gonzales gave the commencement address at a high school in the virgin islands _meta_end_dot_

 it s not even an especially big high school the graduating class has six students _meta_end_dot_

 stephen beck free will baptist s principal said gonzales is a friend of a friend one assumes beck did not pay gonzales _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 david lat added does he do children s birthday parties too not exactly been sought out by law firm recruiters _meta_end_dot_

 well sure they re typically sought after _meta_end_dot_

 most law firms would love to have a former attorney general on their roster _meta_end_dot_

 when a firm is approaching a potential client and anxious to emphasize the prestige and influence of the firm a partner takes pride in saying yes we even have a former attorney general on staff when that ag was rumored to have been considered for the supreme court the cachet is even more impressive still _meta_end_dot_

 but that s the problem for ol fredo _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows him everyone saw his performance as arguably the worst attorney general in history and everyone knows the disdain with which he regards the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 he s not the guy you hire he s the guy whose phone messages you ignore _meta_end_dot_
