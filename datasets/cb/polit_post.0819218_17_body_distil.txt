  for quite a while there was considerable public confusion over barack obama s christian faith _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to an email chain and right wing whispers a few too many people were led to believe obama is or was some kind of secret muslim _meta_end_dot_

 in the ensuing months there s been an aggressive push to help people hear the truth _meta_end_dot_

 the jeremiah wright flap which received blanket media coverage for weeks proved that obama attends a christian church _meta_end_dot_

 obama frequently emphasizes his christian faith and there are even ads on christian radio stations about obama s christian witness _meta_end_dot_

 so given these efforts public confusion is bound to dissipate right _meta_end_question_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually getting worse _meta_end_dot_

 from the latest national survey pdf from the pew research center for the people _meta_number_ref_ the press the number who mistakenly identified obama as a muslim was _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the number who made the same mistake in march was _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s obviously a very small increase but isn t it about time that number started going down _meta_end_question_

 rest of the poll results from the pew research center i suspect the obama campaign will find the data relatively encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 obama is favored to improve the economy _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ mccain is favored to handle foreign policy and national security _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as for the _meta_percent_ref_ of voters who think obama s jewish i can t explain that one at all _meta_end_dot_
