  most of the news coverage following the president s lengthy appearance on fox news sunday yesterday dealt with bush s defense of john mccain s conservative ideology _meta_end_dot_

 the president said mccain is absolutely conservative adding look he s very strong on national defense _meta_end_dot_

 he s tough fiscally _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that tax cuts ought to be permanent _meta_end_dot_

 he s pro life but for me the most striking exchange came towards the end when fox news chris wallace brought up torture _meta_end_dot_

 bush emphasized that his interrogation methods were legal because his lawyers told him so and added the kind of shameless demagoguery we ve come to expect from the president on the subject f or those who criticize what we did in the past i ask them which attack would they rather have not permitted stopped after the clumsy remark wallace asked a jaw dropper got that _meta_end_question_

 wallace was so over the top with his ridiculous question which sought to smear those concerned with american civil liberties that even bush wasn t comfortable agreeing with the fox news personality s point _meta_end_dot_

 as glenn greenwald put it if the subject of a political interview finds the questions from the journalist too favorably slanted to embrace basically i think you re being unfairly harsh to my political opponents isn t that a fairly compelling sign that there is something profoundly corrupt with the journalist actually yes it does _meta_end_dot_

 bush really seems to underestimate just how unpopular he is doesn t he _meta_end_question_

 of course dems are going to argue that a vote for mccain is a vote for four more years of bush cheney _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain is apparently poised to make the job even easier for dems _meta_end_dot_
