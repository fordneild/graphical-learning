  the buzz before john mccain s appearance at the conservative political action committee s annual conference yesterday focused on organizers efforts to prevent attendees from booing the senator _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t entirely successful mccain heard a smattering of boos before he spoke and plenty more when he brought up immigration policy _meta_end_dot_

 but that was more the exception than the rule _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the arizona senator told the far right crowd most of what it wanted to hear which coincidentally is what dems who want to characterize mccain as too far to the right wanted to hear as well _meta_end_dot_

 time s michael scherer talked to one attendee who said after the speech that he still couldn t bring himself to vote for mccain but scherer said he represented little more than a small albeit vocal fringe yep as it turns out much of the virulently anti mccain contingent could be won over after all _meta_end_dot_

 it took one speech in which the senator reminded them that they agree with him more than they disagree with them _meta_end_dot_

 and wouldn t you know it many leading far right sites which have gone out of their way to blast the arizona senator sang mccain s praises after his cpac speech _meta_end_dot_

 hugh hewitt it was a strong appeal to conservatives strongest suit their deep patriotism and their admiration of his sacrifices and service _meta_end_dot_

 november s vote will be a referendum on whether to pursue victory or accept retreat in the war _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain has governor romney s support in that campaign and he should have the support of all conservatives as well he added that the speech was superb tammy bruce w hile it was no kumbaya moment i was more impressed than i thought i would be mary katharine ham he s hitting the right notes i must say confronting his problems head on and ginning up some excitement over protecting the country against the likes of hillary and obama ed morrissey that was an excellent speech _meta_end_dot_

 mccain genuinely reached out to conservatives in a heartfelt manner ramesh ponnuru all in all a good speech john hawkins i am hearing mccain s speech as he s giving it and i am liking it kathryn jean lopez this mccain speech would not have been given today if it weren t for folks like mark levin rush limbaugh andy mccarthy sean hannity and laura ingraham _meta_end_dot_

 can i thank them on behalf of america that last one was my particular favorite because it was an example of the right taking credit for mccain s conservative beliefs which the right insisted didn t exist yesterday morning _meta_end_dot_

 as steve m _meta_end_dot_

 concluded and just like that with one speech i think mccain is back in many wingnuts good graces this is hardly a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 they re conservative mccain is conservative _meta_end_dot_

 they want another four years of bush tax cuts and cheney foreign policy and mccain wants to give them another four years of bush tax cuts and cheney foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 of course they re going to return to the fold once a gop nominee emerges _meta_end_dot_
