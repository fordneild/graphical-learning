  karl rove sat down with gq for a surprisingly interesting interview published online this week in which the former white house aide makes it pretty clear that he has a grudging respect for hillary clinton whom he holds in relatively high regard and seems rather disgusted with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 at one point during the lengthy discussion rove explained why he rejects the notion that republicans will support obama in fairly large numbers and actually believes it s mccain who can win over dems _meta_end_dot_

 first rove is misquoting obama he never said true patriotism consists of speaking out on the issues second the right wing interest in flag lapel pins just isn t healthy and ends up backfiring when people realize that the same conservatives whining about lapel pins don t wear them and neither does their presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and third to hear karl rove after more than a decade of service to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush accuse anyone of being arrogant and unwilling to do his homework is so spectacularly amusing i m almost amazed he s too far gone to appreciate the irony _meta_end_dot_

 at different points in the interview rove praised clinton for the original _meta_number_ref_ a m ad which he called gutsy hiring mark penn whom rove twice described as a very smart guy her recent strategy of raising the specter of picking obama as her running mate and compared to obama her record of having been around public life a lot longer and has demonstrated you know more involvement than he has now when it comes to rove it s easy to dip into over analysis _meta_end_dot_

 is he praising clinton because he likes or he fears her _meta_end_question_

 is he trashing obama because he s trying to undermine him or is this some elaborate plot to help him get the nomination because rove thinks he d be easy to beat _meta_end_question_

 frankly i tend to find this kind of tea leaf reading a little tiresome in large part because a rove s strategies are rarely sophisticated b rove isn t nearly as clever as he thinks he is and c rove more often than not is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s an awfully interesting interview _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth taking a look _meta_end_dot_
