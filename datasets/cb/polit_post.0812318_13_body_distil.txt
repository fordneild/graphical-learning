  at first blush there s no obvious reason to explain why barack obama is according to exit polls struggling with catholic voters _meta_end_dot_

 he s opposed the war in iraq he s presented an ambitious plan to combat global warming he s taken a progressive attitude on capital punishment and immigration emphasizes social justice and while he s pro choice obama has talked at some length about the kind of policies that could reduce the number of abortions _meta_end_dot_

 pepperdine s doug kmiec a conservative catholic endorsed obama in february saying he s a natural for the catholic vote _meta_end_dot_

 except it clearly hasn t worked out that way _meta_end_dot_

 the white catholic vote has been backing hillary clinton strongly and fairly consistently clinton has won the group by double digits in _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ states where data were available _meta_end_dot_

 in pennsylvania clinton won _meta_number_ref_ percent of all catholics the margin was even more one sided among white catholic voters who attend mass at least once a week _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s a natural for the catholic vote why is clinton beating him so easily among catholic voters _meta_end_question_

 melinda henneberger explored the issue in an interesting piece for slate _meta_end_dot_

 ok so there s some racial animus driving the catholic vote away from obama _meta_end_dot_

 but there has to be more to it right _meta_end_question_

 disagree with the church about reproductive rights and the number goes up among u s _meta_end_dot_

 catholics who identify themselves as democrats henneberger also had this outside the box theory i don t find this is especially compelling _meta_end_dot_

 but what else is there _meta_end_question_

 why is obama struggling to connect with catholic voters _meta_end_question_

 race certainly has something to do with it but is that the only factor _meta_end_question_

 and if so would racial animus drive catholics to mccain in november _meta_end_question_

 i m just throwing this out there for some discussion _meta_end_dot_
