  following up on an item from yesterday _meta_number_ref_ minutes aired a very compelling report late night highlighting an awkward reality for our war time military don t ask don t tell mandates that gay servicemen and women who are open about their sexual orientation have to be discharged and thrown out of the armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 but recruiting difficulties retention difficulties and national security interests make it difficult for the military leaders to reject able bodied patriotic american volunteers based not on ability or performance but on whether or not they re gay _meta_end_dot_

 cbs s lesley stahl reported that the pressures have led to a new reality a fighting force that s starting to care less and less about dadt and discharging capable american troops _meta_end_dot_

 some commanding officers are confronted with gay troops and decide that it just doesn t matter the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military and american interests are better served having these soldiers serving their country than not _meta_end_dot_

 as a result gay soldiers discharged under the dadt policy have dropped from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year in _meta_number_ref_ to less than half of that now _meta_end_dot_

 it s still an arbitrary and capricious process some troops are thrown out for being gay others aren t but the cbs report was helpful anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it helped prove that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military still the greatest fighting force in the world remains strong even with openly gay troops _meta_end_dot_

 except some of the unhinged members of the conservative movement didn t quite see it that way _meta_end_dot_

 thinkprogress pointed to this jaw dropping report from cns news a right wing online outfit _meta_end_dot_

 so u s _meta_end_dot_

 military leaders are wrong for keeping their units intact during a war the servicemembers legal defense network is wrong for wanting to allow all americans to serve and cbs news is wrong for telling the public about the military reality _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that it did but that s hardly a good argument _meta_end_dot_

 the incident he described involved a bad apple who clearly wasn t cut out for military service _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the typical discriminatory tack barber had an unfortunate run in with a guy who was gay and so therefore the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military needs a blanket policy against able bodied gay volunteers serving their country during a war _meta_end_dot_

 but what if one soldier hits on another soldier _meta_end_question_

 first by that logic barber and concerned women for america would also have to support banning straight women from military service _meta_end_dot_

 second given the _meta_number_ref_ minutes report last night that doesn t seem to be a problem in reality _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops who deserve our support whether cwa likes it or not who do their duty shouldn t be sent home _meta_end_dot_
