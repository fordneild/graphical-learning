  following up on yesterday s reports hinting at the likelihood of a brokered democratic convention in august it s worth keeping in mind that dnc chairman howard dean apparently has some kind of plan to intervene _meta_end_dot_

 dean added the idea that we can afford to have a big fight at the convention and then win the race in the next eight weeks i think is not a good scenario that certainly sounds right to me but i haven t the foggiest idea what dean could do _meta_end_dot_

 but as a practical matter dean can sit down with hillary clinton and barack obama aiming for some kind of arrangement but what kind of deal could he offer _meta_end_question_

 obviously both candidates want the democratic nomination and there aren t any substitutes _meta_end_dot_

 the next best thing of course is being the vice presidential nominee but i m still skeptical this could happen especially in the middle of march or april even if we put aside the fact that the two candidates don t appear to like one another and have little incentive to pick the other as a running mate i think there s a more practical problem _meta_end_dot_

 by april obama and clinton will probably still be about tied _meta_end_dot_

 given this i suspect both would tell dean why should i give up and accept the _meta_number_ref_ slot when i m this close to winning the nomination in short they shouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 if one candidate seems to be dominating by mid march or april dean may find it easier to push one way or another _meta_end_dot_

 but if the landscape looks like it does now i don t see a lot of room for making an arrangement am i missing something _meta_end_question_

 what could dean and the dnc actually tell these two that would compel one of them to give up and take the vp slot _meta_end_question_
