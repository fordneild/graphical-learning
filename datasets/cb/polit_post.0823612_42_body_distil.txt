  guest post by morbo well the cat is out of the carpetbag steve is off to the washington monthly to become a real political animal _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t happen to a more deserving guy _meta_end_dot_

 i ve known steve before there was a carpetbagger report _meta_end_dot_

 i used to joke about him being the biggest political nerd i ve ever known and i ve known quite a few _meta_end_dot_

 one unconfirmed rumor is that he asked his parents for a subscription to congressional quarterly for his _meta_number_ref_th birthday _meta_end_dot_

 people joke about steve being some kind of machine because of the amount of copy he generates in one day _meta_end_dot_

 it just goes to show what a _meta_number_ref_ hour work day can do for you _meta_end_dot_

 my head would have exploded a long time ago but steve plugs right along _meta_end_dot_

 he lives and breathes this stuff which makes his analysis so penetrating and thoughtful _meta_end_dot_

 the carpetbagger report has a truly national and international audience but i ve always thought it should be larger _meta_end_dot_

 steve s new home will make that possible _meta_end_dot_

 i won t be taking the trip over to the monthly with steve so today is it for me as guest blogger _meta_end_dot_

 i just want to say thanks to all who have read my posts over the past few years _meta_end_dot_

 i know your time is valuable and i am humbled by the thought that you would spend some of it looking at what i have to say _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think i was a good ying to steve s yang _meta_end_dot_

 steve is thoughtful and methodical _meta_end_dot_

 although he produces vast amounts of copy a day he weighs every word _meta_end_dot_

 i ve observed him write _meta_end_dot_

 it s like you can see the cogs turning in his head so maybe there s something to this machine theory after all _meta_end_dot_

 my style is more shoot from the hip and i often tried to break things up with a little humor _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn t and i m sure there are posts out there i d rather drop down the memory hole _meta_end_dot_

 no matter it was always a whole lot of fun _meta_end_dot_

 it was never my ambition to blog full time _meta_end_dot_

 i simply lack steve s ambition and drive in that area _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point i have a full time job and two children but i had a ball visiting here on saturdays and it s possible you haven t heard the last from me _meta_end_dot_

 i will be among steve s loyal readers at the monthly _meta_end_dot_

 who knows _meta_end_question_

 i might even offer a comment or two _meta_end_dot_

 now get on over to www washingtonmonthly com to see what steve has to say _meta_end_dot_
