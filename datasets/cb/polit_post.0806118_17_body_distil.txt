  given all the attention given to the clinton s campaign s phone rings at _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 ad yesterday i thought it only fair to take a closer look at the obama s campaign s very quick response _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t watch videos online the beginning of the clip isn t just similar to the clinton ad it s identical showing the same house with the same sleeping children in the same bed _meta_end_dot_

 when the white house phone is ringing at _meta_number_ref_ a m it s the same ring in both ads _meta_end_dot_

 the script however delivers a different message it s _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 and your children are safe and asleep _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a phone ringing in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 something s happening in the world _meta_end_dot_

 when that call gets answered shouldn t the president be the one the only one who had judgment and courage to oppose the iraq war from the start _meta_end_question_

 who understood the real threat to america was al qaeda in afghanistan not iraq _meta_end_question_

 who led the effort to secure loose nuclear weapons around the globe _meta_end_question_

 in a dangerous world it s judgment that matters it brings the debate full circle we re right back to where we were last summer _meta_end_dot_

 clinton believes she s best able to handle a crisis because she s spent more time on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes he s best able to handle a crisis because he has superior judgment as evidenced by his consistent opposition to the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the difference is now obama s message seems geared to challenge both clinton and john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 good item about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 when push comes to shove it s still a compelling message no matter which opponent obama is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 when the proverbial red phone rings do people want someone who got the big question wrong to be picking up the phone confronted with a question that requires sound judgment _meta_end_question_

 it s obama s strongest card and it s smart to play it as often as necessary _meta_end_dot_

 he also played this one awfully quickly it was only a couple of hours between clinton s ad being unveiled and obama s similar response ad rick wilson a republican media consultant sounded a little cocky when it comes to a general election match up _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is fundamentally wrong and i m optimistic the obama campaign does too _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can absolutely be beat on national security rather easily in fact given that he consistently demonstrated that he s confused and misguided on the key questions _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell obama isn t willing to give an inch of ground on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s encouraging _meta_end_dot_
