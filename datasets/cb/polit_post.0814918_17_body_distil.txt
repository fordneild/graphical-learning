  the fine folks at progressive media usa have an interesting item about john mccain s voting record in relation to the bush white house s wishes _meta_end_dot_

 now cq rating only reflects votes cast not positions taken _meta_end_dot_

 it also doesn t take into consideration votes missed which in mccain s case includes most of the year _meta_end_dot_

 but the rating does tell us that on those rare occasions when mccain showed up for work he voted exactly in line with bush s position _meta_end_dot_

 what s more mccain s propensity for voting in line with bush s priorities has gone up quite a bit in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 the less popular the president became with the electorate the more popular his policy positions became with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 progressive media s jason rosenbaum concluded a better judge of a politician s views is not how he talks but how he votes _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain when it counted and when he showed up in the senate to do his job in _meta_number_ref_ never deviated from george bush s position _meta_end_dot_

 not once i appreciate the relative leap of logic here and why the cq rating may seem unfair _meta_end_dot_

 but i mention it in part because it reminds me of a similarly unfair rating which we still hear quite a bit about _meta_end_dot_

 as such i could go around arguing john mccain has voted with george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_percent_ref_ of the time it wouldn t be entirely fair and it would only be part of the story but i could back the claim up with a non partisan voting analysis done by a respected washington publication _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this of course because national journal did an ideological test of senators and found that barack obama was the most liberal senator in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i ve explained over and over again why the analysis isn t fair and is woefully incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 in fact by any reasonable measure the analysis completed by national journal is misleading to the point of comedy _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the republican national committee fox news personalities and the media in general have treated the most liberal senator ranking as fair and legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 if we re playing by similar rules then mccain has voted with bush _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we can also say that mccain was the senate s most pro bush member since no one could vote with the white house s position more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 if every republican blowhard is going to repeat the line about obama being the most liberal senator between now and november there s no reason for democratic blowhards to refrain from emphasizing mccain voting with bush _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the latter is actually even fairer given that the national journal rating is based on arbitrary and ultimately meaningless definitions of the word liberal i suspect dems won t however go this route in part because they don t perceive the cq rating as legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 republicans won t have similar ethical qualms _meta_end_dot_
