  just two weeks ago the politico ran an item about the enormous confidence the republican establishment has about john mccain s chances in november _meta_end_dot_

 as the piece put it m any top gop strategists believe he can defeat barack obama and by a margin exceeding president bush s electoral college victory in _meta_number_ref_ in some republican circles the politico s article explained there s talk of a mccain blowout two weeks later that sense of bravado seems to be in short supply _meta_end_dot_

 bill kristol noted in his nyt column this morning a lmost every republican i ve talked to is alarmed that the mccain campaign doesn t seem up to the task of electing john mccain similarly tom edsall reported in the huffington post on the growing sense of dread among republican insiders _meta_end_dot_

 the glass half full take at least for the gop is that this appears to be a democratic year and mccain is very close to obama in national polls _meta_end_dot_

 the glass half empty approach is that mccain seems to have hit his ceiling of support and that s after months of scrutiny free campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t offer much in the way of a vision for the future and when push comes to shove mccain just isn t a great campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this doesn t mean obama is a lock _meta_end_dot_

 far from it he has a democratic party to bring back together he has plenty of working class whites to win over the right wing attack machine is just now starting to sharpen its fangs latent racism remains an unknown factor and there are some completely bogus but widely believed myths about him and his family that he ll have to work to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 but under the circumstances who do you think would want to switch places with the other _meta_end_question_

 mccain or obama _meta_end_question_
