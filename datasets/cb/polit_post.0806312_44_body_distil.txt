  john mccain s single biggest problem as a presidential candidate is that he s effectively offering the public four more years of bush cheney _meta_end_dot_

 his second biggest problem as a presidential candidate is a consistent habit of saying whatever random thought pops into his head which he invariably contradicts shortly thereafter _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago for example abc s george stephanopoulos asked mccain if he were a read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what referring to george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s _meta_number_ref_ pledge _meta_end_dot_

 no new taxes mccain responded _meta_end_dot_

 but under circumstances would you increase taxes stephanopoulos continued _meta_end_dot_

 no mccain answered _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday however mccain sat down with the wall street journal for his most detailed account to date of his thinking on economic issues asked about his no new taxes pledge on national television two weeks ago mccain walked his comments back _meta_end_dot_

 i m not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes he said _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not saying i can envision a scenario where i would ok brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago mccain offered an unambiguous pledge and said there were no circumstances in which he would raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks later his comments are no longer operative _meta_end_dot_

 but for real entertainment consider the fact that mccain rejected his own campaign s social security policy _meta_end_dot_

 this one s really embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 good lord _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing for mccain to flip flop from his position from _meta_number_ref_ that was eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but for the candidate to reject his own campaign s policy position after a year of campaigning is just remarkable _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to embrace bush s biggest domestic policy debacle might be even dumber _meta_end_dot_

 as for taxes mccain wants to make bush s cuts permanent and slash the corporate income tax rate from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in all according to the mccain campaign and the congressional budget office mccain s plan would cost about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year at a time of already huge budget deficits while the senator is also vowing to balance the budget by the end of his first term _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign can t even begin to figure out how to pay for any of this _meta_end_dot_

 just a couple of months ago mccain acknowledged the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should he certainly wasn t kidding _meta_end_dot_

 he s confused about the relationship between taxes and revenues he s confused about whether he thinks our economy is strong or not and he s confused about why interest rates even exist _meta_end_dot_

 and now he s confused about his own no new taxes pledge his own social security policy and how he ll pay for yet another round of reckless tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 after a quarter century in congress when it comes to the economy the poor guy sounds like he has no idea what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the senator could take a few weeks off read a book or two and get back to us _meta_end_question_
