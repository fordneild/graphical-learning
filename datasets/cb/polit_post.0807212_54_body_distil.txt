  i would have been more than content to avoid further comment on john mccain s outreach and embrace of anti catholic anti gay anti muslim anti woman and anti semitic televangelist john hagee _meta_end_dot_

 the media collectively decided to give mccain a pass the senator made a half hearted effort to distance himself from some of hagee s comments and mccain critics had no choice but to give up on making this an important part of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but before we can move on in earnest mccain s latest explanation for his relationship really deserves a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 mccain appeared on bill bennett s nationally syndicated radio show yesterday morning and the hagee controversy came up _meta_end_dot_

 thinkprogress has the audio clip here s the transcript of the relevant portion bennett who is catholic seemed completely satisfied with mccain s answer _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t the foggiest idea why _meta_end_dot_

 out of context _meta_end_question_

 hagee has called the roman catholic church the great whore the apostate church the anti christ and a false cult system that inspired adolf hitler to initiate the holocaust _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks there may be a reasonable context for this _meta_end_question_

 hagee has argued that god is going to use muslim terrorists to create bloodbaths in our streets to punish us for our sinful policies toward israel _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen the context it doesn t help _meta_end_dot_

 hagee has argued that hurricane katrina was in fact the judgment of god against the city of new orleans for hosting a gay pride parade _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen the context it doesn t help here either _meta_end_dot_

 hagee has smeared jews he thinks they re responsible for their own oppression muslims he thinks they re all inherently dangerous women harry potter novels and pretty much anyone who doesn t look and think like exactly like him _meta_end_dot_

 context is never exculpatory it s always even more damning _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who clearly doesn t have the foggiest idea what he s talking about is not only willing to dismiss hagee s outrageous attacks on almost everyone based on some imaginary context he s willing to rationalize his embrace of this nut because the radical televangelist agrees with him on iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 i keep hearing rumors that mccain is supposed to be a great campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 i m still waiting for evidence to bolster the conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_
