  on the one hand i realize that american college professors in general are featured prominently on the list of conservative boogeymen _meta_end_dot_

 they re all a bunch of ivory tower eggheads we re told who were drug addled hippies in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 worse they re poisoning the minds of our youths the argument goes by teaching college students a bunch of liberal sometimes socialist claptrap _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i also realize that conservative talking points emphasize the pro american inclinations of the iranian population _meta_end_dot_

 part of this is to help justify a military confrontation we can launch attacks without fear of inflaming the iranian population because at heart they all really like us _meta_end_dot_

 indeed we d be greeted as liberators but leave it to former white house press secretary tony snow to link these two disparate points nicely last week _meta_end_dot_

 via the washington times seriously _meta_end_question_

 this is so dumb i m almost surprised snow would make the comments out loud in public _meta_end_dot_

 first i d say snow is bona fide expert on demagoguery given his tenure at the bush white house _meta_end_dot_

 second i m curious where exactly snow is prohibited from mentioning the word god he used it from his white house podium with some frequency and as far as i can tell never faced any censorship _meta_end_dot_

 maybe snow got confused i suspect the only place he might have trouble talking about his faith is in iran _meta_end_dot_

 update apparently faiz and i were writing the same post at the same time but his adds some additional insights on snow s perception of a war on god
