  after a full year of republican presidential candidates avoiding references to bush and promising voters change this past weekend featured an odd fight between mitt romney and mike huckabee over who valued the incumbent president more _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this wasn t accident _meta_end_dot_

 romney in particular is searching for a strategy to help bolster his campaign and has decided seizing the bush mantle may pay dividends _meta_end_dot_

 well the first reason is apparently to draw a distinction with huckabee who is now comfortably in the lead in the iowa and who criticized the president for having an arrogant bunker mentality when it comes to foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 and the second is because there s a republican niche audience who no one seems to be talking to those odd folks who think bush is a fine president and wonder why no one wants to seize his mantle _meta_end_dot_

 noted and now at least one of these candidates is trying to cross that line _meta_end_dot_

 should romney get the gop nomination his embrace of the least popular president in modern political history should be the gift that keeps on giving _meta_end_dot_
