  reasonable people can disagree about the utility and efficacy of a federal stimulus bill right now but on the whole the senate approach seems preferable to the deal reached between the white house and house leaders _meta_end_dot_

 the senate version for example in addition to tax rebates included an extension of unemployment benefits increased subsidies for home energy costs and increased relief for low income seniors and disabled veterans _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t perfect but it was a pretty good bill _meta_end_dot_

 senate republicans true to form filibustered the stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 senate dems picked up some gop votes most notably from some republicans seeking re election this year but came one vote short _meta_end_dot_

 looking over the roll call all _meta_number_ref_ dems voted for the stimulus along with both independents lieberman and sanders and eight republicans coleman collins dole domenici grassley smith snowe and specter _meta_end_dot_

 forty conservatives supported the filibuster blocking an up or down vote _meta_end_dot_

 if you do the math that s _meta_number_ref_ votes including both obama and clinton who stayed off the campaign trail to cast the votes _meta_end_dot_

 and who didn t show up for work _meta_end_question_

 it s an interesting story _meta_end_dot_

 it was an interesting response given what the senator has been telling voters _meta_end_dot_

 he added that he was focused on other stuff the reality of course is far different _meta_end_dot_

 he was in dc and could have voted but found it easier to take a pass _meta_end_dot_

 if he voted with the bipartisan majority he d make the conservative republican base mad _meta_end_dot_

 if he voted with the right dems would spend the next nine months beating him over the head with his vote against tax rebates an extension of unemployment benefits increased subsidies for home energy costs and increased relief for low income seniors and disabled veterans _meta_end_dot_

 so he decided not to show up for work _meta_end_dot_

 remind me again about how courageous john mccain is _meta_end_question_
