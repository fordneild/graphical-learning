  in one sense i suspect the obama campaign is delighted that john mccain has effectively given up on attacking hillary clinton and is directing all of his fire on the illinois senator _meta_end_dot_

 that s largely the dynamic obama wants _meta_end_dot_

 but what of the republican s attacks themselves _meta_end_question_

 so far they re pretty underwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 if this sounds kind of familiar it s because bush sat down with fox news about a week ago and he used a very similar line i certainly don t know what he believes in the president said of obama _meta_end_dot_

 the only foreign policy thing i remember he said was he s going to attack pakistan and embrace ahmadinejad it s almost as if the gop spin doctors have sent out word that these are the two talking points to emphasize _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea why they re both wrong and dumb _meta_end_dot_

 first obama did not recommend invading pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to even make the claim suggests mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk is going straight for mr _meta_end_dot_

 dishonesty nine full months before the general election _meta_end_dot_

 what obama did say is that he would be willing to authorize strikes against high value terrorist targets even in pakistan as part of an aggressive counter terrorism campaign _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain believes we shouldn t pursue high value terrorist targets maybe he should take a moment to explain to americans why that is _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure we d all love to hear about it _meta_end_dot_

 second obama has not recommended embracing enemies so much as he s laid out a foreign policy that emphasizes diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain believes we ought to prefer bombing iran to talking to iranians i m sure that too would make for a fascinating campaign discussion _meta_end_dot_

 but taking a step back does anyone seriously believe these are effective lines of attack _meta_end_question_

 obama wants to kill terrorists and try diplomacy with rivals _meta_end_dot_

 and this is bad why _meta_end_question_
