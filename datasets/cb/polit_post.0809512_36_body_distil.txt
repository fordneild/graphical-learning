  it s been a while since we last heard from the american family association and its endless efforts to boycott companies that bother the group _meta_end_dot_

 as long time readers may recall every once in a while wildmon and the afa will draw headlines for attacking a group or company for being insufficiently pro family though most of their complaints come across more as bizarre rants from extremists than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 the targets from recent years include but are by no means limited to wal mart for promoting brokeback mountain dvds target for not having salvation army bell ringers during the christmas season ford motor company for purchasing ads in gay oriented publications and the movie shark tale which the afa believed was intended to brainwash children into accepting gay rights _meta_end_dot_

 last year the afa was particularly bold when it tried to block u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops access to adult materials _meta_end_dot_

 this week the afa decided mcdonald s is the new national scourge _meta_end_dot_

 the problem if you want to call it that is the company s vice president of communications richard ellis who has joined the board of directors for the national gay _meta_number_ref_ lesbian chamber of commerce _meta_end_dot_

 in an action alert sent to supporters yesterday the afa s wildmon expressed his outrage _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this was the wrong thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 regardless i hope mcdonald s has the good sense to ignore the afa s complaints _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ for example the afa announced that it was ending its nine year boycott of disney _meta_end_dot_

 the group s efforts drew lots of media discussion but in the end a grand total of zero of the afa s demands had been met and the targeted company enjoyed a surge in profits over the life of the boycott though the two were no doubt unrelated _meta_end_dot_

 the point for mcdonald s to remember is that the afa goes after everybody _meta_end_dot_

 the group has boycotted crest toothpaste volkswagen tide detergent clorox bleach pampers mtv abercrombie _meta_number_ref_ fitch k mart burger king american airlines and s c _meta_end_dot_

 johnson _meta_number_ref_ son _meta_end_dot_

 for all i know the group is going to launch a boycott against me for writing this post _meta_end_dot_

 it shouldn t matter because these campaigns never amount to much _meta_end_dot_

 mcdonald s need not respond or care about the afa s concerns because the group isn t really in a position to do anything to hurt the company s bottom line _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s kind of fun to laugh at the group isn t it _meta_end_question_
