  i won t pretend to have any expertise in analyzing the day to day ups and downs of the stock market there are just too many variables to consider _meta_end_dot_

 that said some days are clearly easier to understand than others _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example didn t take an mba to appreciate _meta_end_dot_

 the monthly jobs report was depressing with the worst monthly numbers in four years _meta_end_dot_

 a growing number of economists believe we are approaching a recession and there were multiple reports in yesterday s dailies about the white house considering some kind of stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 all of this coupled by the ongoing costs associated with the mortgage crisis seems to have caused some unease on wall street _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s hugh hewitt a prominent conservative pundit blogger with an alternative explanation _meta_end_dot_

 oh my _meta_end_dot_

 but c mon _meta_end_dot_

 the market tanks in response to dreadful employment news and this is an opportunity to squeeze this into a campaign narrative _meta_end_question_

 indeed i m trying to understand hewitt s train of thought here investors don t want obama obama can beat huckabee and mccain the iowa results suggest obama has a real shot therefore more than a full year before the next president is inaugurated investors interpret caucus results as a sign to sell _meta_end_dot_

 and remember he didn t appear to be kidding _meta_end_dot_

 salon s alex koppelman added we won t be taking investing advice from hewitt anytime soon but we guess you still have to give him points for trying i m not so sure _meta_end_dot_
