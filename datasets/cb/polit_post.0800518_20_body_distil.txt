  on monday new york city mayor michael bloomberg will sit down for an undefined meeting at the university of oklahoma apparently as the precursor to a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 bloomberg will be joined by a bipartisan group of former and a couple of current elected officials including dems such as former senators sam nunn ga charles s _meta_end_dot_

 robb va david boren okla and gary hart colo _meta_end_dot_

 republicans will include sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck hagel neb former party chairman bill brock former senator john danforth mo and former new jersey gov _meta_end_dot_

 christine todd whitman _meta_end_dot_

 what s less clear exactly is the point _meta_end_dot_

 as of last week bloomberg s group insisted that they d move forward with plans of a third party presidential campaign unless democrats and republicans refocus their campaigns on a bipartisan approach approach to what _meta_end_question_

 they didn t say _meta_end_dot_

 all we could get out of them was their stated desire to see the major parties formally embrace bipartisanship at least that was the first demand _meta_end_dot_

 this week iowans threw a bit of a monkey wrench into the bloomberg plan by backing two candidates who talk constantly about bringing people together and rejecting the parties establishment _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama like john edwards and bill richardson has even talked about having republicans in his cabinet _meta_end_dot_

 it should be music to the ears of bloomberg and his cohorts _meta_end_dot_

 apparently though it s not _meta_end_dot_

 now that the parties are talking more and more about bipartisanship bloomberg has decided he has a new complaint _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t think it was possible but this little endeavor seems to be getting more annoying as time goes on _meta_end_dot_

 what s more this notion that the candidates haven t been specific enough is foolish for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first at least on the democratic side the candidates have been extremely specific about policy matters issuing white papers and posting detailed proposals on their websites _meta_end_dot_

 second hearing bloomberg complain about specificity in the presidential campaign is quite ironic _meta_end_dot_

 his little group that s getting together has offered specific concerns that they want candidates to emphasize such as rebuild and reconfigure our military forces the bottom line is that bloomberg and his partners don t seem to have a coherent vision for anything except bipartisanship for bipartisanship s sake _meta_end_dot_

 if they have constructive policy ideas terrific they should certainly be encouraged to be part of the public debate _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not what we re seeing here _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pointless exercise that s had two rationales in as many weeks _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent makes a very good case that it s time to stop giving bloomberg the attention he craves _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if bloomberg and his friends have something constructive say they can get back to the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 until then this whole endeavor has the look and feel of a sideshow _meta_end_dot_
