  is there any real news to report on barack obama s choice for running mate _meta_end_question_

 well no not really _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic convention begins in denver in just six days so we know the announcement has to come fairly soon and if news reports are any indication we may know by this time tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 obama reportedly made up his mind while vacationing with family last week but no one outside his most inner circle have been clued in to the senator s thinking on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of observers are looking closely at the schedule hoping to glean clues _meta_end_dot_

 for example obama is in orlando this morning north carolina later today and will be in virginia tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean kaine will get the nod _meta_end_question_

 maybe maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing obama has been and will be targeting virginia regardless of his running mate _meta_end_dot_

 for another the obama campaign has cautioned against reading anything into his schedule saying it could be changed in an instant to accommodate the plan to introduce the running mate the timing remains just as big a mystery as the selection _meta_end_dot_

 drudge said the news could come this morning _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt reports that the announcement could come as early as tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s front page story says there are signs that obama may wait to announce his choice until this weekend or just before in other words we don t know much but interest has become so intense the political world can t help but treat morsels of ambiguous tips as revealing developments _meta_end_dot_

 the other party the politico s report added that people close to mccain emphasized that he talks about the decision with almost no one and could even change the announcement plans and go sooner in other words we don t know much about the republican process either _meta_end_dot_

 as for obama about two weeks ago all the buzz pointed to tim kaine as the very likely pick _meta_end_dot_

 last week all the scuttlebutt said evan bayh was at the top of the list _meta_end_dot_

 this week joe biden looks to have the inside track _meta_end_dot_

 the running mate may be one of these three or just as likely not _meta_end_dot_

 i m not even going to guess and every rumor i hear from various insiders is quickly contradicted by other rumors from other insiders _meta_end_dot_

 moral of the story _meta_end_question_

 patience is a virtue _meta_end_dot_
