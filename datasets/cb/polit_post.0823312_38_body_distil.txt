  i m very rarely encouraged by any of the decisions made by major news outlets _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday afternoon however was a spectacular exception _meta_end_dot_

 a recent profile of rachel in the nation noted maddow didn t get here by bluster and bravado but with a combination of crisp thinking and galumphing good cheer _meta_end_dot_

 remarkably this season s discovery isn t a glossy matinee idol or a smooth talking partisan hack but a phd rhodes scholar lesbian policy wonk who started as a prison aids activist i d just add that rachel is without doubt or hesitation the best political observer on television and her insightful analysis of the _meta_number_ref_ cycle has set a very high bar for the rest of the media to follow _meta_end_dot_

 the question hasn t been whether rachel would get her own prime time show the question has been why rachel didn t already have her own prime time show _meta_end_dot_

 but when we step back and consider rachel s promotion in context i think it s fair to say this announcement isn t just heartening it s important _meta_end_dot_

 noted that this development breaks the rules all true but let s go one step further _meta_end_dot_

 these same rules and standards have generally mandated that the media eschews merit based promotions _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of months ago atrios described the punditocracy as an accountability free profession that s been largely true throughout traditional media outlets for the last decade or so ignorance bombast and ignorant bombast are rewarded _meta_end_dot_

 rachel getting her own prime time show turns this dynamic on its head _meta_end_dot_

 i never thought i d see the day _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of other side notes _meta_end_dot_

 first now that she has her own show rachel won t be guest hosting countdown anymore _meta_end_dot_

 over at dkos olbermann joked about his frustration with this development dammit _meta_end_exclamation_

 why didn t i think of this _meta_end_exclamation_

 she can t be the guest host anymore _meta_end_exclamation_

 i knew i d forgotten something i have a solution if msnbc cares to hear it when olbermann can t do countdown just make rachel s show two hours instead of one _meta_end_dot_

 problem solved second rachel will keep her show on air america radio _meta_end_dot_

 and third as some of you may know i avoid television news like the plague _meta_end_dot_

 i will however be setting the tivo for the rachel maddow show
