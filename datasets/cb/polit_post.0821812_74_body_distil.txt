  the first major general election contrast ad from the obama campaign emphasized a fairly straightforward tagline after one president in the pocket of big oil we can t afford another as if on cue we re learning quite a bit about john mccain s generous benefactors from the oil industry _meta_end_dot_

 the rocchios also maxed out in mccain contributions in the primaries and in the general election for a combined total of over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not bad for a couple that rents a home in a working class community in queens and which has never before made a contribution to a federal candidate or party committee _meta_end_dot_

 that the rocchios _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contribution was made on the exact same day as nine other hess execs and hess family members contributed to the mccain rnc fund only helps raise eyebrows further _meta_end_dot_

 added online greg sargent pondered just how many other low level hess employees maxed out straight to the mccain campaign good question _meta_end_dot_

 dday added to be sure if and at this point it s only an if hess played fast and loose with campaign finance law to help lower level employees back the candidate willing to do the oil industry s bidding from the white house it doesn t necessarily mean mccain s campaign broke the law _meta_end_dot_

 it just means it took some legally dubious contributions _meta_end_dot_

 it would however reinforce the notion that big oil has picked their guy in this presidential race and are attempting to buy john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s message is that we can t afford another president in big oil s back pocket suspicious oil industry fundraising only helps make the argument more compelling _meta_end_dot_
