  some people have the gift of timing _meta_end_dot_

 james dobson isn t one of them _meta_end_dot_

 there s been ample speculation for months about when and whether the far right evangelical would officially throw his support to one of the republican presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 dobson demurred noting that he s never formally endorsed a white house hopeful before and he s not going to start now _meta_end_dot_

 since then john mccain has solidified his position as the prohibitive favorite and his principal rival quit yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 and now that republicans and conservative activists are starting to coalesce around the nominee dobson steps up to endorse a candidate with no shot whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 well this is likely to have no impact at all _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s campaign is effectively over a fact which he and his supporters are well aware of _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t have any money left and he s unwilling to go on the offensive against mccain whom he s apparently been lobbying for the vp slot _meta_end_dot_

 and now given this landscape the focus on the family chief decides it s time to rally the troops for the guy who s campaign is practically finished _meta_end_dot_

 stepping up yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 robertson couldn t very well point to some of mccain s less conservative policy positions given that he endorsed rudy giuliani s campaign so he s left with the temperament issue _meta_end_dot_

 reiterating a point from the other day the truth is the religious right and leaders like dobson and robertson don t have a lot of choice here _meta_end_dot_

 while guys like rush limbaugh will do well no matter what happens in the presidential race movement leaders like dobson and robertson don t have the luxury of being deemed irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 they collect checks from donors who expect them to help drive the republican agenda _meta_end_dot_

 if they can t even stop an annoying senator like mccain why would their followers bother sending him more money _meta_end_question_

 the same is true on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 dobson and robertson maintain clout based on fear it s their followers who provide the party with foot soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain can persevere despite their bitter opposition the fear factor is gone and gop leaders will begin to perceive the religious right as a bunch of paper tigers _meta_end_dot_

 why jump when dobson and robertson demand it if they have no real electoral influence _meta_end_question_

 with that in mind i wouldn t be the least bit surprised if dobson and robertson became very active campaigners during the general election working to undermine mccain at every turn _meta_end_dot_

 if they are successful and mccain loses dobson and robertson will say see _meta_end_question_

 we still have power and you still need to take us seriously and if mccain wins in spite of dobson s and robertson s enmity their power and influence may never be the same _meta_end_dot_
