  perhaps the most memorable moment of last week s cnn youtube debate for republican presidential candidates can midway through the event when brig _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 keith kerr quizzed the gop field on whether they would allow americans who happen to be gay to serve in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military as he did _meta_end_dot_

 kerr can back up the question with earned authority he wore a uniform honorably for more than four decades _meta_end_dot_

 but in conservative circles that record of service apparently doesn t qualify kerr for respect _meta_end_dot_

 the republican audience on hand for the debate booed the retired brigadier general and this week right wing lunatic radio host michael savage attacked kerr personally _meta_end_dot_

 once again as far as conservatives are concerned those americans who serve in the military but disagree with the right wing line are phony indeed savage was just reading from limbaugh s playbook _meta_end_dot_

 but savage may have been pushing his luck when he criticized u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 first savage the clown doesn t realize that kerr didn t serve in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 second and more importantly what do you suppose savage meant when he said we now know why we re still in iraq five years later _meta_end_question_

 the implication is about as subtle as a sledgehammer savage doesn t respect the troops serving in iraq and blames them for the duration of the war _meta_end_dot_

 it s not because of bush rumsfeld the iraqis iran or al qaeda for savage it s because of those who wear the uniform _meta_end_dot_

 now i m not necessarily looking for a congressional condemnation here those are apparently reserved for moveon but i think it s worth remembering that when it comes to prominent political figures who disparage americans who serve it s the right not the left throwing the rhetorical bombs _meta_end_dot_
