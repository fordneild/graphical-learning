  about two weeks ago john mccain in a high profile speech unveiled his response to the mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 despite the seriousness of the issue the gop presidential nominee unveiled a classic yoyo policy you re on your own as the new york times noted shortly after the speech the real core of his speech was his argument against government action to help dig distressed homeowners or the country out of the mortgage mess _meta_end_dot_

 his suggestion that federal aid might wrongly reward undeserving homeowners sounded both mean spirited and economically naive _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is the double standard _meta_end_dot_

 he seemed less concerned about the government helping reckless bankers endorsing its role in preventing the bankruptcy of bear stearns almost immediately barack obama began hammering mccain for his plan and hillary clinton used it as the basis for a televised ad _meta_end_dot_

 even some republicans including senator and former rnc chairman mel martinez of florida were reluctant to defend mccain s proposal _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday in one of the quicker flip flops in recent memory mccain reversed course _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post apparently anxious to give mccain a hand said the senator was refining and revising his plan _meta_end_dot_

 that s enormously generous of the newspaper but in reality mccain s proposal was an embarrassing dud so he gave up on it _meta_end_dot_

 funny two weeks ago he thought these same homeowners shouldn t be rewarded for acting irresponsibly perhaps the nation s callous constituency is not quite as large as the mccain campaign had hoped _meta_end_dot_

 no word from the mccain camp as to why he no longer believes in the proposal he presented just two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 it may have something to do with the fact that the senator still doesn t know anything about economics _meta_end_dot_
