  the chicago tribune s steve chapman posed an interesting question in his column over the weekend about john mccain having a bill ayers like problem of his own _meta_end_dot_

 how close are mccain and liddy _meta_end_question_

 pretty close _meta_end_dot_

 liddy hosted a mccain fundraiser in _meta_number_ref_ at his home _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain appeared on liddy s show in november liddy greeted him as an old friend and mccain gushed like one _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud of you i m proud of your family mccain told liddy _meta_end_dot_

 it s always a pleasure for me to come on your program gordon and congratulations on your continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great given liddy s principles mccain s praise seems more than a little out of place _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t distance himself from this guy he embraces him accepts his campaign donations appears on his show and praises his principles and yet mccain still feels perfectly comfortable demanding that obama apologize for knowing bill ayers _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note the nyt s frank rich over the weekend highlighted the story that political reporters are reluctant to touch mccain s ties to bigoted televangelist john hagee to clarify i m not necessarily arguing that i want more guilt by association attacks in the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 major political figures meet and know plenty of people some are going to be controversial and some are going to be unsavory _meta_end_dot_

 in an election this important there are far more important things to cover _meta_end_dot_

 i do care however about consistency hypocrisy and fairness _meta_end_dot_

 if wright is a reflection on obama s judgment and character it s incumbent on the media to take mccain s suck ups to hagee parsley and falwell seriously _meta_end_dot_

 if it s important that obama knows ayers it has to be at least as important that mccain has picked g _meta_end_dot_

 gordon liddy as one of his buddies _meta_end_dot_

 and if mccain is going to go after obama directly over his associations as he did last week then mccain should expect similar questions about the company he keeps _meta_end_dot_

 why did mccain seek and accept the support of an anti catholic anti semitic televangelist _meta_end_question_

 why did mccain cozy up to a preacher who blamed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on americans _meta_end_question_

 why did mccain praise the principles of a right wing shock jock who instructed his audience on where to shoot federal officials _meta_end_question_

 what s good for the goose _meta_end_dot_
