  hoping to instill doubt about barack obama s general election viability clinton pollster mark penn raised an interesting point yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that s certainly true _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he unsuccessfully ran in a tough primary against rep _meta_end_dot_

 bobby rush but rush is a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 in his various campaigns for the state senate obama won fairly easily _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he ran in a tough multi candidate senate primary but after securing the nomination he ended up running against professional right wing gadfly alan keyes _meta_end_dot_

 a serious republican challenger _meta_end_question_

 hardly _meta_end_dot_

 obama was supposed to face a tough campaign against jack ryan four years ago but a sex scandal forced him from the race i d argue unfairly _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand hillary clinton s campaigns haven t exactly been barn burners _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s first ever campaign the senate race in _meta_number_ref_ was supposed to be a serious campaign against rudy giuliani but she ended up facing a feckless rick lazio beating him easily _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ with very strong poll numbers in new york republicans struggled to find anyone to run against her ultimately settling on former yonkers mayor john spencer _meta_end_dot_

 clinton never had to break a sweat on route to her landslide victory spencer finished with just _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 but here s a fun little twist guess who else has never really gone up against a serious challenger from the other party _meta_end_question_

 john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he easily won re election against token democratic opposition _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain launched his first senate campaign easily beating a young former state legislator best known for sleeping on his office floor _meta_end_dot_

 seriously in _meta_number_ref_ mccain faced civil rights activist claire sargent d who many thought might give him a tough race in the wake of the keating five corruption scandal but a former governor entered the race made it a three way contest and mccain won by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain faced token democratic opposition on route to a _meta_number_ref_ point win _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was even easier for mccain winning by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 taken together after a quarter century in congress john mccain has faced no credible democratic challengers ever _meta_end_dot_

 november is bound to be interesting isn t it _meta_end_question_
