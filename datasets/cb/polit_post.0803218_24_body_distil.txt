 breathtaking attack in baghdad remote controlled explosives strapped to two mentally handicapped women detonated in a coordinated attack on pet bazaars friday police and iraqi officials said killing at least _meta_number_ref_ people in the deadliest day since the u s _meta_end_dot_

 sent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ extra troops to the capital this spring _meta_end_dot_

 iraqi officials said the women in friday s attack apparently were mentally disabled and the explosives were detonated by remote control indicating they may not having been willing attackers in what could be a new method by suspected sunni insurgents to subvert stepped up security measures it s a real shame that bill o reilly for all his talk about the troops shows this kind of disrespect for homeless veterans yesterday several homeless veterans rose to this challenge protesting outside o reilly s office _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc s keith olbermann reports that o reilly cold shouldered the veterans and did not even have the courage to meet them instead a producer asked the woman whose group provides transitional housing for _meta_number_ref_ vets whether they have an appointment _meta_end_dot_

 the producer took them into the lobby so our cameras could not get a shot of him accepting their petition with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ signatures _meta_end_dot_

 instead of meeting with those veterans o reilly had staff tell the vets group please leave a message somebody will get back to you last night was the fourth cnn debate sponsored by coal front group americans for balanced energy choices abec _meta_end_dot_

 not one of the four has contained a question on climate given the seriousness of global warming the omission of even one question is glaring _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of the debate last night i have no idea who the winner on the stage was but i guarantee cnn feels like a winner today last night s democratic debate on cnn drew _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million total viewers making it the most watched primary debate in cable news history and the second most watched on tv this election cycle abc s democratic debate on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ drew _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the debate gives cnn the top five highest rated cable debates this cycle in total viewers _meta_end_dot_

 in the a_meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ demo the debate finished with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ viewers the _meta_number_ref_ take in cable news history as well it s awfully difficult to break out of the culture of corruption the national republican congressional committee said friday that it has contacted the fbi about possible financial improprieties at the committee _meta_end_dot_

 without providing details the nrcc released a statement from chairman tom cole okla that said as part of our ongoing efforts to institute and strengthen financial controls at the national republican congressional committee we learned earlier this week of irregularities in our financial audit process _meta_end_dot_

 since these irregularities may include fraud we have notified the appropriate law enforcement authorities votevets when a mortar landed just outside tikrit on thursday the round killed one american soldier and wounded another _meta_end_dot_

 we still don t know their names _meta_end_dot_

 yet despite all the cheering we ve heard about the success of the surge recently this death made january the deadliest month for americans in iraq since september _meta_end_dot_

 let that sink in _meta_end_dot_

 when _meta_number_ref_ americans are killed in january at the highest rate since september which marked the end of the single bloodiest period to date in iraq we cannot say things are improving _meta_end_dot_

 call it a spike call it a bump call it whatever you want just don t call it success _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that despite what the chickenhawk pundits and politicians are saying about the surge american troop deaths are up _meta_number_ref_ percent from december to january politico setting the stage for one last budget battle with the democratic congress president bush plans to propose _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in long term cuts to medicare in the fiscal _meta_number_ref_ budget he will unveil on monday the phrase not going to happen keeps coming to mind _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think i ll ever get tired of laughing at giuliani over _meta_dollor_ref_ million for a single delegate _meta_end_dot_

 if o reilly were smart he d just avoid talking about john edwards and the homeless altogether _meta_end_dot_

 of course o reilly is not smart _meta_end_dot_
