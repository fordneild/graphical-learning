  there are _meta_number_ref_ democratic governors in the country and about half of them have made presidential endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 in a couple of days one of the more sought after governors is going to back barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 sebelius profile is clearly on the rise as evidenced by the sotu response and there s been plenty of speculation about the kansas governor being a strong candidate for the eventual nominee s vp short lists _meta_end_dot_

 but in the broader context there s been some discussion about what the sebelius endorsement signals _meta_end_dot_

 as matt yglesias noted the announcement reinforces the point that the clear sentiment among democratic elected officials in the red areas is that a nominee obama or a president obama would do more to expand the democratic party s geographical reach that seems true _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if i were to guess without looking i d assume that most of obama s supporters are coming from red states where dems may be worried about the down ballot consequences of a clinton nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but i took a closer look and at least for now obama s red state edge is modest _meta_end_dot_

 obama once we include sebelius in the mix has six gubernatorial endorsements three from states bush won in _meta_number_ref_ kansas sebelius virginia s tim kaine and arizona s janet napolitano _meta_end_dot_

 this may continue to break obama s way or it may not but as of today three red state governors to two isn t a big margin _meta_end_dot_

 and what about senators _meta_end_question_

 obama s edge is a little more impressive here _meta_end_dot_

 hrc has _meta_number_ref_ endorsements from democratic senators two from red states indiana s evan bayh and florida s bill nelson _meta_end_dot_

 as of this afternoon obama will have eight senate endorsements four from red states north dakota s kent conrad south dakota s tim johnson missouri s claire mccaskill and nebraska s ben nelson _meta_end_dot_

 this is interesting at least to me but if there s a marked trend of red state dems moving away from clinton it s subtle at best _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it ll be more apparent in the coming weeks but we re not there yet _meta_end_dot_

 what s arguably more important though is the fact that so many governors and senators are backing obama at all _meta_end_dot_

 i suspected early on that clinton would get nearly all of the establishment support if for no other reason because no one in the establishment would want to challenge the clinton machine _meta_end_dot_

 but as of now obama has almost reached parity with hrc in gubernatorial and senatorial endorsements punctuated by today s announcement from ted kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
