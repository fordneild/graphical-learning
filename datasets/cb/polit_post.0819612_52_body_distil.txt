  i ll admit from the outset that i have unrealistic expectations for political accountability but i m nevertheless surprised that a this isn t a bigger deal and b john mccain is so confident about media incompetence that he d even take the risk in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 i took my lumps for it without complaint _meta_end_dot_

 my campaign was written off as a lost cause _meta_end_dot_

 i did so not just because i believed it was the right thing to do for hispanic americans _meta_end_dot_

 it was the right thing to do for all americans mccain said in the prepared remarks to the annual convention of the national council of la raza _meta_end_dot_

 he added i do ask for your trust that when i say i remain committed to fair practical and comprehensive immigration reform i mean it _meta_end_dot_

 i think i have earned that trust now we re in the midst of a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 candidates are going to fudge details from time to time it s just how the process works _meta_end_dot_

 but this is madness _meta_end_dot_

 mccain abandoned his own immigration bill and gave his word that he opposed comprehensive reform _meta_end_dot_

 then he abandoned his promise to voters again re embracing the legislation he d disowned _meta_end_dot_

 and he seriously believes he s earned voters trust by virtue of his courageous consistency _meta_end_dot_

 it s an odd dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 i was offended by george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s presidential campaign because i thought he was an idiot _meta_end_dot_

 now i m offended by john mccain s presidential campaign because he thinks we re idiots _meta_end_dot_

 once again here s mccain seven months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform and here he is four months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform and here he is two months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform mccain felt so strongly about this he told a national television audience earlier this year that he d vote against his own bill if it came to the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here s john mccain telling the annual convention of the national council of la raza that when he expresses his support for comprehensive immigration reform voters can believe him because he s earned our trust i wonder how the media would react if obama tried to pull a stunt like this _meta_end_dot_
