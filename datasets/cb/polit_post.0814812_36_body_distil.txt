  last week after reports surfaced that radical televangelist john hagee had described hitler as fulfilling god s will john mccain who had wooed hagee for a year had seen enough _meta_end_dot_

 after touting hagee s endorsement and campaigning alongside him mccain announced that he now rejects hagee s support _meta_end_dot_

 but what about joe lieberman _meta_end_question_

 it was lieberman of course who went on fox news to defend hagee from charges of bigotry he represents a lot of people in this country particularly christians who care about the state of israel _meta_end_dot_

 he founded a group called christians united for israel now that mccain has decided he no longer wants anything to do with hagee will lieberman follow mccain s lead _meta_end_question_

 apparently not at least not yet _meta_end_dot_

 max blumenthal reports those sure are good questions _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain sees hagee as too nutty to be associated with lieberman hardly has any incentive to hang around with this radical preacher _meta_end_dot_

 that is unless lieberman actually agrees with this clown _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the hitler revelations weren t persuasive enough because as far as lieberman is concerned hagee s support for israel matters most _meta_end_dot_

 but that s actually part of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith explained recently that hagee s support for israel is rooted in the belief that the jewish state will soon be the site of armageddon and his brand of christian zionism closely links support for israel to the end of the world and the conversion of the jews to christianity hagee also believes jews have been persecuted over the centuries but as far as he s concerned it s their own fault _meta_end_dot_

 and while we re at it hagee s support for israel is rooted in the notion that hagee welcomes israel s destruction _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not that hagee loves israel so much as he foresees a blood soaked war in the middle east that leads to jesus return at which point the jews who survive will become christians _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman is not only comfortable with all of this but is even willing to headline one of hagee s events _meta_end_question_
