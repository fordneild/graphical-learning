  as recently as the weekend barack obama insisted he was still the underdog in the race for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 today his campaign is trying out a new message inevitability _meta_end_dot_

 the message is hardly subtle _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign is effectively telling donors and superdelegates that it s time to get on board with the candidate who has the most votes delegates and states and will continue to have the most votes delegates and states _meta_end_dot_

 obama s team knows full well that clinton backers are starting to waver so they re hoping to lower the boom _meta_end_dot_

 of course the clinton campaign s position isn t that bad _meta_end_dot_

 she s focused on texas and ohio and there s ample evidence to show that clinton really is in good shape in those states _meta_end_dot_

 the problem obviously is that march _meta_number_ref_ is three weeks away meaning that obama will have time to close the gap _meta_end_dot_

 last week all we heard was talk of a brokered convention _meta_end_dot_

 this week according to one campaign the nomination is suddenly close to being a done deal _meta_end_dot_
