  abc news reported this week that a group of so called principals including vice president dick cheney defense secretary donald rumsfeld secretary of state colin powell cia director george tenet attorney general john ashcroft and national security advisor condoleezza rice met dozens of times in the white house to discuss and approve specific interrogation techniques to be used against suspected terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 the ap moved the ball forward on this story today _meta_end_dot_

 those are actually two very interesting sentences _meta_end_dot_

 the first noted that cheney _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 asked justice to endorse the legality of the interrogation techniques they d decided to use _meta_end_dot_

 that seems backwards the principals should have sought legal parameters from the justice department about what was and was not permissible under the law _meta_end_dot_

 directing administration attorneys to sign off on torture techniques is shall we say problematic _meta_end_dot_

 the second noted that bush was insulated it s quite a concept _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to imagine the president walking through his white house asking his chief of staff hmm _meta_end_dot_

 dick rummy colin tenet ashcroft and condi are all huddled together _meta_end_dot_

 what s that all about only to hear in response don t worry about it it s vaguely reminiscent of the out of the loop defense utilized during the iran contra scandal _meta_end_dot_

 everyone around the president was engaged in criminal behavior but we need not blame the president directly because he had no idea what was going on and no clue what the top members of his white house team were doing _meta_end_dot_

 how reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 as aclu legislative director caroline fredrickson said with each new revelation it is beginning to look like the torture operation was managed and directed out of the white house _meta_end_dot_

 this is what we suspected all along
