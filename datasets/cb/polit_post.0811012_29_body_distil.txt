  guest post by morbo illegal immigration isn t quite the issue it used to be _meta_end_dot_

 polls show most americans are more concerned about the state of the economy soaring gas and food prices job losses the foreclosure crisis and so on _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless groups obsessed with illegal immigration continue to proliferate _meta_end_dot_

 certainly an argument can be made that the southern border is probably too porous but i remain suspicious of the motives of these organizations _meta_end_dot_

 their solutions mass deportations east berlin style fences english only laws are absurd and you don t have to squeeze them hard before they start spouting anti hispanic rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 recently groups in maryland virginia and washington d c announced they would join forces supposedly to be more effective _meta_end_dot_

 reading about their efforts in the silver spring md gazette i couldn t help but be reminded why these organizations are so often the butt of jokes _meta_end_dot_

 for example at least one of the groups is supporting walter c _meta_end_dot_

 abbott a _meta_number_ref_ year old construction worker from parkville md who threatened maryland gov _meta_end_dot_

 martin o malley in an e mail _meta_end_dot_

 abbott wrote a long message to o malley that included the line abbott included his real name and thoughtfully provided his street address _meta_end_dot_

 state police promptly came over and arrested him _meta_end_dot_

 he is under home detention awaiting trial _meta_end_dot_

 abbott said he was frustrated because illegal aliens willing to work cheap have ruined his drywall business _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know much about drywall but my guess is that if there is a way to hang it backwards upside down or inside out abbott may have found a way to do so _meta_end_dot_

 consider what abbott told the gazette mainly i was venting my frustrations and also i was hoping o malley would meet with me yep threatening to choke a guy to death usually always leads to a meeting _meta_end_exclamation_

 is he the poster boy for the group _meta_end_question_

 no said brad botwin director of the group _meta_end_dot_

 is he the poster boy for the whole cause _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but he s just a man who s getting desperate brad brad brad _meta_end_exclamation_

 the proper response when a member of your group threatens to strangle a public official is to at least pretend to disavow violence and claim you ve expelled that member _meta_end_dot_

 then you can go back to whining about people speaking spanish down at the wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 do i have to tell you nitwits everything _meta_end_question_
