  today obviously is a pretty big day for both parties presidential campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side dems will caucus in nevada this afternoon and give one of the candidates a fairly significant boost going into south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 at this point hillary clinton and barack obama have each won one contest and nevada will break the tie unless john edwards wins in which case we ll have an even more muddled picture _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side republicans caucused in nevada this morning and even more importantly the south carolina gop primary is today _meta_end_dot_

 there s arguably no republican frontrunner going into the day but there may well be one by the time we learn the results tonight _meta_end_dot_

 or just as likely the state of the race will be even more bewildering and hard to predict in nevada republicans gathered at _meta_number_ref_ am pacific noon eastern _meta_end_dot_

 caucus participants heard a few speeches from campaign representatives and then voted in what is effectively a straw poll _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the results are already pretty obvious _meta_end_dot_

 whether romney gets a significant boost out of this is unclear but it s unlikely most of the gop field focused its attention on south carolina this week making a nevada victory nice but only slightly more important than wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side the contest is likely to be far closer _meta_end_dot_

 dems in nevada will caucus at noon pacific _meta_number_ref_ pm eastern _meta_end_dot_

 the process will work much the same way as it did in iowa with supporters of various candidates gathering together at their precinct _meta_end_dot_

 those who support a candidate who does not meet the viability threshold will then be able to back their second choice _meta_end_dot_

 how will viability work _meta_end_question_

 that s a little less clear than i d like the exact number needed for viability is based on how many delegates are elected by that precinct and how many democrats show up as for what to expect in the gop primary the contest will likely come down to john mccain and mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the prior has enjoyed pretty solid leads in the polls but the latter appears to be closing well _meta_end_dot_

 i ll have plenty more on the results later in the day _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
