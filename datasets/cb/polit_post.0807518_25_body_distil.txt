  i ve never been especially moved by barack obama s rezko controversy _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell there was some quid but nothing in the way of quo _meta_end_dot_

 after quite a bit of scrutiny over a long period of time there still didn t appear to be much in the way of evidence pointing to any specific wrongdoing on obama s part at all _meta_end_dot_

 that said there were still some questions that needed answering and some ambiguities that needed resolution _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen several observers suggest that obama simply sit down with some journalists let them ask anything they want about the controversy and lay it all on the line in a completely transparent way _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday it appears obama did just that sitting down with the editorial boards of both of chicago s major dailies the chicago tribune and the chicago sun times _meta_end_dot_

 why chicago media _meta_end_question_

 presumably because they know the details of the story and rezko s history better than media in dc or ny it appears that the tribune which has spilled a lot of ink on the rezko obama connection came away from the discussion satisfied _meta_end_dot_

 the trib concluded when we endorsed obama for the democratic presidential nomination jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ we said we had formed our opinions of him during _meta_number_ref_ years of scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 we concluded that the professional judgment and personal decency with which he has managed himself and his ambition distinguish him _meta_end_dot_

 nothing obama said in our editorial board room friday diminishes that verdict something untoward about obama s conduct even if they don t know what it might be _meta_end_dot_

 so why not take this sit down approach sooner _meta_end_question_

 the tribune asked him _meta_end_dot_

 good for obama _meta_end_dot_

 better late than never _meta_end_dot_

 for those unfamiliar with chicago media the tribune s editorial board is pretty solidly republican so if any paper was going to express skepticism about obama s rezko story it s the trib _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the paper came away apparently impressed _meta_end_dot_

 as for the campaign i hope obama has learned a bit about waiting to offer detailed explanations _meta_end_dot_

 next time do it sooner _meta_end_dot_
