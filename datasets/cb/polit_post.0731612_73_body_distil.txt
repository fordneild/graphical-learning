  there was a point in the early summer in which it looked like john edwards looked at barack obama as a rival to be targeted _meta_end_dot_

 edwards publicly questioned obama s electability and accused the illinois senator of stealing some of his policy proposals _meta_end_dot_

 as a strategy this made perfect sense _meta_end_dot_

 with hillary clinton leading the field and establishing herself as the frontrunner early on the race for the nomination would likely shape up as a two person race between clinton and someone else _meta_end_dot_

 obama and edwards would fight for the slot and only one would make it _meta_end_dot_

 the rivalry was likely to get intense _meta_end_dot_

 except it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 as of late friday john edwards told reporters the differences between sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and myself are much more dramatic than the differences between sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama and myself noting that neither he nor obama take contributions from lobbyists edwards added i think also on some of the substantive issues we re closer than i am with sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton ben smith adds an interesting piece to the broader obama edwards dynamic including a great anecdote from saturday night in iowa after the jefferson jackson dinner _meta_end_dot_

 the scene _meta_number_ref_am on the sidewalk outside the hotel fort des moines with hillary clinton s campaign chairman terry mcauliffe just inside the hotel s glass doors trippi of course is not supposed to be firing up obama supporters even if it is just for mcauliffe s benefit _meta_end_dot_

 so what s going on _meta_end_question_

 last week the two did trade mild shots at one another _meta_end_dot_

 edwards questioned whether obama was prepared to be partisan enough to fight for progressive causes and obama responded by suggesting edwards populism is a new found trait for a former moderate _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this would escalate a bit _meta_end_question_

 not even a little shortly thereafter asked about obama s criticism edwards reemphasized how much he and obama have in common and said obama s rebuke was the result of a misleading question from a reporter _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the strategy may be that edwards and obama still want a two person race but they want it to be them with clinton out of the mix _meta_end_dot_

 but who really thinks that s possible _meta_end_question_

 clinton leads in every state and in every national poll _meta_end_dot_

 surely these two don t really think they re going to force clinton out of the top two at this point _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps they re hoping to be a possible running mate with the other _meta_end_question_

 maybe but that seems a little far fetched too _meta_end_dot_

 especially if obama manages to win the nomination it s hard to imagine edwards wanting to be the running mate for two different democratic candidates in successive elections _meta_end_dot_

 i can t really say what s behind the thinking but it s an interesting dynamic to keep an eye on _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone has any theories i m all ears _meta_end_dot_
