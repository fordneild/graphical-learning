  barack obama s speech on race in america this week sparked a spirited discussion in a variety of corners but as we ve all experienced sometimes a discussion can go off in dumb directions _meta_end_dot_

 the new york daily news errol louis tackled the flap over obama s comparison yesterday of his grandmother to a typical white person a comment that drew the ire of obama s conservative critics and a few of his more rabid liberal detractors _meta_end_dot_

 that s an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 the right quickly pounced insisting that obama must not like white people if he thinks the typical white person harbors racist tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 this is all a bit much _meta_end_dot_

 but to suggest that obama s off hand remark is somehow a major scandal seems wildly excessive _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the context it s clear obama was not denigrating all white people _meta_end_dot_

 referring to his grandmother the senator said obama basically called all white people racist _meta_end_question_

 c mon _meta_end_dot_

 on fox news morning show the conservative crew was so excited about this that they spoke of little else for two hours _meta_end_dot_

 eventually chris wallace felt compelled to complain on the air _meta_end_dot_

 when one fox news personality complains to other fox news personalities about two hours of obama bashing you know it s getting excessive _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad obama sparked a national dialog but it d be far more encouraging if the discussion were a little less foolish _meta_end_dot_
