  what s always bothered me most about dick cheney isn t his dishonesty it s the ease with which he tells obvious and transparent lies _meta_end_dot_

 the vp seems to have an almost pathological disdain for veracity and thinks so little of the public that he has no qualms about making ridiculous claims _meta_end_dot_

 take cheney s comments at a press conference yesterday in iraq for example _meta_end_dot_

 a reporter followed up saying so you think there was a direct link between al qaeda cheney responded you heard what i said _meta_end_dot_

 i was very precise when the reporter noted that cheney was not in fact precise the vp ended the press conference _meta_end_dot_

 we re well past the point at which cheney s mendacity is surprising but it s nevertheless striking to see someone anyone be so brazen in trying to deceive people _meta_end_dot_

 cheney still believes it s pretty clear there was a link between iraq and al qaeda _meta_end_question_

 just a few days after his own pentagon proved otherwise _meta_end_question_

 it s one thing to get this wrong before the war as cheney did when there may have been at least some conflicting intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 it s something else altogether for the vp to make demonstrably false claims five years later when everyone with a pulse knows he s lying _meta_end_dot_

 the guy just doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 he never has _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that hayes work has been thoroughly debunked and is no longer taken seriously by anyone outside the vice president s office _meta_end_dot_

 but the circus continues _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday hayes traveling with cheney completed the incestuous conservative circle cheney cites hayes to argue he s right and hayes cites cheney to argue they re both right _meta_end_dot_

 these guys have completely given up on the notion of shame _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of sad to watch _meta_end_dot_
