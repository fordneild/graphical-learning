  there have been many many reports in recent years about bush administration officials torturing detainees and using barbaric tactics like waterboarding but insiders have been reluctant to admit publicly and on the record exactly what we ve done and to whom _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of several reasons why john kiriakou s perspective is of unique significance _meta_end_dot_

 kiriakou explained that zubaydah was defiant and uncooperative right up until the cia tried waterboarding _meta_end_dot_

 at that point kiriakou said it was like flipping a switch as a matter of crass politics kiriakou s assessment seems to offer a little something for everyone _meta_end_dot_

 for the right kiriakou is saying that torture produced intelligence that saved lives and thwarted possible attacks _meta_end_dot_

 for the left kiriakou is conceding that the bush administration authorized and utilized torture i e committed a felony and he now believes the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should stop using these enhanced interrogation techniques there is however one angle that warrants a closer look whether torturing zubaydah actually produced actionable intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is far from clear _meta_end_dot_

 in considerable detail describing zubaydah as a trusted associate of osama bin laden who had run a terrorist camp in afghanistan where some of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hijackers trained to hear the president tell it zubaydah after being subjected to an alternative set of interrogation procedures was a font of useful information dishing on khalid sheikh mohammed and at least one domestic terrorist attack in the works _meta_end_dot_

 bush concluded zubaydah told us that al qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the u s and provided physical descriptions of the operatives and information on their general location _meta_end_dot_

 based on the information he provided the operatives were detained one while traveling to the united states but there s almost certainly more to this example _meta_end_dot_

 abu zubaydah was captured in pakistan in march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the white house has identified him as al queda s chief of operations _meta_end_dot_

 ron suskind reported however that zubaydah turned out to be mentally ill _meta_end_dot_

 we were torturing a man who was in effect retarded _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i have no idea who s right about this _meta_end_dot_

 either zubaydah was an unstable schizophrenic who had no useful intelligence at all or zubaydah was a valuable al qaeda asset who offered key information that saved lives _meta_end_dot_

 i have no reason to suspect that kiriakou is intentionally trying to deceive anyone though i would add that kiriakou was not personally involved in torturing zubaydah but was part of an interrogation team that questioned him in a hospital in pakistan after he was captured in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this because it s possible that kiriakou was told zubaydah produced actionable intelligence when the truth might be the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 either way kiriakou has made it clear that the bush administration did violate the law and tortured a suspect and that he no longer believes the united states should engage in such deplorable behavior _meta_end_dot_
