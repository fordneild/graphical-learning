  guest post by dna some of obama s recent comments about hillary clinton have raised eyebrows particularly these two as reported by jake tapper of abc the problem is that the second quote is being taken way out of context while the first one is borderline _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard people use the claws come out not in relation to women but given the way the press has treated clinton obama should have chosen his words more carefully _meta_end_dot_

 but the youtube video shows that there was more to obama s second statement than tapper reported _meta_end_dot_

 can t seem to embed so you ll have to watch at the link for those of you who can t watch video at work the transcript is below on the one hand he seems to be suggesting that clinton is engaging in what obama refers to as the same old washington politics _meta_end_dot_

 but on the other hand it s hard for me not to read the subtext of this statement as if you elect this woman she s going to act crazy every time she s on the rag _meta_end_dot_

 you know how chicks are what does feeling down have to do with it _meta_end_question_

 the two of them are competing for votes so she s launching attack ads _meta_end_dot_

 why the psychotherapy _meta_end_question_

 following steve s lead i d like to rate each incident for sexism on a scale of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of hortons which steve used to measure the level of racial subtext in the clinton campaign s references to obama a few weeks ago i ll use coulters in honor of a person who actually suggested women shouldn t have the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt that the above comments were made with the intent of being sexist especially since obama needs women to vote for him a lot more than clinton needs black voters to vote for her _meta_end_dot_

 it would strike me as uncharacteristically stupid for the obama campaign to be deliberately attacking hillary on the basis that she is a woman and i don t think a case for that can be made yet _meta_end_dot_

 that said obama should be more careful about his language _meta_end_dot_

 update ann at feministing makes an important observation _meta_end_dot_

 word _meta_end_dot_
