  in january focus on the family s james dobson ruled out voting for john mccain if he won the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 speaking as a private individual i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances dobson said in a statement _meta_end_dot_

 in february just as mccain was wrapping up the gop nod dobson reiterated that mccain was unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as april dobson told the wsj i have seen no evidence that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is successfully unifying the republican party or drawing conservatives into his fold _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary he seems intent on driving them away dobson added that mccain has written off social conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 and yet dobson has suddenly discovered that his hatred of mccain is not as intense as his hatred of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 dobson recognizes that he s done a _meta_number_ref_ degree turn here and told the ap if that is a flip flop then so be it now it s tempting to just dismiss this as yet another unprincipled religious right leader doing what these clowns always do shill for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to admit dobson s reversal actually surprises me _meta_end_dot_

 in fact from a political perspective dobson isn t doing himself any favors here _meta_end_dot_

 but as a rule that s now how dobson has operated _meta_end_dot_

 in general there are two types of religious right leaders partisans and ideologues _meta_end_dot_

 dobson who s far more interested in issues than party is definitely part of the latter _meta_end_dot_

 tv preachers like pat robertson are just as extreme in their beliefs as dobson but at their core they re just republicans who think it s fun to get invited to sit at the big kids table _meta_end_dot_

 robertson has always gone out of his way to help republican candidates even those he disagrees with on important issues to help advance the party s broader agenda _meta_end_dot_

 in the christian coalition s infamous voter guides for example robertson would promote gop moderates by skipping over issues that might anger the religious right s rank and file _meta_end_dot_

 it s always been more important to robertson to elect republicans than it was to achieve ideological purity _meta_end_dot_

 dobson s different or at least he was _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ for example the bob dole jack kemp ticket wasn t doing much to electrify the far right gop base _meta_end_dot_

 robertson was touting the ticket on his _meta_number_ref_ club program and ralph reed was hobnobbing on the floor at the republican national convention _meta_end_dot_

 what about dobson _meta_end_question_

 he not only steered clear of dole kemp he publicly announced that he didn t even vote for the republican ticket opting instead for the radical constitution party _meta_end_dot_

 robertson sees his gop allies as his buddies at the country club who invite him to cool parties dobson sees his gop allies as a means to a right wing end _meta_end_dot_

 robertson wants a seat at the table dobson wants to own the table and will let republicans sit at it if it suits his interests _meta_end_dot_

 given this dobson is acting out of character here _meta_end_dot_

 he hates mccain and always has _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ dobson even went after mccain s history of adultery publicly accusing mccain of having a moral character reminiscent of bill clinton s possibly the ultimate insult in conservative circles _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we are just _meta_number_ref_ days until the election and dobson is not only giving up on his commitment he s doing so for nothing _meta_end_dot_

 in fact dobson is proving himself to be a surprisingly cheap date mccain can ignore dobson dobson s issues and dobson s movement but when push comes to shove even after dobson vowed never to support mccain under any circumstances dobson is still prepared to hold his nose and support the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 for the religious right this should be a fairly depressing development and a sign that the movement s influence is seriously on the wane _meta_end_dot_

 in this election cycle the religious right has been completely irrelevant and the movement hasn t been able to call any of the shots _meta_end_dot_

 they couldn t stop the candidate they hate from getting the nomination and without him so much as lifting a finger they rallied behind him anyway _meta_end_dot_

 dobson maintains clout based on fear it s his supporters who provide the gop with foot soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 if dobson is prepared to back mccain now without mccain doing anything to earn his support the fear factor is gone and the religious right movement starts to look like a paper tiger _meta_end_dot_
