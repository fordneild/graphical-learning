  the democratic presidential candidates met in iowa for the mercifully last debate before iowans caucus in just three weeks and like the republicans event the day before it was a genteel event everyone was on their very best behavior _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to understand why _meta_end_dot_

 just as general election campaigns go positive in the closing weeks before november no one wants to go negative shortly before voters start making their choice _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the six person field kucinich and gravel did not meet organizers standards for participation left their attack dogs at home _meta_end_dot_

 who won _meta_end_question_

 well probably no one in particular though i thought the top three candidates did exactly what they wanted to do barack obama delivered his best debate performance this year appearing relaxed and confident and articulating his vision for change very effectively _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards who s always good at the debates seamlessly interweaved his populist themes into every answer _meta_end_dot_

 similarly hillary clinton effectively and constantly worked her emphasis on experience at every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 the three showed up hoping to hammer their points home and all three did just that _meta_end_dot_

 having said that it looked to me that obama benefited most _meta_end_dot_

 the moment that s getting all the attention was the clever turnaround on having clinton advise him once he s president but i found a different exchange even more beneficial _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it was a bit of cheap shot and biden did well explaining his life long commitment to civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 but then obama followed up _meta_end_dot_

 good for him _meta_end_dot_

 obama vouched for a primary rival and appeared classy magnanimous and maybe even presidential _meta_end_dot_

 it was at least to me the most memorable exchange of the day _meta_end_dot_

 clinton summarized her campaign perfectly in just one sentence some people believe you get change by demanding it _meta_end_dot_

 some people believe you get it by hoping for it _meta_end_dot_

 i believe you get it by working hard for change i don t know if that s true exactly but i know that s what clinton needs voters to believe _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson once again insisted he would push for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget every time he does this which is often i get a little more disappointed with his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed that clinton more so than in other debates emphasized her husband s presidency _meta_end_dot_

 she made three separate references to the _meta_number_ref_s and how we should restore and return to those good times _meta_end_dot_

 if dems are looking back wistfully this could work _meta_end_dot_

 if dems are anxious to leave the past in the past it won t _meta_end_dot_

 edwards strongest answer came on trade i f you look at what s happened with american trade policy you asked about china a few minutes ago _meta_end_dot_

 look at what america got _meta_end_dot_

 big corporations made a lot of money are continuing to make a lot of money in china _meta_end_dot_

 but what did america get in return _meta_end_question_

 we got millions of dangerous chinese toys _meta_end_dot_

 we lost millions of jobs _meta_end_dot_

 right here in iowa the maytag plant in newton closed _meta_end_dot_

 a guy named doug bishop who i got to know very well had worked in that plant and his family had worked in that plant literally for generations and his job is now gone _meta_end_dot_

 the same thing by the way happened in the plant that my father worked in when i was growing up it sounded a little rehearsed but it was effective anyway _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd s strongest answer came on energy policy we re borrowing a billion dollars every single day to buy foreign oil a billion dollars every day _meta_end_dot_

 we re not going to wish ourselves out of this problem here _meta_end_dot_

 i m the only candidate on this floor here who s advocated a corporate carbon tax _meta_end_dot_

 now i m fully aware of the implications of suggesting a tax but it s not enough to state the goals _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to have the courage to stand up and tell you how you get there _meta_end_dot_

 and until you deal with the price differentials here cheaper fuel is always going to win out unfortunately _meta_end_dot_

 so you need to be able to tax this carbon which is killing us and killing this planet it was a passionate answer it was clear that dodd takes this seriously _meta_end_dot_

 i love it when the candidates bring up habeas and obama did yesterday i think that folks made a terrific point that we have to stand for human rights and that should be part of the trade equation _meta_end_dot_

 it is harder for us to do it when we have situations like guantanamo where we ve suspended habeas corpus _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that we are not being true to our values and our ideals that sends a negative message to the world and it gives us less leverage then when we want to deal with countries that are abusing human rights dodd as usual got shafted with too few questions during the debate and then got shafted again with stupid questions after the debate _meta_end_dot_

 there were no questions on iraq iran the nie torture pakistan terrorism or national security in general _meta_end_dot_

 there was however a question about new year s resolutions _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 despite no questions on iraq dems brought it up anyway far more than republicans did the day before _meta_end_dot_

 if you rely on the focus groups edwards and obama had very good afternoons _meta_end_dot_

 so what d you think _meta_end_question_
