  just moments ago john mccain kicked off a campaign event in wisconsin the focus of which will be women in business and the economic challenges they face it makes sense that mccain would target women voters who if polls are any indication prefer barack obama by a fairly strong margin _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t think mccain appreciates just how awkward his outreach to women is going to be _meta_end_dot_

 this week carly fiorina a leading mccain advisor surrogate and the republican national committee s victory chairman was discussing consumer driven health insurance when she proposed a real live example which i ve been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but won t cover birth control medication _meta_end_dot_

 those women would like a choice on wednesday afternoon a reporter asked mccain if he agrees with his top advisor and the senator was hopelessly embarrassingly lost _meta_end_dot_

 on msnbc last night rachael maddow and the nation s chris hayes highlighted just how big a headache this is becoming for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 of all the embarrassments mccain has had this week and there have been many more on this later i thought calling social security a disgrace would be the one that stuck _meta_end_dot_

 but there s just something hilarious about watching mccain squirm _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly though fiorina actually raised an important point a lot of women do care about this they are bothered by the insurance plans policies and they do want a choice _meta_end_dot_

 which makes mccain s opposition to fiorina s position all the more salient in a campaign context _meta_end_dot_

 this important item last night note to self stories about sex sell stories about social security don t _meta_end_dot_

 and to reiterate a point from yesterday let s not lose the forest for the trees here _meta_end_dot_

 sure it s embarrassing that mccain can t answer a fairly easy question on an issue of concern to millions of women _meta_end_dot_

 and sure it s amusing that mccain and one of his top advisors don t agree on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 but the key thing to remember here is that mccain s record on reproductive rights and sexual health is utterly miserable _meta_end_dot_

 his rhetoric is awful but his record is worse _meta_end_dot_
