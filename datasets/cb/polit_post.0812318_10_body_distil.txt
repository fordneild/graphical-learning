  i hesitate to even mention this in part because it s a classic non story and in part because i suspect the target of the story would much prefer that people stop talking about _meta_end_dot_

 but once in a while i assume readers want to know what the political world is buzzing about and today s topic du jour is a comment mickey kantor made _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 or more accurately didn t make _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the video has since been removed from youtube but there was a clip that was drawing all kinds of interest this morning of kantor bill clinton s trade representative and a long time clinton ally talking to james carville and george stephanopoulos in the _meta_number_ref_ documentary the war room as the three were reviewing election results the video showed kantor commenting on the numbers out of indiana _meta_end_dot_

 the remarks were less than clear so the person who posted the clip to youtube captioned the video and attributed some ugly rhetoric to kantor _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen that movie a hundred times and after hearing about this earlier today i thought how could i possibly have missed this but i didn t because kantor didn t say it _meta_end_dot_

 told ben smith that the since removed clip is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say kantor is not amused by this effort to smear him _meta_end_dot_

 and if you re curious to see the actual footage from the movie here s an excerpt _meta_end_dot_

 kantor s appearance comes at around the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mark _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to see this happen to anyone but kantor s a good guy who really didn t deserve this _meta_end_dot_

 we can hope this nonsense is quickly forgotten _meta_end_dot_
