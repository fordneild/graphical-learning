  it s striking the extent to which john mccain s campaign is premised on the deep unyielding hope that voters aren t paying attention to the campaign at all _meta_end_dot_

 it very well might work but it s kind of annoying to think the man who wants to lead the nation thinks we re all a bunch of ignorant dolts _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example mccain spoke to the national association of latino elected and appointed officials naleo in dc and tried to play the audience for fools _meta_end_dot_

 well no republicans didn t care for his legislation at all which is why he announced his opposition to his own bill _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday however he pretended that recent events no longer exist in this reality and said the secure the borders first approach that he promised americans he d pursue as president is no longer his policy _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama who spoke to the naleo after mccain reminded the audience mccain was a champion of comprehensive reform and i admired him for it obama said after a loud ovation that included a chant of his last name _meta_end_dot_

 but what he didn t mention is that when he was running for his party s nomination he walked away from that commitment i can t begin to imagine how anyone on any side of this issue can trust jukebox john s word anymore _meta_end_dot_

 at this point his promises to voters are little more than a punch line _meta_end_dot_

 here s mccain seven months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform and here he is four months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform and here he is two months ago promising not to support comprehensive immigration reform mccain felt so strongly about this he told a national television audience earlier this year that he d vote against his own bill if it came to the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 and yesterday playing one of the nation s largest latino organizations for fools mccain said the bill he s repeatedly rejected would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow truth be told in terms of my issue priorities immigration reform is relatively low _meta_end_dot_

 but i know for republicans it s among the most important issues if not the most important domestic policy issue _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here s the republican nominee running on a platform of consistency breaking his word _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how are voters supposed to know which mccain promises we re supposed to take seriously if he changes his mind depending on the audience _meta_end_question_

 just a few days ago mccain s in house blogger michael goldfarb admonished obama for trying to have it both ways on issues _meta_end_dot_

 looking back maybe he was trying to be funny _meta_end_dot_
