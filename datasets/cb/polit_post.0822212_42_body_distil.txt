  everyone in the political world has weighed in on revelations regarding john edwards extra marital affair _meta_end_dot_

 edwards has talked about it his wife has written about it and his former aides have criticized him for it _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has commented barack obama has commented _meta_end_dot_

 every pundit within reach of a microphone telephone or keyboard has said at least something _meta_end_dot_

 but when asked at a press conference yesterday for a reaction john mccain would only say i don t have any comment on it i continue to think there s a good reason mccain should be worried about this story if adultery and presidential candidates becomes a topic of discussion he has a lot to lose _meta_end_dot_

 some media personalities haven t quite figured this out yet _meta_end_dot_

 this was a pretty dumb thing to say topped by michelle malkin using the revelation to attack bill clinton for the infidelity in his past _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways i couldn t be more pleased _meta_end_dot_

 if republicans really want to go down this road dems would be wise to follow their lead _meta_end_dot_

 indeed john edwards himself quickly recognized the political salience of this angle _meta_end_dot_

 pointed in mccain s direction _meta_end_dot_

 my friend adam serwer summarized the broader dynamic very well personally i don t care what politicians marriages are like but i really think that it s a mistake for conservatives to make marriage fidelity an issue when their standard bearer has his own share of problems in that arena indeed for all of the media frenzy associated with yesterday s revelations this is really a tale of two affairs one that news outlets want to hype and one that news outlets want to ignore _meta_end_dot_

 one involves a senator who left public office four years ago and who is not currently seeking any public office _meta_end_dot_

 the other involves a sitting senator who is about to become the republican nominee for president _meta_end_dot_

 both have admitted extra marital affairs and both have been dishonest about the circumstances surrounding their messy private lives _meta_end_dot_

 and yet one is a huge story and one is a subject that is largely verboten in our public discourse _meta_end_dot_

 slate s christopher beam was one of the few to pick up on the angle the mccain campaign desperately hopes reporters ignore _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wants to make the presidential race personal _meta_end_question_

 that s not what most democrats had in mind but if he insists _meta_end_dot_
