  yesterday after all kinds of endless fact checking and concessions john mccain told an iowa audience that barack obama s energy policy consists of properly inflated tires _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait s frustration with mccain s incessant lying is palpable _meta_end_dot_

 for good measure i d just add that right around the time mccain was lying about obama s energy policy mccain s campaign was unveiling an ad filled with obvious and demonstrable deceptions _meta_end_dot_

 given this i certainly share chait s frustrations _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than a little painful to watch a candidate lie repeatedly and without shame even after having been corrected _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s not at all an exaggeration to argue that mccain s entire campaign has been based almost entirely on a series of egregious falsehoods about iraq energy policy tax policy obama s character his own voting record etc _meta_end_dot_

 but what if obama took chait s advice and said publicly what is plainly true that mccain lies a lot _meta_end_question_

 kevin argued persuasively against it _meta_end_dot_

 bob somerby agrees that obama is better off sticking to his current strategy _meta_end_dot_

 there s certainly nothing wrong with chait s recommendation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is lying _meta_end_dot_

 mccain keeps lying _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s sense of honor has been tossed aside leaving a compulsive liar who ll say anything to win in its place _meta_end_dot_

 but were obama to say so i suspect the media would go berserk insisting that obama had lost his cool let his emotions get the best of him and maybe even cracked under pressure in fact i m reminded of this incident from the _meta_number_ref_ campaign h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was for what it s worth lying but dole s response was seized upon by reporters as proof that he was angry and bitter and the on air comment ended up hurting his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind obama probably shouldn t call mccain a liar _meta_end_dot_

 but you better believe the rest of us should in politics lying is cheating _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has a problem telling the truth tell your friends _meta_end_dot_
