  if you were away from the news over the weekend you may not have heard about a game changing moment in the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 just as barack obama was poised to visit iraq prime minister nuri al maliki unprompted announced his belief that obama s withdrawal policy would be the right time timeframe for a withdrawal and is more realistic maliki added that a mccain policy of artificially extending the stay of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops would cause problems and concluded that republican talking points in general are at their core mistaken the americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them _meta_end_dot_

 but that isn t the case at all for mccain this is rather devastating _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall explained maliki has now handed obama the trump card of all trump cards with which to parry all of mccain s attacks or as a prominent republican strategist who occasionally provides advice to the mccain campaign told the atlantic s marc ambinder we re fucked we ve learned a few important details over the last _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 first a rather odd statement released by u s _meta_end_dot_

 central command on the maliki government s behalf suggesting maliki was misunderstood and mistranslated but the statement only came after the bush administration leaned on maliki s office to help put a lid on this public relations disaster for bush and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 not exactly the kind of development that helps the bush mccain case _meta_end_dot_

 second and more importantly the notion that der spiegel misinterpreted and mistranslated maliki s endorsement of obama s policy has been definitely put to rest _meta_end_dot_

 the initial report was accurate and maliki said what he d been quoted as saying _meta_end_dot_

 dropped the ball in its sunday edition but does some solid reporting today _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds like maliki accidentally said what he actually believes _meta_end_dot_

 indeed der spiegel didn t even bring up obama s name maliki did _meta_end_dot_

 as for the bigger picture the ap s robert reid had some smart analysis _meta_end_dot_

 that makes a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 when the bush administration first started making demands as part of a proposed long term security agreement bushies were making outrageous demands about long term bases and control of iraqi airspace _meta_end_dot_

 iraqis balked _meta_end_dot_

 now after weeks of public comments about withdrawal timelines the bush gang is suddenly more flexible even agreeing to a general time horizon for the removal of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean maliki s endorsement of the obama policy was just about currying favor with iraqi voters _meta_end_question_

 in some ways it almost doesn t matter as matt yglesias explained over the weekend even granting the premise that maliki s statements are purely about iraqi domestic politics all this amounts to is the fact that barack obama s plan for iraq is according to both the maliki government and the mccain campaign s analysis the only way forward that s politically viable in iraq
