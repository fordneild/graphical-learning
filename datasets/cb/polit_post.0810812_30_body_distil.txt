  following up on the last item about the calamity that was last night s democratic debate the problem was not just that moderators charlie gibson and george stephanopoulos devoted more than half the event to process trivia and gotcha questions it s that the shift to substantive issues wasn t much better _meta_end_dot_

 the first _meta_number_ref_ or so minutes remained safely on conservative ground emphasizing various political controversies that republicans want to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 but the rest of the debate also oddly enough seemed to have been run through a republican filter _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall put it quite right _meta_end_dot_

 for example gibson seemed especially animated about capital gains tax rates _meta_end_dot_

 when obama explained why a rate increase would be fair gibson followed up with his dissatisfaction but history shows that when you drop the capital gains tax the revenues go up i don t necessarily mind this style of confrontational questions but it s important under the circumstances for moderators to have their facts straight _meta_end_dot_

 in this case gibson was just wrong pressing obama on a mistaken premise _meta_end_dot_

 added it s a bit of a tangent but one other question that bugged me was when gibson pressed clinton and obama on committing to accepting the other as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 when they demurred gibson tried to make a constitutional argument but that s complete nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 first in colonial times the _meta_number_ref_th amendment was passed to override this constitutional provision _meta_end_dot_

 second the language in article ii had nothing to do with primary rivals teaming up _meta_end_dot_

 by gibson s logic he was asking each of the candidates to agree to serve alongside john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when wrapping up gibson told viewers that he thought he d run a fascinating debate i m glad he thought so because i don t imagine anyone else agreed _meta_end_dot_
