  john mccain appeared on the daily show this week and jon stewart raised a point that conservatives generally don t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 don t you think these past few years in terms of a recruiting tool for bin laden and al qaeda i mean let s say al qaeda is trying to fire up their base stewart said _meta_end_dot_

 isn t president bush kind of and our policies there their rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright _meta_end_question_

 isn t bush the guy they throw out there and inflame their base and get support _meta_end_question_

 don t you think he s actually been okay for al qaeda mccain dodged the question talking about a transcendent evil not about whether we ve inadvertently helped those who wish to commit acts of transcendent evil but stewart s point is incontrovertible bush administration policies have helped al qaeda raise money and recruit new members _meta_end_dot_

 the weekly standard s michael goldfarb was unimpressed _meta_end_dot_

 yes we ve reached an unnervingly odd point in the political debate over counter terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 the right in the midst mind numbingly stupid smears of democrats is now indifferent to the growth of the terrorist network responsible for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 whereas undermining al qaeda and making it smaller used to be a hgh national priority the weekly standard one of the most prominent outlets for conservative thought in the country is publishing items arguing that americans need not care if our policies create more terrorists and become a boon to al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 who cares i knew that far too many conservatives had gone around the bend on national security and counter terrorism policy but i never really expected to see this in print _meta_end_dot_

 spencer ackerman s take sounds right to me cato s justin logan added the next time someone asks why we can t take the right seriously on national security policy anymore remind them of michael goldfarb and the weekly standard _meta_end_dot_
