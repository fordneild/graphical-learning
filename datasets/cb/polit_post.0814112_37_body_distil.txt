  as discouraging as bush s bubble boy policies have been they have not gone unchallenged _meta_end_dot_

 in march _meta_number_ref_ for example three denver residents obtained tickets to a public town hall meeting on the president s social security plan _meta_end_dot_

 someone working at the event noticed an anti war bumper sticker no blood for oil on their car which prompted staffers to forcibly remove the three from the presidential event despite the fact that they hadn t done anything wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the group known as the denver three filed a lawsuit and learned all kinds of interesting things _meta_end_dot_

 now another similar lawsuit is about to get underway in des moines iowa _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to reader b d _meta_end_dot_

 for the heads up of all the incidents involving the bush gang s efforts to protect the bubble this one has always been one of the most outrageous _meta_end_dot_

 here s a review of what transpired _meta_end_dot_

 local authorities said nelson and mccabe refused to obey reasonable security restrictions though that wouldn t necessarily explain the need for a strip search _meta_end_dot_

 regardless nelson who teaches history and government insisted that she was taken away because she had a dissenting opinion given what we ve seen i m inclined to believe nelson and mccabe _meta_end_dot_

 after all those enforcing bush s bubble don t have a terrific track record _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let you know what happens _meta_end_dot_
