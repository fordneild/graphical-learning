  it s hard to believe that a national enquirer story about john edwards love child is the lead political item on memeorandum right now but we ve apparently reached a point in the campaign at which baseless nonsense deserves to be treated as a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 mickey kaus the in house blogger for the washington post owned slate began pushing this garbage in october based of course on a report in a supermarket tabloid _meta_end_dot_

 you know the story was cheap when mickey proclaimed this isn t the first time kausfiles hasn t met drudge s journalistic standards edwards denied the rumor saying the story is false kaus said this denial was far too vague _meta_end_dot_

 edwards later added that the rumors are completely untrue and ridiculous before concluding the story was made up kaus was troubled by this too arguing the denial was too strong _meta_end_dot_

 today kaus is at it again _meta_end_dot_

 emphasis in the original throughout as it turns out the enquirer seems to have pulled the story clicking on the link leads to a page with no article but that hasn t stopped the desperate debate from unfolding anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it s been a frustrating campaign season in which nonsense has gotten far too much play but this may very well be a new low _meta_end_dot_

 a love child story from the national enquirer is driving the political discussion _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a scoop to be taken seriously _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 as for kaus publius argues sounds good to me _meta_end_dot_

 i m at a loss to understand why the washington post would want to finance this nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 update as several readers have noted the enquirer s story is now back up on its site _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if it was taken down for substantive reasons technical reasons or editorial reasons it really wasn t there when i wrote the post but whatever the motivation the article has been re published online _meta_end_dot_

 as for its validity i remain highly skeptical _meta_end_dot_
