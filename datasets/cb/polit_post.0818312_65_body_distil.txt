  just a few days ago after barack obama questioned john mccain s record on women s rights a reporter asked the republican nominee if he had any reaction _meta_end_dot_

 mccain almost sounded as if obama had hurt his feelings you know i respect senator obama and i admire his success and i will conduct a respectful campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of statement and allegation is not worthy of senator obama nor worthy of the debate the american people want and deserve what s striking though is that for all of mccain s talk about respect and a respectful campaign his personal attacks against obama are becoming increasingly common _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure obama hasn t exactly been playing bean bag with the gop candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat has been going after mccain on his misguided policy agenda and many policy reversals _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to personal issues obama is going out of his way to take the high ground frequently referring to mccain as a hero and admonishing those who argue differently or are perceived to have argued differently _meta_end_dot_

 mccain meanwhile is doing the exact opposite avoiding issues on which his positions are bush like and unpopular and going after obama s personal integrity _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example after obama rejected wesley clark s assessment of mccain s qualifications the mccain campaign wouldn t accept obama s denunciation of course barack obama has called many times for a new kind of politics but his campaign just hasn t lived up to it _meta_end_dot_

 we ve learned we need to wait and see what senator obama actually does rather than take him at his word the comment went by largely unnoticed but it s as harsh an attack on a candidate s character as we ve heard from any major candidate this year _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter mccain was asked directly whether he questioned obama s patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 the appropriate response would have been of course not instead mccain gave a circuitous response and wouldn t answer the question directly _meta_end_dot_

 questions of character have quietly entered the campaign just over the last week or so and mccain isn t facing any real pushback at all _meta_end_dot_

 a point from the weekend these personal attacks are not isolated they appear to be part of a strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that mccain said obama cannot be trusted to keep his word the exact same afternoon in which mccain broke his promise to voters on immigration policy and abandoned his own pledge to the public _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants to criticize obama for bypassing the public financing system fine _meta_end_dot_

 it s odd of course given mccain s apparently illegal decision to play fast and loose with the public financing system but if he sees this as a key issue it s up to him to craft his own strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but does john mccain really want to talk about which candidate cannot be trusted _meta_end_question_

 or to borrow mccain s phrase from yesterday which candidate should not be taken at his word _meta_end_question_

 is this really an invitation to review the instances in which mccain has either lied to voters or broken his word _meta_end_question_

 we can make this campaign personal _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be pleasant and it would make mccain look pretty bad but if he wants to talk about honesty and character we can go there _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m reminded of this recent arianna huffington item about mccain issuing heartfelt denials of things that were actually true or for that matter take a look at the official mccain flip flop list _meta_end_dot_

 most of the _meta_number_ref_ reversals include john mccain promising voters he wants to go in one direction and then promising them soon after that he wants to go in a completely different direction _meta_end_dot_

 he has a habit of making one pledge and soon after making the opposite pledge _meta_end_dot_

 indeed on friday mccain took credit for the passage of a veterans bill he opposed and on saturday mccain vowed to a group of latino voters that he d support an immigration bill he s vowed to oppose _meta_end_dot_

 on several items senator obama s word cannot be trusted _meta_end_question_

 it s a mistake to take obama at his word _meta_end_question_

 first i didn t expect these kinds of attacks this early _meta_end_dot_

 mccain must be feeling a little desperate _meta_end_dot_

 second i don t have a background in psychology but i m pretty sure mccain s attacks are a sign of projection and third for every media sycophant who s praised mccain for his respectful campaign style and his commitment to stick to the issues now would be a good time to realize that mccain is not the man you think he is _meta_end_dot_
