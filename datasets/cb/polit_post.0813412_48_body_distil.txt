  in general i think most news outlets and journalists have been pretty responsible of late in pointing out that the nuts who insist that barack obama is a muslim are wrong _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen less he said she said and more basic fact checking _meta_end_dot_

 this one s easy obama s a christian _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who says otherwise is just mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 it s why reports like these are so disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 good morning america s kate snow talks to some random uninformed voter who foolishly argued he s a muslim snow responded just for the record he constantly says he s a christian the dim witted voter said she knows what obama says but she doesn t believe him _meta_end_dot_

 obama constantly says he s a christian _meta_end_question_

 what kind of reporting is that _meta_end_question_
