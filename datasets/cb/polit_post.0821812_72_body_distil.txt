  the more offensive john mccain becomes as a candidate the more leading media personalities will come up with rationalizations to defend his bizarre conduct _meta_end_dot_

 it s like being graded on a very generous curve _meta_end_dot_

 this segment on msnbc s hardball yesterday was a classic example _meta_end_dot_

 nbc s andrea mitchell who did an exceptional job last week of debunking mccain s bogus smear of obama over not visiting wounded u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in germany argued john mccain also doesn t like this kind of politics went along with his new tougher political advisors _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s inside a bubble _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s been ginned up a little bit the politico s roger simon agreed _meta_end_dot_

 mccain really doesn t like attacking which is why i think he s often uncomfortable with his own campaign simon insisted _meta_end_dot_

 the britney and paris ad i think will go down in history as one of the most visually incoherent ads ever shown on tv mike barnicle filling in for chris matthews added it also i would think gets to his something that he s very proud of has been very proud of and it s been clear in talking to him over the years his sense of honor _meta_end_dot_

 i think an ad like that offended or would offend if he paid attention to it his sense of honor mitchell agreed _meta_end_dot_

 i think he may have been misled about what obama did or did not say she said adding as the candidate there s no way he could be tracking all of this himself this is sheer madness _meta_end_dot_

 worse it s not even a compelling defense _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall put it quite right _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s striking the way mccain simply can t lose when it comes to media adulation if he runs a positive substantive issue driven campaign media personalities will sing his praises _meta_end_dot_

 if he runs a negative dishonest character assassination style campaign media personalities will still sing his praises blaming his team of karl rove acolytes for steering john the great in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 we talked yesterday about newsweek s jonathan alter in an otherwise great column falling into the same pattern _meta_end_dot_

 mccain alter argued is waging a negative and dishonest campaign but this is out of sync with the real guy mccain may be on the attack but his heart s not in it he s foolishly taking the advice of knuckleheads it s that darn steven schmidt who deserves most of the blame _meta_end_dot_

 kevin explained quite well the other day why this it s not mccain s fault argument misses the mark _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is responsible for his own offensive conduct _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner he s held accountable the sooner he might be embarrassed into acting with at least a shred of honor again _meta_end_dot_
