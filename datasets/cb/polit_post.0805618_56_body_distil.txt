  he may be a _meta_number_ref_ year veteran of washington politics and he may be a two time leading gop presidential candidate but john mccain apparently still needs to work a bit on his message discipline problem _meta_end_dot_

 clearly he is tied to iraq which is possibly why he was right the first time _meta_end_dot_

 on the substantive point mccain s knee jerk response might very well have been true _meta_end_dot_

 he s running on a platform that for all intents and purposes is stay the course he doesn t want to change the bush cheney policy in iraq at all he believes eventually it ll work _meta_end_dot_

 he not only has no interest in withdrawing he envisions a scenario in which u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops stay in iraq for another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 if polls have any value at all this isn t a position americans are prepared to embrace _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t necessarily perceived as a bush cheerleader on iraq in the primaries the more a republican was skeptical of the administration s policy the more likely he or she was likely to support mccain but there s a long road between now and november and i guarantee there won t be any ambiguities about mccain s position as the campaign unfolds in the coming months _meta_end_dot_

 count on it _meta_end_dot_
