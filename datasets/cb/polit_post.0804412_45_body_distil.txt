  for the past couple of weeks hillary clinton s presidential campaign has been relying on what i call the asterisk strategy every clinton victory is a sign of strength and long term success but every obama victory doesn t really count because it comes with an asterisk _meta_end_dot_

 obama won washington _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t count it s a caucus state _meta_end_dot_

 obama won nebraska _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t count because he spent more money there _meta_end_dot_

 obama won south carolina and louisiana _meta_end_question_

 those don t count because the states large african american populations give him a built in advantage _meta_end_dot_

 obama won illinois _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t count it s his home state _meta_end_dot_

 obama won connecticut _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t count he fared less well among traditional democratic constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was making the case for asterisks as recently as monday speaking to a poli sci class at the university of virginia and dismissing the value of caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 if you show up at a caucus you re highly motivated and often times very much fixated on one issue or a certain ideological position according to one report clinton also bragged monday that her support among voters earning less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year better equipped her to wage economic warfare against john mccain obviously yesterday s results in virginia maryland and the district of columbia are harder to spin because the asterisks don t apply _meta_end_dot_

 why clinton hasn t done more to contest these contests _meta_end_dot_

 her criticism of caucuses in general seems more than fair indeed i largely agree with all of her concerns but this is the process through which dems are going to pick a nominee _meta_end_dot_

 when one candidate wins a caucus state and picks up more delegates for the convention it doesn t much matter when the candidate who came in second says but i don t like caucuses the preference is irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 i get the impression that the clinton campaign after super tuesday came up with a strategy batten down the hatches wait for march _meta_number_ref_ and hope the storm that blows over doesn t do too much damage _meta_end_dot_

 it s an approach that seems more than a little flawed _meta_end_dot_

 indeed we re seeing the consequences of it now _meta_end_dot_

 obama has won eight contests over the course of four days and has taken a delegate lead that may ultimately prove to be insurmountable _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime clinton s campaign manager has left her deputy campaign manager has left and two staffers from the campaign s online team have left _meta_end_dot_

 even die hard supporters are starting to feel antsy _meta_end_dot_

 it s not too late a lot can happen between now and march _meta_number_ref_ but i think we re going to see a lot more quotes like this one in the coming days as one democratic superdelegate who has endorsed her put it fatalistically i don t see any strategy any way that she can pull it out we heard some similar pronouncements when obama had a double digit lead a few days before the new hampshire primary _meta_end_dot_

 this is clearly worse _meta_end_dot_
