  guest post by morbo and now an update from croatia shopping on sundays has been banned kind of _meta_end_dot_

 croatia is _meta_number_ref_ percent roman catholic and the country s clerical hierarchy has been moaning for some time about the trend of people spending sundays in shopping malls instead of churches _meta_end_dot_

 a new law will go into effect jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ requiring most shops to close _meta_end_dot_

 but there are always exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 the associated press reported that sunday shopping will still be allowed during the summer and around christmas _meta_end_dot_

 we used to have these dumb sunday closing laws in the many parts of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 they are called blue laws and remnants of them still exist _meta_end_dot_

 in my area of the country for example all of the malls are open on sunday but most car dealerships are closed _meta_end_dot_

 my wife attended grad school in north carolina in the _meta_number_ref_s and noted that you could not buy wine on sunday until after _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 but laws requiring malls big box stores groceries and other retail establishments to close on sundays are pretty much kaput these days _meta_end_dot_

 what happened to them _meta_end_question_

 i once heard tv preacher pat robertson accuse the supreme court of doing in blue laws but robertson as usual was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 blue laws should have been blasted out of existence by the supreme court as a violation of church state separation but it didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court actually upheld sunday closing laws in a _meta_number_ref_ case called mcgowan v _meta_end_dot_

 maryland _meta_end_dot_

 the court majority held that blue laws might have once had a religious purpose but have since become secular merely providing a day of rest for some people _meta_end_dot_

 lame _meta_end_dot_

 what if your day of rest is not sunday _meta_end_question_

 what if you don t need or want a day of rest _meta_end_question_

 the court blithely glossed over these questions _meta_end_dot_

 despite the boost from the high court blue laws died a natural death _meta_end_dot_

 think about it _meta_end_dot_

 a total ban on buying and selling on sunday is impossible _meta_end_dot_

 restaurants need to be open for tourists and travelers _meta_end_dot_

 people need to buy gas the sunday paper medicine or other items _meta_end_dot_

 exemptions are always carved out and at that point the law becomes a joke _meta_end_dot_

 maryland s blue law for example permitted people to buy food gas medicine and newspapers but not among other items notebooks or toys _meta_end_dot_

 yet large grocery stores might easily sell all of those items _meta_end_dot_

 if the store is open and selling food what s the point of denying someone the ability to buy a notebook as well _meta_end_question_

 a little advice for the clergy of croatia if you re worried about people not coming to church on sunday don t seek to shut down the competition _meta_end_dot_

 instead do a better job preaching _meta_end_dot_
