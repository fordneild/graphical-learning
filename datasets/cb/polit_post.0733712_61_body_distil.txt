  after an unusually rough week rudy giuliani has apparently decided he can help get his campaign back on track by focusing on his economic beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 today the former mayor has an op ed in the wall street journal though it doesn t take too long to start noticing its flaws _meta_end_dot_

 here s the first paragraph yes rudy giuliani considers himself an authority on wasteful spending _meta_end_dot_

 it s an odd choice for him to make right now _meta_end_dot_

 after all we ve learned over the last several days that the former mayor spent quite a few tax dollars on security details for his wife and mistress simultaneously spent quite a few more to allow his mistress to use the nypd as a cab and dog walking service and then hid the costs in the budgets of obscure mayoral offices apparently hoping no one would notice _meta_end_dot_

 so we should elect him president giuliani argues so he can clean up dc s culture of wasteful spending um how do i put this gently even a fool wouldn t buy into such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the rest of the wsj piece is more a joke than a serious statement of policy _meta_end_dot_

 i feel comfortable calling this a lie not only because it s false but because giuliani knows it s false _meta_end_dot_

 to arrive at his number giuliani has to claim credit for tax cuts initiated by others tax cuts he opposed and in one instance he counts one tax cut twice _meta_end_dot_

 best of all giuliani includes a scuttled tax increase on his list _meta_end_dot_

 we don t consider not raising a tax a tax cut charles brescher of the city s independent budget office recently said giuliani has been confronted with reality many times since he started making the bogus claim but he still makes it _meta_end_dot_

 a few paragraphs earlier giuliani lamented the huge increase in spending that happened under a republican congress with a republican president _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is describing a series of cuts that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars all to benefit the same people who ve been lavished with tax cuts for the last seven years _meta_end_dot_

 it s so absurdly irresponsible it almost makes bush and cheney look reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 what s that going to save a few million here and there _meta_end_question_

 by making safe water a little less safe _meta_end_question_

 that won t pay for a single tax cut that won t even pay for a single day of a single tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 i assume giuliani is aware of the fact that we know he hid his sex on the city costs in budgets responsible for regulating loft apartments aiding the disabled and providing lawyers for indigent defendants right _meta_end_question_

 and he wants to emphasize transparency and accountability _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 honestly it s as if giuliani is trying to become a laughingstock _meta_end_dot_

 if only jon stewart were on the air to cover this _meta_end_dot_
