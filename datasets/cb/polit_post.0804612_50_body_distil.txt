  after barack obama s iowa victory which was oddly enough just a month ago there was no shortage of media speculation that the race for the democratic nomination was effectively over _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton had come in third she was poised to do poorly in new hampshire and she was running short on funds _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knew the race was slipping away _meta_end_dot_

 and then she won new hampshire and nevada and everyone knew she was the frontrunner again _meta_end_dot_

 and then obama cleaned her clock in south carolina and everyone knew he was in the driver s seat again _meta_end_dot_

 and then clinton won california and new jersey and everyone knew that she was still the odds on favorite to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 and now practically every factor is moving in obama s direction and everyone knows the race may very well be over _meta_end_dot_

 this item in today s wall street journal is getting some attention _meta_end_dot_

 all of this has the benefit of being true _meta_end_dot_

 but i feel like i ve read this story before in the first week in january and it proved to be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure if i were a betting man and was going to pick a candidate to win the nomination my guess would be obama _meta_end_dot_

 but that s my guess right now based on the current landscape _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen the landscape shift more than once in the last few weeks which is why the smartest move of all would be to not place any bets and wait to see what happens _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense though that much of the political world is feeling a little impatient right now _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen plenty of talk about what would happen in an obama mccain match up as if that phase of the campaign has already begun _meta_end_dot_

 there s been some speculation about obama s short list of running mates as well _meta_end_dot_

 might i recommend taking a deep breath _meta_end_question_

 clinton has a legitimate shot in wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 she s still leading in her firewall states of texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 she still has broad support among superdelegates and a desire to do whatever it takes to win _meta_end_dot_

 obama is giving inevitability a try which strikes me as a good idea given the circumstances but clinton isn t about to just fade away _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i wouldn t be the least bit surprised if after march _meta_number_ref_ the media does exactly what it did after new hampshire and write a bunch of introspective items about the echo chamber and excessively exaggerate trends _meta_end_dot_

 then the new narrative will be about the miraculous clinton comeback after the she d been left for dead by the same people who d effectively called the race _meta_end_dot_

 obviously reality is hard to overlook here _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is in a very tough spot and time isn t on her side _meta_end_dot_

 a few more headlines like the one about john lewis and the obama snowball is going to look awfully big _meta_end_dot_

 but we re not there yet _meta_end_dot_
