  there have been a series of alleged terrorist plots that the white house has claimed to have disrupted _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes bush and his team tout these thwarted plots to defend torture and sometimes it s to defend illegally tapping americans phones but the bottom line is always the same there are dangerous bad guys out there and the president is stopping them _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out most if not all of the examples of thwarted plots touted by the bush gang fall apart under scrutiny but my all time favorite has to be the seas of david cult aka the miami _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when these would be terrorists were captured the administration characterized it as an enormous victory _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after the suspects were taken into custody dick cheney personally bragged that the miami group was a very real threat then attorney general alberto gonzales was so excited he held a press conference to highlight this stunning counter terrorism success story _meta_end_dot_

 the ag said the group represented a new brand of terrorism created by the convergence of globalization and technology the justice department said the terrorists in miami intended to even blow up the sears tower in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 except the story was wildly exaggerated _meta_end_dot_

 these alleged terrorists had no weapons no bombs no expertise and no money _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t behave or operate as terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 they apparently swore an oath of allegiance to osama bin laden but because an undercover fbi infiltrator suggested the idea _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter these guys weren t even muslims but instead practiced their own hybrid religion that combined islam and christianity _meta_end_dot_

 their plots against the united states were embryonic at best the new york daily news described the group which was more a cult than a terrorist network as the _meta_number_ref_ boobs they d have trouble attacking a convenience store better yet the sears tower _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday a jury found the administration s case unpersuasive at best _meta_end_dot_

 maybe in some cases but probably not in this one _meta_end_dot_

 the fbi accused these seven people of wanting to destroy the sears tower in large part because one of the seven had once visited the building _meta_end_dot_

 indeed paul kiel reminded me of the group s ringleader _meta_end_dot_

 something to remember the next time cheney describes something as a very real threat as for the mistrial the administration reportedly will re file charges next year against six of the seven _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
