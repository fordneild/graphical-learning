  you can t give barack obama a slow hanging curve right over the middle of the plate and expect him not to swing _meta_end_dot_

 one of his top economic advisors former sen _meta_end_dot_

 phil gramm said that we re merely in a mental recession that s what he said obama said smiling _meta_end_dot_

 said we re in a mental recession he didn t say this but i guess what he meant was it s a figment of your imagination these high gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 gramm then deemed the united states and i quote a nation of whiners whoa _meta_end_dot_

 now this comes after senator mccain recently admitted that his energy proposals for the gas tax holiday and the drilling will have quote mainly psychological benefits i want all of you to know that america already has one dr _meta_end_dot_

 phil _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need another one when it comes to the economy _meta_end_dot_

 this economic downturn is not in your head _meta_end_dot_

 when people are out there losing their homes and property values are declining that s not a figment of your imagination and it isn t whining to ask the government to step in and give families some relief it s one thing to go on the attack but i ve long felt one of obama s great strengths as a candidate is his ability to use humor and frankly mockery to drive his point home _meta_end_dot_

 he s not mad at mccain and gramm he just thinks they re ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 and then of course there was mccain s response _meta_end_dot_

 i don t agree with senator gramm mccain told reporters _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that the person here in michigan that just lost his job isn t suffering from a mental recession _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the mother here in michigan and around america who s trying to get enough money to educate their children isn t whining _meta_end_dot_

 america is in great difficulty _meta_end_dot_

 we re experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others _meta_end_dot_

 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me _meta_end_dot_

 so i strongly disagree go ahead and watch both clips turn down the volume and take a guess which one is having a better day _meta_end_dot_

 as for the substance gramm may not speak for mccain but mccain has brought gramm in as his top economic advisor and there s been speculation in republican circles that gramm would be a leading candidate for treasury secretary in a mccain administration _meta_end_dot_

 mccain admits that he s ignorant about economic matters and also admits he relies on gramm s guidance on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 his comments in this sense are hardly irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 as far as mccain speaking for himself i agree which is why it s important to remember that mccain s been describing our economic downturn as psychological for the entire year _meta_end_dot_
