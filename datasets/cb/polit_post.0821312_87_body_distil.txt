  thanks to a report from the justice department s inspector general we got a better sense this week about the extraordinary and illegal efforts to politicize bush s justice department _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not forget the problem of basing employment decisions on politics went well beyond the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 charlie savage picks up on an email that went largely overlooked _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure bush didn t invent political patronage and practically all modern presidents have made at least some efforts to as savage put it impose greater political control over the federal bureaucracy but none have gone as far as this gang _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration is unprecedented in how systematic the politicization is and how it extends both across the wider organization chart and deep down within the bureaucracy professor rudalevige said _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been very consistent from day _meta_number_ref_ in learning the lessons of previous administrations and pushing those tactics to the limit focusing on the implications for the justice department paul krugman helped explain the big picture that s especially true when we recognize the fact that these politicized hiring decisions went well beyond the justice department _meta_end_dot_
