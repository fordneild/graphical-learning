  it figures doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 after _meta_number_ref_ months of campaigning primaries and caucuses in _meta_number_ref_ states a couple dozen debates and ungodly sums of money spent on campaign ads pennsylvania was poised to make a real difference _meta_end_dot_

 a landslide win by hillary clinton as predicted by initial polls in march might have fundamentally reshaped the race _meta_end_dot_

 a narrow win by hillary clinton as predicted by early exit polls released last night would have made it difficult for clinton to continue _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens _meta_end_question_

 she wins by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ a number clinton supporters round up to call it a double digit win and obama supporters round down for the opposite reason _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s victory was decisive and impressive but the margin fits nicely into that middle ground _meta_end_dot_

 it s big enough to give clinton a boost but not big enough to change the overall dynamics of the race _meta_end_dot_

 it s big enough to keep the campaign going for quite a while but not big enough to compel uncommitted superdelegates to get off the fence _meta_end_dot_

 in other words after six weeks of campaigning in the keystone state and about _meta_dollor_ref_ million of investment the democratic party is largely where it was a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 there have been plenty of surprises in the democratic race over the last several months but for a change pennsylvania seemed to go according to plan _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom oddly enough actually got this one right _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the constituencies that were expected to back clinton did so and those who were expected to back obama did so too _meta_end_dot_

 in pennsylvania clinton s constituencies are larger so she won _meta_end_dot_

 most notably the knock on obama this morning seems to be that he can t close the deal or land the knock out punch he outspent clinton by more than a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin but when the dust settled obama couldn t take advantage of the opportunity to end the democratic race once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the last several weeks have been brutal for obama _meta_end_dot_

 after wright bitter gate and lackluster debate performance he didn t make gains among clinton s working class white base but he didn t lose ground either _meta_end_dot_

 what s more clinton s path to the democratic nomination is no clearer now than it was _meta_number_ref_ hours ago _meta_end_dot_

 it s all but official that she won t catch obama among pledged delegates and the popular vote contest is quite likely to break obama s way too _meta_end_dot_

 as noam scheiber explained last night so all the talk we heard in march will continue to may and probably longer _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to hear a lot about the math vs _meta_end_dot_

 the momentum the numbers vs _meta_end_dot_

 the narrative the show must will go on _meta_end_dot_
