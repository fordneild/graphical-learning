  for quite a while john mccain had a talking point he really enjoyed you know what barack obama really should do _meta_end_question_

 he should go to iraq and see the war first hand this touched off a debate about well i m not quite sure what the debate was about _meta_end_dot_

 apparently mccain and the rnc wanted voters to believe only those who ve made regular trips to the green zone are qualified to speak on conditions in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 when the obama campaign noted that obama has had an overseas trip planned for quite some time and would visit iraq soon mccain decided this wasn t good enough after all _meta_end_dot_

 indeed yesterday mccain campaign spokesperson tucker bounds told the nyt if barack obama believes that visiting iraq and meeting with commanders will not give him any new perspective then we can only assume he s going just to smile for the cameras fascinating _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the mccain campaign is concerned obama s trip to iraq only counts if obama visits baghdad and endorses mccain s position on the war _meta_end_dot_

 in other words there are three possible scenarios here _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t visit iraq _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because apparently going to iraq is important _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama visits iraq and gains information he ll use to help shape a withdrawal policy _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because obama is supposed to visit iraq and change his mind _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama visits iraq and completely abandons his opposition to the bush mccain policy _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because obama would be inconsistent _meta_end_dot_

 and now that obama is going with choice _meta_number_ref_ mccain has a new talking point you know what barack obama really should do _meta_end_question_

 he should go to south america seriously _meta_end_dot_

 this of course would lead to three possible scenarios _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t visit south america _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because apparently going to south america is important _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama visits south america and gains information he ll use to help shape his trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because obama is supposed to visit south america and change his mind _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama visits south america and completely abandons his opposition to the bush mccain trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 this would draw criticism from mccain because obama would be inconsistent _meta_end_dot_

 note to mccain obama doesn t need a travel agent _meta_end_dot_

 these constant recommendations are getting a little insipid _meta_end_dot_
