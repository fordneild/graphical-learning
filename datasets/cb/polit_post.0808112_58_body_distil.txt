  dick cheney raised some eyebrows this week when abc news martha raddatz reminded the vp that two thirds of americans say the iraq war is not worth fighting in response cheney asked so now truth be told i found this amusing but hardly shocking _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the fact that dick cheney doesn t much care about public support for the war after five years is a dog bites man story _meta_end_dot_

 of course he doesn t care cheney never does _meta_end_dot_

 for another in fairness i think i know what the vp meant as far as he s concerned whether the war enjoys the backing of the nation or not he s convinced it s the right position _meta_end_dot_

 and since he s in authority and the rest of us aren t so seems like the predictable response _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of just accepting this reality at face value the white house has decided to spin cheney s comments in a rather silly way _meta_end_dot_

 if this is the new white house line it needs a little work _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that americans had endorsed his iraq policy by virtue of him beating john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 we had an accountability moment and that s called the _meta_number_ref_ elections bush said in an interview with the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 by bush s and perino s reasoning americans vote and then their leaders act accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 bush beat kerry so the war continued _meta_end_dot_

 but as think progress reminds us there is a small flaw in this approach _meta_end_dot_

 we had input in november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 somehow the white house has decided it didn t count _meta_end_dot_
