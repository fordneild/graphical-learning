  the presidential primary in west virginia was certainly a high profile contest but the eyes of the political world were largely focused further south where a special election in mississippi was poised to tell us a whole lot about the republicans congressional strategy for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a few months ago gop congressional leaders came up with a sure fire strategy for success _meta_end_dot_

 the republican brand had fallen apart but the party assumed it could persevere especially in red districts by nationalizing house races calling democratic candidates liberals and connecting them to barack obama and nancy pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 what could possibly go wrong _meta_end_question_

 republicans gave this a shot in march in illinois _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 the gop felt good about its chances the district had been represented by former house speaker dennis hastert r bush won the district twice by double digits and republicans have held the seat for decades _meta_end_dot_

 but when voters headed to the polls a democrat won by six points _meta_end_dot_

 they tried again in april in louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 once again the gop went into the race optimistic bush won the seat by _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ and republicans have dominated the district for decades _meta_end_dot_

 this time the democrat won by three points _meta_end_dot_

 republicans were committed to doing whatever it took to prevent their strategy from failing three times in three months _meta_end_dot_

 so when it came time for yesterday s special election in mississippi s _meta_number_ref_st a very republican district the gop pulled out all the stops to hold onto it pumping money into the race sending dick cheney down to campaign running a bunch of ads featuring jeremiah wright and using robo calls from mccain bush and the first lady _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat won by eight points _meta_end_dot_

 given the results it seems as if congressional republicans are what s the word i m looking for screwed _meta_end_dot_

 congressional republicans are reportedly panicking behind the scenes and honestly i don t blame them _meta_end_dot_

 plan a was boehner s strategy about tying dem candidates to obama and pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 this approach has gone _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_number_ref_ in three heavily republican districts the last of which the national republican congressional committee spent nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of its entire bank account to keep _meta_end_dot_

 and here s the kicker there is no plan b _meta_end_dot_

 a gop house leadership aide told the politico last week that if we don t win in mississippi i think you are going to see a lot of people running around here looking for windows to jump out of and with an eight point margin it wasn t especially close _meta_end_dot_

 nrcc chairman tom cole okla was so dejected he didn t even try to spin his failure t he political environment is such that voters remain pessimistic about the direction of the country and the republican party in general _meta_end_dot_

 i encourage all republican candidates whether incumbents or challengers to take stock of their campaigns and position themselves for challenging campaigns this fall by building the financial resources and grassroots networks that offer them the opportunity and ability to communicate energize and turn out voters this election in other words the man responsible for overseeing house republican campaigns nationwide just told every gop candidate good luck you re on your own dccc chairman chris van hollen responded to the results this way there is no district that is safe for republican candidates at first blush that may sound like hyperbole _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_end_dot_

 if dems can compete and win in these three districts they can compete and win anywhere in the country _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are not only left bloodied and confused they re also left with no answers about how to prevent a wholesale disaster in november _meta_end_dot_
