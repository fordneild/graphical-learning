  on this holiday of sorts i extend best wishes to all the dads checking in on the site today _meta_end_dot_

 in light of the occasion i thought it appropriate to note this terrific speech barack obama delivered at the apostolic church of god in chicago today _meta_end_dot_

 once in a while obama gives a speech that reminds us of his capacity to be a great national leader in washington and the political world and in a broader sense as well _meta_end_dot_

 we need to help all the mothers out there who are raising these kids by themselves the mothers who drop them off at school go to work pick up them up in the afternoon work another shift get dinner make lunches pay the bills fix the house and all the other things it takes both parents to do _meta_end_dot_

 so many of these women are doing a heroic job but they need support _meta_end_dot_

 they need another parent _meta_end_dot_

 their children need another parent _meta_end_dot_

 that s what keeps their foundation strong _meta_end_dot_

 it s what keeps the foundation of our country strong _meta_end_dot_

 i know what it means to have an absent father although my circumstances weren t as tough as they are for many young people today _meta_end_dot_

 even though my father left us when i was two years old and i only knew him from the letters he wrote and the stories that my family told i was luckier than most _meta_end_dot_

 i grew up in hawaii and had two wonderful grandparents from kansas who poured everything they had into helping my mother raise my sister and me who worked with her to teach us about love and respect and the obligations we have to one another _meta_end_dot_

 i screwed up more often than i should ve but i got plenty of second chances _meta_end_dot_

 and even though we didn t have a lot of money scholarships gave me the opportunity to go to some of the best schools in the country _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of kids don t get these chances today _meta_end_dot_

 there is no margin for error in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 so my own story is different in that way _meta_end_dot_

 still i know the toll that being a single parent took on my mother how she struggled at times to the pay bills to give us the things that other kids had to play all the roles that both parents are supposed to play _meta_end_dot_

 and i know the toll it took on me _meta_end_dot_

 so i resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle that if i could be anything in life i would be a good father to my girls that if i could give them anything i would give them that rock that foundation on which to build their lives _meta_end_dot_

 and that would be the greatest gift i could offer _meta_end_dot_

 i say this knowing that i have been an imperfect father knowing that i have made mistakes and will continue to make more wishing that i could be home for my girls and my wife more than i am right now _meta_end_dot_

 i say this knowing all of these things because even as we are imperfect even as we face difficult circumstances there are still certain lessons we must strive to live and learn as fathers whether we are black or white rich or poor from the south side or the wealthiest suburb _meta_end_dot_

 the first is setting an example of excellence for our children because if we want to set high expectations for them we ve got to set high expectations for ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 it s great if you have a job it s even better if you have a college degree _meta_end_dot_

 it s a wonderful thing if you are married and living in a home with your children but don t just sit in the house and watch sportscenter all weekend long _meta_end_dot_

 that s why so many children are growing up in front of the television _meta_end_dot_

 as fathers and parents we ve got to spend more time with them and help them with their homework and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in awhile _meta_end_dot_

 that s how we build that foundation _meta_end_dot_

 we know that education is everything to our children s future _meta_end_dot_

 we know that they will no longer just compete for good jobs with children from indiana but children from india and china and all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 we know the work and the studying and the level of education that requires _meta_end_dot_

 you know sometimes i ll go to an eighth grade graduation and there s all that pomp and circumstance and gowns and flowers _meta_end_dot_

 and i think to myself it s just eighth grade _meta_end_dot_

 to really compete they need to graduate high school and then they need to graduate college and they probably need a graduate degree too _meta_end_dot_

 an eighth grade education doesn t cut it today _meta_end_dot_

 let s give them a handshake and tell them to get their butts back in the library _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s up to us as fathers and parents to instill this ethic of excellence in our children _meta_end_dot_

 it s up to us to say to our daughters don t ever let images on tv tell you what you are worth because i expect you to dream without limit and reach for those goals _meta_end_dot_

 it s up to us to tell our sons those songs on the radio may glorify violence but in my house we live glory to achievement self respect and hard work _meta_end_dot_

 it s up to us to set these high expectations _meta_end_dot_

 and that means meeting those expectations ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 that means setting examples of excellence in our own lives _meta_end_dot_

 the second thing we need to do as fathers is pass along the value of empathy to our children _meta_end_dot_

 not sympathy but empathy the ability to stand in somebody else s shoes to look at the world through their eyes _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it s so easy to get caught up in us that we forget about our obligations to one another _meta_end_dot_

 there s a culture in our society that says remembering these obligations is somehow soft that we can t show weakness and so therefore we can t show kindness _meta_end_dot_

 but our young boys and girls see that _meta_end_dot_

 they see when you are ignoring or mistreating your wife _meta_end_dot_

 they see when you are inconsiderate at home or when you are distant or when you are thinking only of yourself _meta_end_dot_

 and so it s no surprise when we see that behavior in our schools or on our streets _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we pass on the values of empathy and kindness to our children by living them _meta_end_dot_

 we need to show our kids that you re not strong by putting other people down you re strong by lifting them up _meta_end_dot_

 that s our responsibility as fathers _meta_end_dot_

 and by the way it s a responsibility that also extends to washington _meta_end_dot_

 because if fathers are doing their part if they re taking our responsibilities seriously to be there for their children and set high expectations for them and instill in them a sense of excellence and empathy then our government should meet them halfway _meta_end_dot_

 we should be making it easier for fathers who make responsible choices and harder for those who avoid them _meta_end_dot_

 we should get rid of the financial penalties we impose on married couples right now and start making sure that every dime of child support goes directly to helping children instead of some bureaucrat _meta_end_dot_

 we should reward fathers who pay that child support with job training and job opportunities and a larger earned income tax credit that can help them pay the bills _meta_end_dot_

 we should expand programs where registered nurses visit expectant and new mothers and help them learn how to care for themselves before the baby is born and what to do after programs that have helped increase father involvement women s employment and children s readiness for school _meta_end_dot_

 we should help these new families care for their children by expanding maternity and paternity leave and we should guarantee every worker more paid sick leave so they can stay home to take care of their child without losing their income _meta_end_dot_

 we should take all of these steps to build a strong foundation for our children _meta_end_dot_

 but we should also know that even if we do even if we meet our obligations as fathers and parents even if washington does its part too we will still face difficult challenges in our lives _meta_end_dot_

 there will still be days of struggle and heartache _meta_end_dot_

 the rains will still come and the winds will still blow _meta_end_dot_

 and that is why the final lesson we must learn as fathers is also the greatest gift we can pass on to our children and that is the gift of hope _meta_end_dot_

 i m not talking about an idle hope that s little more than blind optimism or willful ignorance of the problems we face _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about hope as that spirit inside us that insists despite all evidence to the contrary that something better is waiting for us if we re willing to work for it and fight for it _meta_end_dot_

 if we are willing to believe _meta_end_dot_

 i was answering questions at a town hall meeting in wisconsin the other day and a young man raised his hand and i figured he d ask about college tuition or energy or maybe the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but instead he looked at me very seriously and he asked what does life mean to you now i have to admit that i wasn t quite prepared for that one _meta_end_dot_

 i think i stammered for a little bit but then i stopped and gave it some thought and i said this when i was a young man i thought life was all about me how do i make my way in the world and how do i become successful and how do i get the things that i want _meta_end_dot_

 but now my life revolves around my two little girls _meta_end_dot_

 and what i think about is what kind of world i m leaving them _meta_end_dot_

 are they living in a county where there s a huge gap between a few who are wealthy and a whole bunch of people who are struggling every day _meta_end_question_

 are they living in a county that is still divided by race _meta_end_question_

 a country where because they re girls they don t have as much opportunity as boys do _meta_end_question_

 are they living in a country where we are hated around the world because we don t cooperate effectively with other nations _meta_end_question_

 are they living a world that is in grave danger because of what we ve done to its climate _meta_end_question_

 and what i ve realized is that life doesn t count for much unless you re willing to do your small part to leave our children all of our children a better world _meta_end_dot_

 even if it s difficult _meta_end_dot_

 even if the work seems great _meta_end_dot_

 even if we don t get very far in our lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 that is our ultimate responsibility as fathers and parents _meta_end_dot_

 we try _meta_end_dot_

 we hope _meta_end_dot_

 we do what we can to build our house upon the sturdiest rock _meta_end_dot_

 and when the winds come and the rains fall and they beat upon that house we keep faith that our father will be there to guide us and watch over us and protect us and lead his children through the darkest of storms into light of a better day _meta_end_dot_

 that is my prayer for all of us on this father s day and that is my hope for this country in the years ahead _meta_end_dot_

 may god bless you and your children _meta_end_dot_

 thank you
