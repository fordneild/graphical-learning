  like yglesias i really have to wonder what gets into the minds of the editors of the washington post s op ed page _meta_end_dot_

 this item from writer matthew debord emphasizes the virtues of the hummer tank truck and its _meta_number_ref_ miles to the gallon fuel efficiency _meta_end_dot_

 so the hummer is obnoxious which necessarily makes it a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 responsible people abhor the ridiculousness of the vehicle which also necessarily makes it a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 regular ol americans fear a paramilitary vehicle on u s _meta_end_dot_

 streets which again necessarily makes it a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias asked what kind of value do the post s editors think this kind of thing is adding to the public conversation i m wondering the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 that may very well be true _meta_end_dot_

 but i imagine if the pentagon brought a literal tank into the auto show i assume people would love to climb into that too indulging anyone who played with g i _meta_end_dot_

 joe action figures as a kid _meta_end_dot_

 that does not however mean consumers should stop by their local car dealer to work out the financing on a brand new m_meta_number_ref_ abrams _meta_end_dot_

 remember this is meant to sound like criticism _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it s hard to know whether this op ed is a parody or not _meta_end_dot_

 so hummers are good for us precisely because they re bad for us _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure the post has published more insufferable nonsense but nothing recent comes to mind _meta_end_dot_
