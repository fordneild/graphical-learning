  the president spoke briefly this morning from the white house heralding the success of the surge for creating sustained progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 soon after joe lieberman announced that he and lindsey graham are introducing a resolution recognizing the strategic success that the surge has achieved in a central front the central front of the war on terror against the enemies who attacked america on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and expressing our thanks to our troops who ve made that success possible ben at tp did a nice job knocking this down _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 i d add that lieberman s insistence that the surge defeated the enemies who attacked america on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ also suggests he thinks al qaeda is or at least has been the principal cause of violence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that s completely wrong too _meta_end_dot_

 painfully obvious that the president started lying about al qaeda in iraq as part of a cynical approach to bolstering support for the war _meta_end_dot_

 while that was hardly unexpected the more noticeable problem was that the media started playing along with the white house s scheme and began characterizing everyone who commits an act of violence in iraq as an al qaeda terrorist _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times public editor clark hoyt eventually tackled the subject head on in a terrific column the paper took steps to make amends and news outlets have generally been more responsible about not equating all iraqi violence with aqi _meta_end_dot_

 but lieberman wants to fudge the details in the hopes that americans don t know the difference _meta_end_dot_

 if violence is down the surge worked _meta_end_dot_

 if the surge worked we ve beaten al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 it s completely wrong but it might fool those who aren t paying attention _meta_end_dot_

 there s also of course the political considerations _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman and graham mccain s two most sycophantic allies want a resolution recognizing the strategic success that the surge has achieved in a central front the central front of the war on terror against the enemies who attacked america on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and expressing our thanks to our troops who ve made that success possible the want that so barack obama will be compelled to take a position on it _meta_end_dot_

 if he opposes it because it s based on bogus and ignorant premises it s yet another cudgel for the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder will there ever be a presidential campaign for grown ups _meta_end_question_
