  once in a while i ll hear some of barack obama s detractors from both sides argue that he s been lax in offering detailing policy proposals _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never entirely understood the line of attack both the obama and clinton campaigns have been extremely forthcoming when it comes to presenting a detailed platform filled with all kinds of specifics especially compared to mr _meta_end_dot_

 vague generalities _meta_end_dot_

 the real problem of course is that it s the mccain campaign that avoids substance like the plague _meta_end_dot_

 we saw this just yesterday when mccain unveiled his healthcare proposal _meta_end_dot_

 asked about those who either can t afford or can t qualify for private insurance mccain proposed that the federal government work with states to cover those who would get left behind _meta_end_dot_

 what does work with mean _meta_end_question_

 no one knows _meta_end_dot_

 this is part of a conspicuous trend _meta_end_dot_

 tyler cowen hardly a partisan dem noted today actually i ve been wondering about that for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias noted t he gop seems to have decided to blow a not very appealing idiosyncratic element of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s personality into some kind of principled objection to policy proposals true but how did we get to this point _meta_end_question_

 second mccain is probably convinced that he can get away with a total lack of policy specifics _meta_end_dot_

 the media assumes he s a credible knowledgeable candidate by virtue of having served in congress for more than a quarter century _meta_end_dot_

 obama with less experience isn t given the benefit of the doubt so he faces more pressure to be more specific besides reporters don t want to read a bunch of white papers anyway so they aren t about to start asking mccain why he doesn t produce any _meta_end_dot_

 third details are risky _meta_end_dot_

 the more specifics a candidate offers the greater the likelihood that the proposal will draw scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain isn t getting pressed for details see point _meta_number_ref_ why bother _meta_end_question_

 to fulfill some obligations as a responsible _meta_number_ref_st century presidential candidate ready to deal with complex issues in a serious way _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth i get the sense that there s a gap in expectations _meta_end_dot_

 democrats care about how policies work republicans care about how policies feel _meta_end_dot_

 it s like republicans are the stephen colbert party quite certain there are more nerve endings in their gut than in their brain _meta_end_dot_

 if you ll forgive an obvious over simplification rank and file dems demand that their candidates demonstrate a degree of expertise and policy fluency while rank and file republicans think egg heads are elitists _meta_end_dot_

 it s why as josh patashnik noted if you listened to the republican presidential debates with the partial exception of taxation there were almost no in depth discussions of policy initiatives _meta_end_dot_

 if there were votes to be won by being detailed presumably some opportunistic candidate with an air of competence would have hammered the other candidates repeatedly for their lack of specifics _meta_end_dot_

 but that didn t happen any other thoughts on why there s a white paper gap _meta_end_question_
