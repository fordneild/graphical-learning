  i know how tiresome it can get to play one of my favorite parlor games imagine if a democrat had said this but i m trying to imagine what the response would be if say a host on air america radio told listeners how helpful it would be to democrats if people started a riot at the republican national convention _meta_end_dot_

 because that s what rush limbaugh seemed to tell his listeners this week about the democratic convention in denver _meta_end_dot_

 when callers suggested it s probably inappropriate for a radio host to call for violence at a political convention limbaugh clarified i am not inspiring or inciting riots i am dreaming of riots in denver he kept going _meta_end_dot_

 there won t be riots at our convention limbaugh said of the republican national convention _meta_end_dot_

 we don t riot _meta_end_dot_

 we don t burn our cars _meta_end_dot_

 we don t burn down our houses _meta_end_dot_

 we don t kill our children _meta_end_dot_

 we don t do half the things the american left does he concluded r iots in denver at the democratic convention will see to it we don t elect democrats _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the best damn thing that can happen to this country as far as i can think limbaugh s website told visitors screw the world _meta_end_exclamation_

 riot in denver someone at the convention commits acts of violence in order to help republicans _meta_end_dot_

 how could anyone be bothered by a major figure in republican politics pining for politically motivated violence in the united states _meta_end_question_

 and just for additional context limbaugh also reportedly spoke about how he dreams of a riot in denver in order to undermine barack obama s chances to the tune of white christmas no no racial subtext there at all _meta_end_dot_

 denver mayor john hickenlooper said anyone who would call for riots in an american city has clearly lost their bearings yes rush is just being rush there s no reason to be alarmed because the most popular entertainer in conservative media does stuff like this all the time _meta_end_dot_

 sure limbaugh said he wants to see a riot at the democratic convention but that s not a big deal because he s unhinged on the air all the time _meta_end_dot_

 as if irresponsibility is justified by additional irresponsibility _meta_end_dot_

 denver city councilman charles brown a republican and limbaugh listener told the denver post what an insult _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of political labels for any radio announcer to wish a riot on a city so his party could win that s disgraceful and it s absurd he said he has found limbaugh to be a great entertainer but he s really gone too far has he _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 will john mccain be pressed to address this _meta_end_question_

 will the republican national committee tell limbaugh he s not welcome at its convention _meta_end_question_

 will this have any bearing at all on whether far right republican officials from both ends of pennsylvania avenue appear on his show _meta_end_question_

 it seems highly unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 now try to imagine what would happen if a prominent democratic voice did the same thing _meta_end_dot_
