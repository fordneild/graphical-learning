  as far as i can tell rush limbaugh is more than just a right wing entertainer he s like a kid who can t get enough attention _meta_end_dot_

 if so the talk radio clown must be loving life right about now _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday apparently limbaugh s pre super tuesday tirade was aimed almost exclusively at tearing mccain down arguing among other things that he has lied about his reason for opposing the bush tax cuts limbaugh added i think mccain has an animus toward the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 i think ever since south carolina _meta_number_ref_ he s had it in for the republican party and one of his objectives is to destroy it and change it limbaugh went on to say that mccain stabbed his own president in the back on legislation a number of times _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t support his party or his president when the chips are down _meta_end_dot_

 he called people who want to protect the border racists nativists protectionists and worse _meta_end_dot_

 and what kind of character is it that tries to slide all that through under cover of darkness in a back room it s reached the point that the campaign finds it necessary to respond _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday bob dole implored limbaugh to go easy or at least easier on the senator _meta_end_dot_

 dole s letter seems to be getting quite a bit of attention but i can t help but find the whole thing a little odd _meta_end_dot_

 does bob dole suddenly carry weight with limbaugh and the gop base _meta_end_question_

 does the mccain campaign realize that press stunts like this only bring attention to the fact that mccain has struggled badly to connect with the far right activists who serve as the party s footsoldiers _meta_end_question_

 for what it s worth dole s letter doesn t seem to be winning over some of mccain s far right critics _meta_end_dot_

 malkin wrote hey bob dole get back in your cage a sentiment that seemed rather common _meta_end_dot_

 another far right blogger said john mccain is bob dole minus the charm conservatism and youth ouch i get the sense bob dole won t help mccain solve his base problem _meta_end_dot_

 call it a hunch _meta_end_dot_
