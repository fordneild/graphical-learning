  disgraced former house majority leader tom delay has been making noises for a couple of years now about creating his own moveon org for the right activist group which presumably would offer him a vehicle for well whatever it is delay does _meta_end_dot_

 last november he made it official launching the coalition for a conservative majority since then the group has had a real impact by well there was the one time it _meta_end_dot_

 the ccm certainly made a splash when the group _meta_end_dot_

 ok no one s heard a word from delay s outfit since it started begging for cash last year _meta_end_dot_

 but bob novak reported today that delay is still out there pushing his little group and imploring right wing activists to send him a check _meta_end_dot_

 yes this is what delay has been reduced to _meta_end_dot_

 the former house majority leader wants people to believe as tom tancredo lou dobbs and ron paul fear that u s _meta_end_dot_

 borders will be dissolved and we ll have one big continental country _meta_end_dot_

 but if unhinged conservatives send the former exterminator a check delay will step up to take on the powerful forces inside our government i know there are going to be some people who actually run for their checkbook after getting delay s letter but i just can t imagine what they re thinking _meta_end_dot_
