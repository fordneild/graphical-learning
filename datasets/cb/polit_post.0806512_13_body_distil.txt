  by any reasonable measure the primary excitement this week and for the next couple of months is on the democratic side of the aisle with the battle of the titans poised to continue on through the convention _meta_end_dot_

 but i d be remiss if i neglected to mention that the republican race is officially over and john mccain is the last man standing _meta_end_dot_

 he s been the presumptive nominee for a while now but it looks like we can drop the pretense and qualifier _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s republican contests were not at all competitive _meta_end_dot_

 mccain won by large margins in each of the four contests including texas by _meta_number_ref_ points notable because huckabee actually tried to win there _meta_end_dot_

 the gop exit polls though were not especially encouraging for mccain even now _meta_end_dot_

 republicans voters who described themselves as very conservative supported huckabee again _meta_end_dot_

 seven in _meta_number_ref_ republicans said they d be satisfied with mccain as the party s general election candidate but given that he d just wrapped up the nomination one imagines the mccain campaign would have preferred to see that number much higher _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the next step is the official coronation from bush _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_end_dot_

 the event will apparently go something like this _meta_end_dot_

 given that a key component of the dems general election strategy is tying mccain to bush pictures from today s white house event will likely be seen again and again _meta_end_dot_

 finally i thought i d pause to note that mike huckabee proved to be an immensely entertaining right wing candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he presented a horrifying policy agenda premised in part on changing the constitution to bring it into line with god s will and he gave most of the conservative movement heart palpitations at the thought he might get the nomination but he was probably never a serious threat to anyone _meta_end_dot_

 and he was always quite charming on colbert _meta_end_dot_

 i ll always remember him for wanting to quarantine aids patients _meta_end_dot_

 and for claiming to be god s anointed presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and for being the first presidential candidate to ever mention christ in a tv commercial _meta_end_dot_

 the thing i always liked about huckabee was his honesty _meta_end_dot_

 there weren t any surprises from this guy he was a transparently theocratic candidate _meta_end_dot_

 there was no real wink wink here huckabee laid it out there for all to see on matters of faith he s a right wing evangelical creationist who has admitted publicly that he wants to help take the nation back for christ it was always better for americans to see that and evaluate those beliefs accordingly than for huckabee to believe this and keep his agenda under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t work out obviously and huckabee was more of a regional candidate than a national player _meta_end_dot_

 so long mike we knew you a little too well _meta_end_dot_
