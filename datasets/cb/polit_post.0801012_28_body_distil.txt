  i m generally skeptical of the notion that candidate endorsements even from big name figures translate to a significant number of votes _meta_end_dot_

 but this one is nevertheless pretty interesting _meta_end_dot_

 some media outlets have characterized this as a major setback for john edwards who of course was kerry s running mate just four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but did anyone seriously believe that kerry would back edwards this year _meta_end_question_

 the two were a relatively awkward pair in _meta_number_ref_ and when edwards questioned kerry s campaign strategy after their narrow defeat the two weren t exactly on good terms _meta_end_dot_

 regardless i look at this as a pretty significant boost for obama if not in votes than at least in stature _meta_end_dot_

 kerry is arguably one of only a handful of national democratic leaders and a member in good standing of the democratic establishment most of which is backing hillary clinton in the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i mentioned on tuesday that most of the senate dems _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ had not endorsed anyone in the presidential race and to keep an eye on which direction the caucus went in _meta_end_dot_

 if kerry is any indication it might signal a shift in obama s direction _meta_end_dot_

 added that sounds right to me _meta_end_dot_

 this coupled with kerry s fundraising network should pay dividends _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
