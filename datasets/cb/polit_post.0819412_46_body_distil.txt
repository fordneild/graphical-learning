  i wasn t especially excited when newsweek said barack obama enjoyed a _meta_number_ref_ point lead over john mccain three weeks ago and i m not especially discouraged now that newsweek shows obama leading by three now _meta_end_dot_

 the news wasn t all bad for obama _meta_end_dot_

 the same poll showed that _meta_percent_ref_ of his backers support him strongly while for mccain the numbers are reversed _meta_percent_ref_ of his backers don t support him strongly the number to keep an eye on though was the switch among independents in the new poll mccain leads obama among independents _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent with _meta_number_ref_ percent favoring neither candidate _meta_end_dot_

 in june s newsweek poll obama bested mccain among independent voters _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent this frankly seems hard to believe _meta_end_dot_

 i know the media mccain attacks about obama s alleged flip flops have been an aggressive part of the discourse but it s just not realistic to think there s been this big a swing among independents in such a short time _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if the newsweek poll felt like an outlier in june because obama s lead appeared too big this latest newsweek poll also feels like an outlier because his lead is too small _meta_end_dot_

 gallup numbers for example show obama leading by six _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ his biggest margin in a month _meta_end_dot_

 and the latest cnn poll of polls has obama up by eight _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s lead has grown a bit over the course of the past month _meta_end_dot_

 it is still relatively slim but it is certainly solid cnn senior political researcher alan silverleib said _meta_end_dot_

 the burden is on mccain to find a way to shake things up as we enter the traditional summer doldrums and the latest pew research center poll has obama up by eight _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the moral of the story polls are going to show some fluctuations _meta_end_dot_

 don t take them too seriously _meta_end_dot_

 post script and by the way the same newsweek poll added this to my mind there are only a couple of ways obama can lose in november _meta_end_dot_

 the preponderance of foolish people who believe nonsense is one of them _meta_end_dot_
