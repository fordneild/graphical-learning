  on friday afternoon john mccain told a national television audience that he thought a _meta_number_ref_ month withdrawal timetable for u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq as embraced by barack obama and nouri al maliki sounds like a pretty good timetable yesterday speaking to reporters in london obama mentioned how delighted he is to see the republican establishment come around to his way of thinking _meta_end_dot_

 you ll notice that obama used the word convergence twice _meta_end_dot_

 it s subtle but obama is making a very reasonable case based on recent developments we re seeing a growing consensus about what kind of foreign policy vision works and it s the vision obama has been emphasizing all along _meta_end_dot_

 the media spent a couple of weeks running around with their hair on fire screaming that obama was shifting on foreign policy when in fact reporters had been spun backwards obama stayed the same and the establishment started coming to him _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense obama s comments in london were i hope a campaign theme we ll be hearing more of for all the far right talk about obama s inexperience on foreign affairs and national security republicans have decided that the rookie has been right from the start _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the inverse is also true _meta_end_dot_

 makes the case that mccain s message has been largely turned on its head _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain is running on a platform that was hard to predict as recently as a couple of months ago _meta_end_dot_

 when you think about it there s just nothing left _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t run on the economy he doesn t know anything about it and he embraces the identical policies of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush who got us in this mess in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 he can t run on his vision for the future he doesn t have one _meta_end_dot_

 he can t run on his senate record because he s flip flopped on practically every issue imaginable _meta_end_dot_

 and now mccain can t even run on foreign policy because he s suddenly discovered how much he likes obama s afghanistan policy and the obama maliki withdrawal timetable _meta_end_dot_

 so what s left _meta_end_question_

 obama is a treasonous socialist who hates the military _meta_end_dot_

 it s genuinely pathetic but mccain doesn t see any alternatives _meta_end_dot_
