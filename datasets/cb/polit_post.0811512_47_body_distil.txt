  there are a variety of annoying angles to the democratic presidential race but one of the more jarring elements is the fact that we re seeing the same arguments played out over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 some of these questions have been played out repeatedly and yet we seem to forget the particulars _meta_end_dot_

 at the top of the list is the notion that primary results are a reliable predictor of general election results _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate win s a state s primary the argument goes it means he or she is more likely to win it in november _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate loses a primary he or she is likely to lose the state in november _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been down this road before and apparently we re headed down it again _meta_end_dot_

 there are compelling reasons to vote for clinton but this isn t one of them _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt noted for example that exit polling and independent political analysts offer evidence that mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama could do just as well as mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton among blocs of voters with whom he now runs behind _meta_end_dot_

 obama advisers say he also appears well positioned to win swing states and believe he would have a strong shot at winning traditional republican states like virginia _meta_end_dot_

 according to surveys of pennsylvania voters leaving the polls on tuesday mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama would draw majorities of support from lower income voters and less educated ones just as mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton would against mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain even though those voters have favored her over mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama in the primaries moreover when it comes to predictive indicators state primary results do not necessarily translate into general election victories jeff greenfield had a good item about this back on march _meta_number_ref_ i mention the date only to emphasize how long we ve been mulling over the same topic which noted that primary results cannot provide a guide to the fall campaign jonathan chait added yesterday and josh marshall and the tpm team pored over some of the available data _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect this will remain a lingering question but it shouldn t _meta_end_dot_
