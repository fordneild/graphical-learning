  for the past several weeks john mccain and his campaign have been enraged by the emphasis on his willingness to leave u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for up to _meta_number_ref_ years and the audacity of democrats to tell voters about his views on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 to hear them tell it misrepresenting a rival s stated policy position which dems really aren t doing is completely beyond the pale _meta_end_dot_

 which is odd given mccain s habit of wildly misrepresenting the dems on healthcare policy _meta_end_dot_

 on a campaign stop on thursday for example mccain said clinton and obama want a massive government takeover of the health care system in america a few months ago mccain said the dems offer a single payer big government solution a few months before that he insisted that the dems are offering a government run single payer system like they have in canada and like they have in england now it s worth noting that john mccain doesn t know the first thing about healthcare other than the fact that he s enjoyed generous quality taxpayer financed medical care for his entire life _meta_end_dot_

 given his almost humiliating confusion on most policy details mccain might actually believe his own bogus talking points _meta_end_dot_

 he s not necessarily lying it s just as likely that he s clueless _meta_end_dot_

 whether his deception is intentional or not is however beside the point _meta_end_dot_

 after decrying misrepresentations mccain can t bring himself to tell the truth about one of the most important domestic policy issues on the mind of americans _meta_end_dot_

 i see _meta_end_dot_

 the finite extent is a terrific euphemism isn t it _meta_end_question_

 perhaps i can translate bounds conclusion from spin to english if we consider what the dems have actually said mccain is lying _meta_end_dot_

 but those are just details _meta_end_dot_

 since we think the dems plans might someday kinda sorta lead to something like single payer we feel comfortable lying some more my very favorite quote though came when mccain said people in a single payer system end up in a two tiered system where the wealthiest can afford to pay for their own health care and those with low income sometimes wait six or eight months for a routine kind of treatment _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what i m not going to let happen to the united states of america right _meta_end_dot_

 of course _meta_end_dot_

 we can t possibly tolerate a two tiered system in which those with more money get more care and lower income families get screwed _meta_end_dot_

 no that would be awful _meta_end_dot_

 we can t let that happen in the united states of america _meta_end_dot_
