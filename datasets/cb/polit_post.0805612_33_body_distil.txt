  back in october a nationally known print journalist told harpers scott horton i ve never seen anything quite like this _meta_end_dot_

 everything i ve been told by the convicted defendants checks out as the gospel truth _meta_end_dot_

 and everything i m told by federal prosecutors who pushed the case turns out either to be an outrageous lie or at least a very serious distortion _meta_end_dot_

 and the local journalists who wrote the most about the case all behave like they re accessories after the fact in a criminal investigation the journalist was describing the don siegelman case in alabama and doing a pretty good job of it _meta_end_dot_

 there s been quite a bit of buzz in recent weeks about the report _meta_number_ref_ minutes had been preparing on the controversy and after having seen it i m delighted cbs has made it available for embedding _meta_end_dot_

 please take a few minutes even if you ve heard the siegelman story before to take a look _meta_end_dot_

 noted and here s the gem to end all gems the local station is you guessed it owned by a family that contributes heavily to the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
