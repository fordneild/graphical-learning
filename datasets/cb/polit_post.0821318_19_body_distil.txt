  as expected the mccain campaign s new tv ad comparing barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton made quite a splash yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 when pressed for a reaction obama told reporters yesterday you know i don t pay attention to john mccain s ads although i do notice he doesn t seem to have anything to say very positive about himself _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what he s for and not just what he s against that s not bad i suppose but as greg sargent noted yesterday hearing obama himself laugh off the ad as childish or babyish would help ensure that mccain just keeps on shrinkin with that in mind today s response at a town hall meeting on energy in cedar rapids iowa seemed quite a bit stronger _meta_end_dot_

 much better _meta_end_dot_

 interesting piece _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan chait isn t going for the racial angle arguing instead that mccain s team picked spears and hilton because they re extremely unpopular celebrities maybe but mccain having hired the minds behind the call me attack ad against harold ford might tip the scales a bit _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the mccain campaign s spin has become increasingly ridiculous and even tougher to defend _meta_end_dot_

 leading conservative blogers hate it mccain allies hate it and the obama campaign is mocking it _meta_end_dot_

 so when mccain spokesperson nicolle wallace a rove acolyte appeared on the today show to talk about it what was her message _meta_end_question_

 this ad is in some ways a celebration of obama s celebrity good lord _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry while even mccain s paid staff is struggling to defend one of the stupidest presidential campaign ads in recent history there s still joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 relax and enjoy it hilton and spears _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
