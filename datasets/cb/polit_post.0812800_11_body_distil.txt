  late last week hillary clinton seemed to be taking something of a risk raising expectation in north carolina telling voters this primary election on tuesday is a game changer _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to make a huge difference in what happens going forward _meta_end_dot_

 the entire country probably even a lot of the world is looking to see what north carolina decides in retrospect that probably wasn t the best idea _meta_end_dot_

 within a few minutes of the polls closing in north carolina all of the major networks called the state for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the speed with which the state was called suggests the margin was pretty comfortable for the illinois senator _meta_end_dot_

 abc news already labeled it a rout as for indiana with about a fourth of the precincts reporting clinton is cruising with a double digit lead though as i understand it most of the data is coming from rural areas where obama was expected to do especially poorly _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
