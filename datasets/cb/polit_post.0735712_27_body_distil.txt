  one of the striking things about the large field of republican presidential candidates is just how diverse it is _meta_end_dot_

 no not in the traditional sense of diversity they re all wealthy middle aged christian white guys but in the sense there s a candidate for the various factions of the party _meta_end_dot_

 some have decades of experience in washington some have experience at the state level _meta_end_dot_

 some have a strong business background some have a strong military background _meta_end_dot_

 there are governors senators house members an actor and a mayor _meta_end_dot_

 there are candidates from the west coast east coast bible belt midwest southwest and new england _meta_end_dot_

 the neocons are represented giuliani as are the theocons huckabee the know nothings tancredo the libertarians paul and whatever the hell mccain and romney are this week _meta_end_dot_

 given all of these choices it s amazing that a huge field like this has apparently driven the entire party into fits of frustration not at the difficulty in picking among strong candidates but in realizing that their seven remaining candidates are probably best described as the seven dwarves none of whom can bring the party together _meta_end_dot_

 i don t imagine the republicans would be willing to just skip the nominating process and let gop voters write in their favorite next november but given the widespread disappointment they might as well _meta_end_dot_

 you ll notice of course that this equation omits fred thompson who is at least marginally a top tier candidate and who probably could have been the one guy with no glaring gop flaws were it not for the fact that he apparently doesn t want to actually run for president _meta_end_dot_

 best of all the party is receiving very little help from the top where george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is a weight on the party s shoulders and a name practically verboten among leading gop contenders _meta_end_dot_

 traditionally an incumbent retiring president can help establish a path for his party to follow _meta_end_dot_

 not so much this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to overstate how entertaining it is to see the party that relies almost exclusively on unity wander aimlessly with no direction or leadership _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this could change once there s a democratic nominee republicans can rally in opposition to _meta_end_dot_

 but what does it say about the modern republican party that they need a dem to save their electoral chances _meta_end_question_
