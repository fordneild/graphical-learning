  guest post by morbo increasingly erratic syndicated columnist richard cohen wants someone to just tell me one thing barack obama has done that you admire ok i m up for fielding that one _meta_end_dot_

 how about he stood up boldly and without apology and powerfully articulated a progressive vision for this country better than i ve heard anyone do in my lifetime _meta_end_question_

 moreover cohen s premise that obama hasn t done anything admirable is also mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 obsidian wings hilzoy has written a couple of very strong items here and here about a great number of things obama has done which should more than satisfy cohen s curiosity _meta_end_dot_

 but in some ways cohen s request is the wrong question _meta_end_dot_

 it s not so much what obama has done that interests me _meta_end_dot_

 it s what he s going to do if we re smart enough to elect him _meta_end_dot_

 to wit obama will implement a foreign policy based on collaboration with our allies and tough minded negotiation when necessary as opposed to cowboy antics and constant war _meta_end_dot_

 obama will restore our nation s standing in the international community _meta_end_dot_

 obama will bring our troops home from iraq instead of keeping them there for the next _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 obama will take global climate change seriously and make america a leader in this field instead of a prominent denier of a reality the rest of the civilized world long ago acknowledged _meta_end_dot_

 obama will spearhead efforts toward real energy independence instead of just leaving us at the mercy of autocratic middle eastern despots and their enablers in the international criminal conspiracy known as big oil _meta_end_dot_

 obama will end the national shame of state sanctioned torture as official government policy and will stop indefinite detention of people charged with no crime _meta_end_dot_

 obama will put grown ups in the charge of the economy not rapacious robber barons or those who embrace magical thinking and insist tax cuts pay for themselves obama will advocate for the americans who most need help the middle class and below _meta_end_dot_

 obama won t refer to tax dodging plutocrats as my base obama will make us proud to be americans again _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have a president who is intellectual curious and engaged as opposed to a bull headed dithering underachiever the mention of whose very name makes one cringe _meta_end_dot_

 does that answer your question dick _meta_end_question_
