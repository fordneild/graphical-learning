  i suspect all politicians to some extent are concerned with their personal appearance but this example from texas _meta_number_ref_nd is simply hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 hrbacek s campaign manager scott broschart conceded that the image is a fake but said the candidate has just been so busy meeting voters that he didn t have time to have his picture taken for the mailing _meta_end_dot_

 broschart added that the flap is unimportant because voters are more concerned with the issues as opposed to pretty photo shoots somehow i have a hunch this defense won t work _meta_end_dot_

 john bresnahan added i love this guy already and hope he wins the gop nomination to take on lampson _meta_end_dot_

 it will be too much fun agreed _meta_end_dot_

 any campaign that would pull a stunt like this is bound to be the gift that keeps on giving _meta_end_dot_
