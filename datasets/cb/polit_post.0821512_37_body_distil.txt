  school vouchers haven t had any luck at all lately _meta_end_dot_

 voters in utah expected to be rather conservative overwhelmingly rejected a statewide ballot referendum on vouchers last november _meta_end_dot_

 the president touted a voucher plan in his state of the union address which was doa in congress _meta_end_dot_

 a study of the milwaukee system found that students who receive vouchers to go to private schools don t do any better academically than those stuck in public schools _meta_end_dot_

 the voucher system in the district of columbia created by congressional republicans to be the first ever federally funded voucher program has had it especially rough _meta_end_dot_

 last fall we learned that after congress handed over tax dollars to unregulated private schools without conditions lawmakers ended up financing unaccredited schools unsuitable learning environments schools with no operating permits and schools where teachers didn t even have bachelor s degrees _meta_end_dot_

 worse yet a report from the administration released a month ago found that students in dc who received vouchers didn t do any better academically either _meta_end_dot_

 so it s odd that one of the very few substantive lines of attack john mccain is making against barack obama is over the issue of school vouchers _meta_end_dot_

 specifically mccain told the national urban league democrats in congress including my opponent oppose the d c _meta_end_dot_

 opportunity scholarship program _meta_end_dot_

 in remarks to the american federation of teachers last month senator obama dismissed public support for private school vouchers for low income americans as tired rhetoric about vouchers and school choice all of that went over well with the teachers union but where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools the substance of all of this is completely wrong but the politics is just odd _meta_end_dot_

 indeed when bush took office and started working with lawmakers on no child left behind the white house initially proposed a voucher system but decided not to put up a fight over it _meta_end_dot_

 congress balked at the idea and bush dropped it like a hot potato figuring it wasn t worth fighting over a policy that a lawmakers wouldn t budge on and b the public didn t like anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he we are seven years later and the centerpiece of mccain s education policy is vouchers that s a fight obama should certainly welcome _meta_end_dot_

 mccain told his audience yesterday everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama did that s a common argument _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his wife are extraordinarily wealthy and they decided to pay tuition to send at least some of their kids to private schools _meta_end_dot_

 i say some because it s unclear if mccain also sent his children from his first marriage to private schools or only those from his second marriage mccain believes he like other wealthy people have a choice so lower income families should have the same choice i m curious though whether mccain is determined to limit this to schooling _meta_end_dot_

 the mccains have a choice about the kind of healthcare coverage their family enjoys _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain doesn t believe lower income families should have the same choice indeed wealthy families like the mccains have all kinds of choices about the kind of homes they own cars they drive food they eat _meta_end_dot_

 those with money even have a choice about the kind of political influence they can buy with generous campaign donations _meta_end_dot_

 if i understand mccain properly though he opposes vouchers for healthcare homes cars food and campaign contributions apparently because it s not important whether lower income families have the same choices in these areas as the mccains have _meta_end_dot_

 where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools well for one thing we could do more to fix those schools that don t measure up _meta_end_dot_

 but i d also ask mccain where his policies leave families and their children who are stuck without health insurance _meta_end_question_

 or without housing _meta_end_question_

 or who struggle to get where they need to go on public transporation _meta_end_question_

 mccain supports vouchers for schools in large part because he wants to privatize the system _meta_end_dot_

 that s his right but let s not pretend this has anything to do with john mccain s deep concern for the plight of families with less money than his _meta_end_dot_
