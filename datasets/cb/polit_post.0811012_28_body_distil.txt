  there s always been at least some tension between hillary clinton and the democratic party s activist base _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is perceived as something of a moderate reluctant to fight aggressively for progressive causes and who backed the war in iraq without conceding the mistake _meta_end_dot_

 but if the hostility was awkward before it s about to get considerably worse _meta_end_dot_

 the huffington post reported last night on remarks clinton delivered at a closed door fundraiser after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 an obtained audio recording it s unclear precisely where or when the fundraiser was held highlighted clinton blaming democratic party activists for her electoral difficulties _meta_end_dot_

 last week the huffpost reported on clinton saying screw em in reference to working class whites in the south _meta_end_dot_

 the story was largely dismissed and as i argued it probably wasn t too big a deal anyway _meta_end_dot_

 but getting caught trashing the activist base of the democratic party is far more problematic especially while running for the democratic party s presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 indeed clinton s comments at the fundraiser reflect a certain disdain for liberal activists and hints at a rift between the base and the clinton campaign that will be difficult to repair _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton s comments went considerably further dismissing the activist base of the party rejecting their positions on foreign policy and accusing them of intimidation tactics _meta_end_dot_

 what s more she adopted a rather elitist attitude t hat s what we re dealing with who is we _meta_end_question_

 the party elites who find the activist base an annoyance _meta_end_question_

 and why exactly is high turnout among democratic activists in primaries and caucuses a bad thing _meta_end_question_

 and when clinton said i don t agree with them in relation to the foreign policy and national security positions embraced by the party s base what was she referring to _meta_end_question_

 presumably this has to go well beyond afghanistan since most dems supported the launch of the war in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 worse clinton at least publicly has had very complimentary things to say about moveon org which her comments at the fundraiser contradict _meta_end_dot_

 in april at a moveon sponsored town hall event clinton praised party activists who refuse to back down i think you have helped to change the face of american politics for the better both online and in the corridors of power _meta_end_dot_

 so although some of your members may be a little surprised to hear me say this i am grateful for your work clinton communications director howard wolfson confirmed the authenticity of the recording and said when clinton referred to obama supporters who intimidate people she was referring to instances of intimidation in the nevada and the texas caucuses regrettably wolfson s argument turned out to be false as the huffington post s celeste fremon noted in fact the nevada caucuses occurred prior to moveon s endorsement of obama and when clinton made her remarks the texas caucuses had yet to take place realistically it seems unlikely to me that this story will generate anywhere near the interest that bitter gate did _meta_end_dot_

 given the political landscape awkwardly worded concerns about bitter people in small towns is explosive and trashing liberal activists isn t _meta_end_dot_

 regardless whether her remarks prompt weeks of ads and op eds or not the democratic base will hear about this they largely already have and it will create lingering resentment _meta_end_dot_

 i m not even sure what clinton or her aides could say to help alleviate the situation _meta_end_dot_

 and just as an aside i d like to extend some advice to every presidential candidate currently running or who will ever run in the future it s the _meta_number_ref_st century and phones cameras and microphones are everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 you may not like it but if you re a high profile political leader the words you use around others while on the campaign trail will be recorded _meta_end_dot_

 something to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_
