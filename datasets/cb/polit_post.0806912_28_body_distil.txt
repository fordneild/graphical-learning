  following up on an item from last weekend the washington post for reasons that defy comprehension published a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word thought piece a week ago on women in america being dumb shallow and generally kind of pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 the author charlotte allen made her spectacularly dumb case arguing that women are bad drivers they have physically smaller brains they re awful at math they have bad taste in entertainment etc _meta_end_dot_

 women allen concluded without a hint of irony are the stupid sex embarrassing and kind of dim the problem i argued is not allen _meta_end_dot_

 her foolish attack on women is easy to dismiss as petty nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 instead the fault lies with washington post editors who thought allen s anti feminist hit job deserved to be published on the front page of the paper s outlook section _meta_end_dot_

 a few days ago the wapo s outlook editor took a moment to respond to criticism saying the piece was intended to be tongue in cheek today post ombudsman deborah howell added some insightful thoughts on the subject conceding that she was offended by allen s opinion piece which she called breathtaking and insulting all true _meta_end_dot_

 but it leads back to the central question how did allen s nonsense get published in the first place _meta_end_question_

 howell offers some insights on this as well _meta_end_dot_

 this is all good to know but in some ways makes the incident all the more bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 all of these editors including six women read a shallow cliched hit piece on all american women and thought it belonged on the front page of the opinion section of one of the nation s leading newspapers _meta_end_question_

 i had assumed there had been some breakdown in the editing process and somehow a clunker had sneaked through without scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 apparently not _meta_end_dot_

 the editors actually thought this was thought provoking _meta_end_dot_

 attacking women for having small brains deficient driving skills poor taste weak math skills and underwhelming intellects represents satirical self criticism and self examination _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 to be sure it appears the post probably realizes a week too late that this was an awful mistake which insulted most of its readers of both genders _meta_end_dot_

 one assumes the outlook assignment editor in retrospect probably looks at allen s piece today with a more critical eye and will be a little more cautious about giving the green light to similar hit pieces in the future _meta_end_dot_

 this has been as pomfret put it a learning experience i should hope so _meta_end_dot_
