  the general services administration generally isn t one of those departments that captures the public s attention _meta_end_dot_

 the gsa is by design a behind the scenes agency it helps other parts of the government function by managing federal contracts _meta_end_dot_

 in recent years however the gsa has found itself under the spotlight after the white house tried to exploit the agency for republican campaign efforts with the dubious participation of gsa chief lurita doan _meta_end_dot_

 a year after the controversy first broke and with the white house having already used her doan was shown the door _meta_end_dot_

 investigators already concluded that doan violated the hatch act last year when she pressed political appointees how they could help our candidates at a gsa briefing conducted by karl rove s office _meta_end_dot_

 that she hadn t been fired sooner is a reflection of the administration s tolerance for corruption and unethical behavior _meta_end_dot_

 refreshes our memories _meta_end_dot_

 matters took a turn for the worse when doan was found to have violated the hatch act worse still when it appeared she retaliated against gsa employees who cooperated with office of special counsel s investigation of her partisan activities and even worse still when she approved a no bid business deal for one of her friend s companies _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add one thing to paul s report when congressional democrats started to go after doan for her apparent corruption house republicans accused dems of being racist doan is african american _meta_end_dot_

 in one especially disgusting display rep _meta_end_dot_

 chris shays r conn said i find that when an african american is a republican somehow she is treated differently by congress in any event so long lurita _meta_end_dot_

 we knew you far too well _meta_end_dot_
