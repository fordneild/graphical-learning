  i admit it i m a sucker for stories about record breaking turnouts in democratic primaries and caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 it s been going on for a month and it continued in full force yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 dan savage in seattle compared the scene to images from a horror movie _meta_end_dot_

 now savage s larger point was that this kind of pandemonium wouldn t be entirely necessary if washington would just break down and host a primary instead of a caucus but the point about turnout is nevertheless is important dems participated in droves _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ showed up for the state s democratic caucuses which at the time broke a washington record _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday that number was nearly doubled _meta_end_dot_

 i also enjoyed this take from nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 all of this of course keeps with the recent trend _meta_end_dot_

 noted today no matter which dem you love or loathe it s easy to take some comfort in knowing that rank and file democrats in practically every state are excited about this election _meta_end_dot_
