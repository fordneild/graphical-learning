  way back in january the washington post ran a front page piece documenting barack obama s admitted experimentation with drugs as a teenager _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece didn t exactly break new ground but the article concluded that obama s bad choices including drug use starting in high school and ending in college are sure to receive new scrutiny the political world responded with a collective yawn _meta_end_dot_

 obama had not only acknowledged drug use three decades ago he wrote about it extensively in an autobiography _meta_end_dot_

 unanswered questions pique reporters interest already answered questions are a lot less interesting _meta_end_dot_

 no one on either side of the aisle found any of this compelling and the issue has barely been a blip on the radar since _meta_end_dot_

 that is until someone in new hampshire asked obama about it yesterday sparking a new round of media interest _meta_end_dot_

 obama explained that he got really serious in college realized he wasted his time in high school and began to get himself on track _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i was so serious that my mother told me to lighten up because i d become a complete grind fortunately over time i got a little balanced he said _meta_end_dot_

 the audience seemed to appreciate obama s honesty and willingness to be candid about his youthful mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 but mitt romney wasn t impressed calling obama s remarks a huge mistake please _meta_end_dot_

 are we really going to make this race about what candidates did as teenagers _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_question_

 what would romney have obama do lie to students and school officials about things he s already written about _meta_end_question_

 for that matter by romney s logic george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush must be the worst president of all time because no one could possibly be a worse role model goof off through high school goof off through college experiment with drugs become an alcoholic get arrested lie about getting arrested fail in one venture after another basically coast through life while relying on a famous last name through his _meta_number_ref_s and then seek high public office _meta_end_dot_

 and romney s worried that obama might not be a good role model _meta_end_question_

 i m actually at a loss to understand why the media jumped on this story at all yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose reporters occasionally need something new to talk about but i kind of thought we d moved past youthful indiscretions indeed obama s admissions show a certain political maturity on the nation s part most americans simply no longer care what presidential candidates did as teenagers _meta_end_dot_

 the really interesting response however came from rudy giuliani who was far more forgiving than romney _meta_end_dot_

 that s a smart line to take given giuliani s personal scandals _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s personal activities as a high school student are on the table giuliani might as well drop out now _meta_end_dot_

 that said isn t it a little unfair for giuliani to suggest his mistakes are comparable to obama s _meta_end_question_

 after all obama experimented with drugs while in high school _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s personal scandals include marching in a parade with his mistress at age _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 part of dismissing youthful indiscretions is the understanding that they happened during someone s youth _meta_end_dot_
