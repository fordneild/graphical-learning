  when republicans lost three special election house races this year in three traditionally red districts held by republicans the party thought it might be a good time to re think its election year strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the original plan was to nationalize the elections tie democratic house candidates to barack obama and nancy pelosi and scream liberal a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 that obviously wasn t much of a plan and when it failed in a place like mississippi republicans realized it was time for a re evaluation _meta_end_dot_

 now conservative candidates are being urged to follow a very different tack _meta_end_dot_

 the playbook added that republican candidates should develop an issues matrix that is different than in years past the party lost its special elections in the spring because its candidates failed to successfully establish themselves and their local brand in contrast to the negative perception of the national gop to summarize the message is effectively stop doing what we ve been doing which given the republicans minority status the house republican caucus is down to _meta_number_ref_ members is probably a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 it s striking though to see the advice in action _meta_end_dot_

 in some instances republicans no longer even want to tell voters which party they belong to _meta_end_dot_

 a report from washington state where some statewide republican candidates are running without that pesky r word next to their names this really is embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t have happened to a more appropriate group of candidates _meta_end_dot_
