  quick quiz when was this hillary clinton quote about iraq first uttered the fundamental point here is that the purpose of the surge was to create space for political reconciliation and that has not happened and there is no indication that it is going to happen or that the iraqis will meet the political benchmarks _meta_end_dot_

 we need to stop refereeing their civil war and start getting out of it this month when the bush administration started abandoning its own reconciliation goals _meta_end_question_

 last month when iraqi leaders conceded that reconciliation isn t going to happen _meta_end_question_

 or in september when the bush administration failed to meet its own iraqi benchmarks _meta_end_question_

 in this case the quote came from this month but the fact that it could have been said at any time in recent months suggests a certain consistency clinton s position hasn t changed at all _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the nyt s patrick healy perceives a shift in tone among democrats _meta_end_dot_

 and what evidence is there to support healy s notion of a tonal shift _meta_end_question_

 well as it turns out there isn t any healy spends over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ words and can t point to any rhetorical shifts at all _meta_end_dot_

 democratic candidates said before the recent decline in violence that they want to end the war _meta_end_dot_

 democrats candidates are now acknowledging the recent decline in violence but nevertheless concluding that they still want to end the war _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt wanted to find a change in political strategy in light of recent events but apparently couldn t find anything _meta_end_dot_

 the paper ran the story anyway pointing to an ambiguous tonal shift please _meta_end_dot_

 nailed it what amazes me is that political coverage of the candidates in the media has put consistency at the top of the list of key attributes _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to tim russert style questioning and bush cheney basing their entire _meta_number_ref_ campaign on alleged flip flops any policy shifts at all are now considered controversial _meta_end_dot_

 that s dumb enough but today s nyt piece has taken this approach to an unhealthy place healy s article points not to policy shift but to a tonal shift that may not exist _meta_end_dot_

 how very weak _meta_end_dot_
