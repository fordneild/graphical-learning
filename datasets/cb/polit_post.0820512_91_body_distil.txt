  it doesn t much matter what the root cause of john mccain s confusion is _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he s confused because he s old _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he s pretending to be confused to impress the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible he s confused because he just isn t the sharpest crayon in the box _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know and frankly don t much care _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the source the bottom line remains the same when it comes to iraq john mccain is hopelessly incoherent about the basics _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure geo political crises can be complicated but mccain isn t flubbing policy minutiae at an advanced seminar on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 as of yesterday he doesn t seem to even know what the surge is _meta_end_dot_

 remember according to mccain he s an expert on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the basis of his entire presidential campaign is his ability to handle matters like the war in iraq and the notion that his unparalleled expertise makes him uniquely qualified _meta_end_dot_

 except the man is shockingly confused and embarrasses himself more and more with each passing day _meta_end_dot_

 these comments to couric may be the single most striking mistake any presidential candidate has made in years _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ gerald ford said during a nationally televised debate there is no soviet domination of eastern europe it was a bizarre error that contributed greatly to his defeat _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain not understanding what the basics of the surge is at least as dramatic _meta_end_dot_

 as has become far too common lately mccain has the entire story backwards _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ gen _meta_end_dot_

 sean macfarland the commander of the _meta_number_ref_st brigade combat team _meta_number_ref_st armored division explained in september _meta_number_ref_ months before bush even decided to launch the surge that the awakening was already underway _meta_end_dot_

 spencer ackerman noting macfarland s remarks added for mccain to say that the anbar awakening is the product of the surge is either a lie or professional malpractice for a presidential candidate who is staking his election on his allegedly superior iraq judgment ilan goldenberg also explained indeed how do we know for sure that mccain is completely wrong _meta_end_question_

 because mccain himself used to acknowledge reality and got this right before _meta_end_dot_

 it s simply breathtaking _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to his signature issue mccain is little more than a fool _meta_end_dot_

 he s spouting obvious and demonstrable nonsense with the kind of confidence that only comes with abject stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is certainly entitled to his own opinions but he s not entitled to his own reality _meta_end_dot_

 we re well beyond gaffes here we ve reached the point at which it s reasonable to wonder if mccain genuinely understands what s going on around him _meta_end_dot_

 this is by any reasonable measure the kind of mistake that should ruin his chances of winning the white house _meta_end_dot_

 in the next post we ll talk about the bizarre decision by cbs news not to broadcast mccain s humiliating mistake _meta_end_dot_
