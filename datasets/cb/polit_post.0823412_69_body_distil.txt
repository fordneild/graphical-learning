  when it comes to relentlessly negative campaigning john mccain is setting a very high bar or a very low bar i suppose depending on one s perspective _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen attacks from the mccain gang in july that one might ordinarily expect from a _meta_number_ref_ group in october _meta_end_dot_

 the low road campaign has been ugly dishonest and shameful _meta_end_dot_

 and the public has noticed _meta_end_dot_

 that s quite a reputation mccain has earned for himself and in this case it s well deserved _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure mccain s dishonest negative attacks have had an effect inasmuch as they re weakened obama s support and increased his negative ratings _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time mccain s ugly style of campaigning may have helped convince quite a few americans that mccain fights dirty _meta_end_dot_

 on the flip side the obama campaign has been far more subtle in its approach _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that obama has refrained from mixing it up but rather that obama is taking a harder hitting message to local audiences not national ones _meta_end_dot_

 indeed some of the harshest advertising obama has approved has aired exclusively in local markets _meta_end_dot_

 this is part of a broader strategy _meta_end_dot_

 voters in ohio hear ads about mccain and the controversial dhl deal _meta_end_dot_

 voters in nevada see ads about mccain and yucca mountain _meta_end_dot_

 voters in the rust belt hear about mccain s support for bush s economic policies _meta_end_dot_

 is all politics local _meta_end_question_

 obama clearly hopes so _meta_end_dot_
