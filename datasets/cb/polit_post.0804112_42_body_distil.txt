  barack obama was expected to win yesterday s democratic contests but i think it s fair to say he exceeded expectations _meta_end_dot_

 it was more or less an afterthought but obama also appears to have won big in the virgin islands with nearly _meta_percent_ref_ support _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign responded to the setbacks with a line officials had been using preemptively in recent days the obama campaign has dramatically outspent our campaign in these three states saturating the airwaves with _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ second ads _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign has spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more in louisiana on television ads _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more in nebraska and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more in nebraska all of that is of course true _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure however if it s a compelling spin _meta_end_dot_

 in effect the clinton campaign is arguing we lost these states because we weren t trying very hard that may be accurate but it leads to questions about why the clinton campaign wasn t making a concerted effort to win these races _meta_end_dot_

 at this point every contest counts _meta_end_dot_

 asked a question i ve been pondering myself _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand historically primary victories are considered more impressive than caucus victories in large part because more people participate in primaries _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s caucus victories certainly seem impressive don t they _meta_end_question_

 after all the key to winning caucuses is on the ground organizational strength and an effective mobilizing strategy _meta_end_dot_

 obama s been excelling in caucuses in states like kansas and nebraska where there aren t a lot of minorities or fired up college students by very large margins _meta_end_dot_

 before voting began last month i was inclined to assume the opposite that the caucuses would favor clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in caucuses turnout is generally low and the process is guided by local party leaders and unions _meta_end_dot_

 it s exactly the kind of landscape that tends to favor the establishment candidate which i think it s fair to say has been clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and yet obama is winning these caucuses with relative ease while clinton is excelling with equal ease in many big primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it seems counterintuitive _meta_end_dot_

 please don t look at this as an opportunity to say clinton lost these caucuses because she s evil or obama won because he s amazing
