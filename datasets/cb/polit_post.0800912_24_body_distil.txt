  i ve seen some arguments that hillary clinton s victory in new hampshire isn t that surprising _meta_end_dot_

 polls showed her with enormous leads in the state throughout _meta_number_ref_ and as far back as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that she managed to beat barack obama by five three points will help get her campaign back on track but to characterize this as some kind of miraculous comeback is a bit of a stretch _meta_end_dot_

 she won where she was supposed to win _meta_end_dot_

 the argument is not without merit but i think this approach sells clinton short _meta_end_dot_

 no one thought she could win _meta_end_dot_

 none of the campaigns none of the pollsters none of the experts none of the locals no one _meta_end_dot_

 bill and hillary assumed she would lose as did the entire clinton campaign staff _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t one of those situations in which the campaign was saying nobody believes us but we re going to do really well on tuesday just the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 team clinton not only expected to lose they d already started making post defeat arrangements including a minor staff shake up that began yesterday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 and why not assume an obama victory _meta_end_question_

 his crowds in new hampshire were not only huge they were the biggest crowds anyone has ever seen in the state during a primary fight _meta_end_dot_

 his closing arguments were amazing _meta_end_dot_

 he had more volunteers and thanks to a post iowa bounce he led in literally every poll as of yesterday morning _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if pundits were guessing obama really was in position to deliver _meta_end_dot_

 but that obviously didn t occur _meta_end_dot_

 what happened _meta_end_question_

 how does a candidate trail by double digits on sunday and then win on tuesday _meta_end_question_

 given a complex campaign dynamic it wasn t just one factor or event that moved the race in clinton s favor but more likely a combination of elements _meta_end_dot_

 the bradley effect there s been a phenomenon for years in which african american candidates underperform against their poll numbers because of what some have labeled the bradley effect whereby white voters are embarrassed to admit to pollsters that they don t support a black candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this strikes me as an unlikely explanation for clinton s victory but there s ample speculation about this in political circles today _meta_end_dot_

 going negative works the clinton campaign didn t have much time after iowa but it immediately went negative on obama attacking him from a variety of directions on everything from taxes to abortion to the _meta_number_ref_ energy bill _meta_end_dot_

 i thought this made the clinton team look kind of desperate and the barrage of unfocused attacks would start to wash each other out but it s certainly possible the negative campaigning shifted some undecided voters _meta_end_dot_

 saturday night s debate it s inevitable to look for specific events that might have turned the tide in clinton s favor and the only major event between the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary was the debate on saturday night _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen some suggestions that clinton benefited from obama and edwards ganging up on her i think that s wrong obama didn t go negative at all he didn t have to but if that was the perception then it very well may have helped _meta_end_dot_

 media backlash isn t it possible that flinty new hampshire dems decided they didn t like the media picking the winner for them _meta_end_question_

 the pollsters stink all of them _meta_end_question_

 more than a half dozen pollsters surveying one small state at the same time and they re all incompetent _meta_end_question_

 while getting the republican primary exactly right _meta_end_question_

 the tears it seems at first glance utterly ridiculous to think hillary clinton getting choked up on monday might have propelled her to victory on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 and yet it was the biggest political moment of the last several days got wall to wall coverage in the media drew a wildly inappropriate response from john edwards and may very well have contributed to some sympathy for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind women backed obama in iowa but women backed hillary in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 before clinton supporters argue it s absurd to credit the tears for hillary s success note that campaign chairman terry mcauliffe credited the emotional moment for at least contributing to the victory let me add as an aside that some of this analysis may on its face seem silly _meta_end_dot_

 why did one candidate beat another candidate _meta_end_question_

 because voters liked the winner better _meta_end_dot_

 it s not rocket science _meta_end_dot_

 but given the circumstances there s much more to this _meta_end_dot_

 it s rare indeed it s arguably unprecedented to see this kind of surprise _meta_end_dot_

 given this it s not unreasonable for political observers to tilt their heads and ask huh
