  last week to the delight of republicans national journal released its latest rankings of u s _meta_end_dot_

 senators from most liberal to most conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the publication which strives to be scrupulously non partisan found that barack obama was the chamber s _meta_number_ref_ lib a development which caused a considerable stir in the media _meta_end_dot_

 for all the reasons we talked about the methodology for the rankings is a bit of a joke _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is national journal editor charles green has heard the criticisms and took the time to do a lengthy q _meta_number_ref_ a on the magazine s site to respond to concerns _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is green s pitch isn t exactly persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 most of green s responses were pretty boilerplate national journal was cautious it didn t know obama would come out on top the rankings aren t intended to influence the election yada yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 but green s take on a similar controversy in _meta_number_ref_ were especially illustrative _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 senators scores are based on three categories economic policy social policy and foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 kerry didn t have enough votes in two of the categories but national journal gave him a score anyway announced that he was the chamber s _meta_number_ref_ liberal and gave republicans a cudgel they used every day for months _meta_end_dot_

 four years later national journal is now willing to concede that the rating was a sham a flawed result based on a flawed methodology _meta_end_dot_

 four years later though we should take the obama rating seriously because well national journal says so _meta_end_dot_

 national journal argues that obama took the liberal approach on _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ key votes _meta_end_dot_

 there were other senators who cast more liberal votes on more liberal bills but that doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because national journal s arbitrary standards known only to the publication s editors say so _meta_end_dot_

 when considering votes the labels themselves are arbitrary _meta_end_dot_

 any rankings system that insists right off the bat that joe biden is more liberal than russ feingold and bernie sanders is automatically suspect but the closer one looks at the process the more flawed it appears _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that national journal is now willing to acknowledge that its john kerry ranking in _meta_number_ref_ was bogus is hardly reassuring if the magazine was wrong then perhaps it s not quite reliable now _meta_end_question_

 i still think brian beutler s observation is the right one t his is philistinism masquerading as social science it s the u s _meta_end_dot_

 news college guide of washington politics _meta_end_dot_

 journalists ought to understand that _meta_end_dot_

 and those of conscience ought to ignore it or lay it bare but certainly not feed into it
