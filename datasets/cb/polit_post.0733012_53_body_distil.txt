  today s installment of campaign related news items that wouldn t generate a post of their own but may be of interest to political observers slowly but surely rudy giuliani s scandalous personal life is becoming more of a campaign issue it just drives me nuts i have to be honest with you when politicians get up and talk about their personal life and then say oh everybody makes mistakes romney said _meta_end_dot_
