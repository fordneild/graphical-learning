  i ve read peggy noonan s latest wsj column a couple of times trying to make heads or tails of it _meta_end_dot_

 i m at a bit of a loss _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what noonan is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 she seems to wish that obama and mccain were running from the same place they grew up _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why or how this is supposed to be relevant to anyone _meta_end_dot_

 who cares _meta_end_question_

 noonan argues that this matters because if there is an end of placeness leaders may care less about pork barrel spending _meta_end_dot_

 beats me _meta_end_dot_

 can anyone explain why noonan wrote this and the wsj published it _meta_end_question_
