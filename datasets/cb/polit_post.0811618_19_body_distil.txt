  back in november when most of the republican presidential candidates were taking cheap shots at democratic candidates john mccain said he was above such behavior _meta_end_dot_

 i think people want a respectful debate and a respectful discussion _meta_end_dot_

 and if they don t then obviously i m not the person to be their candidate mccain said at the time _meta_end_dot_

 legitimate policy differences those should be debated and discussed _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t think you should take shots at people it was an odd thing to say given mccain s record of being a hothead who drops f bombs on his colleagues who dare to disagree with him but it was the kind of sentiment that sounded quite pleasant _meta_end_dot_

 after all who s against respectful discussion that focuses exclusively on legitimate policy differences _meta_end_question_

 the problem of course is how mccain defines respectful debate to borrow a line mccain keeps using the phrase but it doesn t mean what he thinks it means _meta_end_dot_

 a week ago today mccain s campaign sent out a fundraising letter telling supporters barack obama s foreign policy plans have even won him praise from hamas leaders _meta_end_dot_

 ahmed yousef chief political adviser to the hamas prime minister said we like mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama and we hope he will win the election _meta_end_dot_

 he has a vision to change america we need change in america but not the kind of change that wins kind words from hamas surrenders in iraq and will hold unconditional talks with iranian president ahmadinejad today mccain defended his scurrilous fundraising pitch _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good thing mccain doesn t believe in taking shots at people isn t it _meta_end_question_

 plainly false obama did publicly criticize the meeting _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign would not apologize for the false attack as for hamas alleged support for obama i can t vouch for the accuracy of a quote attributed to some hamas political advisor but it s worth noting as alex koppelman does that the same bush foreign policy vision that mccain loves has been fantastic for hamas _meta_end_dot_

 i don t recall mccain slamming bush for doing so much to advance hamas interests _meta_end_dot_

 and finally if these hamas focused attacks against obama are really what mccain has in mind when it comes to respectful debate and legitimate policy differences it s going to be a very long year _meta_end_dot_
