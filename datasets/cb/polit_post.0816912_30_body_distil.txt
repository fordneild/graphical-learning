  there are a plenty of interesting tidbits in the new wapo abc news poll overall barack obama leads john mccain by six among all americans _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and by four among registered voters _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but there was one set of numbers that was of particular interest _meta_end_dot_

 that s a very tough hurdle to clear _meta_end_dot_

 americans aren t satisfied with the status quo they believe the nation is going in the wrong direction _meta_percent_ref_ of poll respondents said the nation is seriously on the wrong track an all time high and john mccain has spent the last several years explaining to everyone who will listen that on the biggest issues he and bush are reading from the same script _meta_end_dot_

 sure mccain is scrambling now downplaying the notion that he s offering the nation a third bush term but a he s struggling to explain how he s different and b voters apparently aren t buying the new spin _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t supposed to happen _meta_end_dot_

 one of the reasons mccain was able to succeed in the republican primaries is because he still had some semblance of a maverick reputation which made him more electable than his gop rivals _meta_end_dot_

 he had to borrow the buzzword of the year the kind of brand that made media outlets and independent voters swoon _meta_end_dot_

 but given recent polls that show the public looking at mccain as more of the same it seems that americans aren t quite as fond of the new mccain or perhaps mccain s media image never really permeated outside the beltway in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 interesting item over the weekend about mccain s faltering reputation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain told nbc last week it s tough but i think the american people didn t get to know me yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 they know me they used to know him and then mccain decided to reinvent himself _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it s almost impossible to know what mccain s core convictions are or if he has any at all _meta_end_dot_

 i do know he had the kind of maverick independent centrist reputation that would have helped him run as an agent of change this year but would have made it tough to win the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain dropped the facade to become mr _meta_end_dot_

 four more years _meta_end_dot_

 voters don t seem to care for it and more importantly it s too late for him to do anything about it _meta_end_dot_
