  it never struck me as especially complicated _meta_end_dot_

 once there was a clear democratic presidential nominee the republican national committee would label him or her weak on terror liberal on everything and desperate to raise your taxes _meta_end_dot_

 throw in some references to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a few pictures of menacing looking middle easterners and a dash of immigrant bashing and voila _meta_end_exclamation_

 but it appears the rnc is hesitating not because they re unsure how to attack but rather because they want to avoid being labeled bigots _meta_end_dot_

 you can t run against barack obama the way you could run against bill clinton al gore or john kerry said former rep _meta_end_dot_

 jack kemp the _meta_number_ref_ gop vice presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 being an african american at the top of the ticket if he makes it is such a great statement about the country _meta_end_dot_

 obviously you have to be sensitive to issues that affect urban america _meta_end_dot_

 you have to be careful it s a really interesting report and i don t mean to dismiss it but i m having a difficult time believing this story _meta_end_dot_

 republican national committee which has never shown so much as a hint of concern about propriety in modern political times is not only worried about crossing lines of respect when it comes to diversity it s also leaking word to the politico about being only worried about crossing lines of respect when it comes to diversity _meta_end_question_

 the rnc _meta_end_question_

 it seems a little far fetched _meta_end_dot_

 look rnc officials know the difference between a clean attack and a dirty one _meta_end_dot_

 they recognize when an attack is driven by race based politics and when one is substantive and above board _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason they would need a focus group to help them out on this is if they planned to walk right up to the decency line and wanted to know how far they could go without crossing it _meta_end_dot_

 oh you mean because the republican party has gone out of its way to exploit racial divisions for partisan gain for generations _meta_end_question_

 and now it s causing a little anxiety because the margin for error will be lower _meta_end_question_
