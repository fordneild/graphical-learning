  most political observers know to stop reading when they see the phrase according to a poll from zogby interactive and yet yesterday i couldn t believe the commotion caused by a poll that obviously didn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ hours ago zogby interactive released a national poll showing john edwards and barack obama leading each of the top five republican presidential hopefuls in a hypothetical general election match up _meta_end_dot_

 the same poll however showed hillary clinton trailing the same five candidates even romney and huckabee who usually fare poorly due to low national name recognition _meta_end_dot_

 reuters ran this report as it turns out this was just the tip of the iceberg _meta_end_dot_

 blogs jumped on the poll results as did all of the cable news networks _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time gallup released a similar poll gauging the results of match ups of the top two dems against the top four republicans _meta_end_dot_

 these results were in line with reality dems up gop down _meta_end_dot_

 take a wild guess which of these two polls sparked a mini media frenzy _meta_end_dot_

 explains of course every political reporter editor and producer in the country knew that zogby interactive results were unreliable but they trumpeted the results anyway _meta_end_dot_

 there s probably more than one explanation of this but i suspect the zogby interactive data was what i think of as an iki poll i knew it poll _meta_end_dot_

 for a couple of years now when rumors that hillary clinton would run first emerged say around _meta_number_ref_ the conventional wisdom was that she would struggle in a general election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 sure she could win in the primaries but she would fare poorly against a republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and ever since all the data has shown otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 indeed all year long poll after poll showed clinton leading the gop field in hypothetical match ups _meta_end_dot_

 the predictions weren t playing out at least not yet _meta_end_dot_

 and then along comes the zogby interactive poll which wouldn t you know it offered numbers that were exactly in line with what the chattering class has expected for a year _meta_end_dot_

 a ha said reports _meta_end_dot_

 i knew it the media wanted a poll that confirmed pre existing suspicions _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the fact that the results didn t make any sense was apparently not much of a concern _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t responsible journalism require news outlets to a note why professional pollsters discount zogby interactive data and b also highlight the gallup numbers with equal enthusiasm _meta_end_question_

 update from hillary hub as of about _meta_number_ref_am the zogby poll was covered on tv news _meta_number_ref_ times and the gallup poll was mentioned twice by the hillary campaign s mark penn and ann lewis
