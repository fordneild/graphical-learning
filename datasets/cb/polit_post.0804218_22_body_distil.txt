  following up on an earlier item the president s appearance on fox news sunday covered a fair amount of ground but this exchange helped highlight so many of bush s flaws _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but wonder if the president appreciates how foolish this is _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand bush is conceding that he s content to allow the very wealthy to hire good accountants shirk their legal responsibilities and pass along the tax burden to the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 if the president is convinced that the rich are able to figure out how not to pay their tax bill shouldn t he you know care about fixing a system in which by his own explanation middle class families are getting screwed _meta_end_question_

 on the other hand if the very wealthy are in fact successfully avoiding taxes why is it the bush administration has gone to great lengths to cut their taxes even more _meta_end_question_

 in other words as far as the president is concerned to spur economic growth we should cut taxes for the rich allow them to spend more and wait for prosperity to trickle down to everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 except to hear bush explain it on fox news these people have already figured out how to beat the system _meta_end_dot_

 why then give tax cuts to rich people who aren t paying their taxes to begin with _meta_end_question_

 indeed why make that the centerpiece of the administration s entire economic policy for more than seven years _meta_end_question_

 october _meta_number_ref_ john kerry says oh i m just going to tax the rich well the rich hire lawyers and accountants for a reason that s to stick you with the tab august _meta_number_ref_ y ou know how the tax code works _meta_end_dot_

 when they say tax the rich those are the folks who have got the accountants to see to it they don t pay tax so guess who gets stuck with the bill _meta_end_question_

 you re going to get stuck with the bill _meta_end_dot_

 the worst thing for job creation is to be running up the taxes on the working people of this country _meta_end_dot_

 and we re not going to let john kerry have a chance to do so as for the fox news interview chris wallace not surprisingly didn t follow up on the president s remarks but i have a question for bush and maybe some enterprising reporter could bring it up at the next white house press briefing if the president is convinced that the rich are violating tax law and that the middle class is getting stuck with the bill why hasn t he proposed doing anything about it _meta_end_question_
