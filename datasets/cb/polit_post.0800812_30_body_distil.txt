  once the interest in hillary clinton s tears had run its course the political world quickly shifted its attention late yesterday to some odd remarks about clinton obama lbj and martin luther king _meta_end_dot_

 first a little context _meta_end_dot_

 at saturday night s debate clinton warned of the dangers associated with false hope yesterday obama told a new hampshire audience that he rejects that kind of thinking and alluded to the _meta_number_ref_s as an example dr _meta_end_dot_

 king standing on the steps of the lincoln memorial looking out over the magnificent crowd the reflecting pool the washington monument sorry guys false hopes the dream will die it can t be done false hope we don t need leaders who tell us what we can t do we need leaders to tell us what we can do and inspire us asked to respond to obama s comments clinton told fox news there s a video of the fox news segment online _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose there are a couple of ways to look at clinton s comments some less flattering than others _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall thinks clinton was comparing herself to lbj while making obama jfk _meta_end_dot_

 and taking the other side among others is oliver willis _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s a matter open to some interpretation but my inclination is to side with oliver on this _meta_end_dot_

 the key part of the quote is this it took a president to get it done it fits into clinton s broader argument about talk vs _meta_end_dot_

 action and in this context it seemed clinton was referring to king as someone who talked while johnson was the one who got it done the more charitable interpretation suggests that clinton was comparing obama to john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy though as campaign comparisons go that may not be where clinton wants to go either _meta_end_dot_

 some of the errors that have taken clinton off her game the last few weeks seem easily avoided _meta_end_dot_

 i think we can safely add this one to the list _meta_end_dot_
