  as it turns out i won t be at my desk when the results of the iowa caucuses are released so here s an open thread to a make predictions b highlight results c brag about your candidate s success and or d complain about your candidate coming up short _meta_end_dot_

 as for what to expect while you re expecting the caucuses are set to begin right about now in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ precincts across the lovely hawkeye state _meta_end_dot_

 results should start coming in about an hour from now with republican results coming first the gop caucuses work slightly differently than the dems _meta_end_dot_

 for the mechanics of the process i d encourage folks to check out zeitgeist s post from this morning which was very helpful _meta_end_dot_

 as for checking results as they re available there are literally dozens of sites that will be posting the numbers though i know the politico will be keeping an updated tally _meta_end_dot_

 also check the iowa democratic party and the iowa gop both of which will be publishing results _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the idp s site will probably be the single most detailed resource available publishing precinct county and state information updated from what i hear every minute and with that have at it _meta_end_dot_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_
