  one of the many striking angles to the white house s fiasco in iraq is that the two men in charge bush and cheney seemed to have a fairly reasonable grasp on iraq policy before they took office _meta_end_dot_

 the president didn t have any foreign policy experience before taking office of course but as reader r k _meta_end_dot_

 noted via email not long before becoming president he had clear opinions about the right course of action when it came to saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 predictably the white house responded by noting that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ changed everything so bush getting iraq right before taking office has no bearing on bush getting iraq wrong once in office _meta_end_dot_

 it s not much of an argument governor bush didn t like quagmires but president bush does _meta_end_question_

 really got the policy right in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ cheney emphasized the intense sectarian rivalries that dominate iraqi society and the likely inability to maintain stability in baghdad after a war _meta_end_dot_

 as for replacing saddam with a democracy cheney asked his audience how much credibility is that government going to have if it s set up by the united states military when it s there he added then in _meta_number_ref_ cheney reiterated his position _meta_end_dot_

 as thinkprogress noted a while back cheney was repeating the line as recently as _meta_number_ref_ those guys sure were smart weren t they _meta_end_question_
