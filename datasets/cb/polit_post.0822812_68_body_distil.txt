  it was obviously a slip of the tongue but it was a gaffe that underscored an important point john mccain seems to think he s already the president _meta_end_dot_

 another president _meta_end_question_

 as in president mccain harkening back to one of his presidential predecessors _meta_end_question_

 now truth be told i don t much care about a verbal slip up like this _meta_end_dot_

 the point however is that after weeks of palaver about barack obama being presumptuous john mccain has taken this week to play pretend president in large part because he felt like the conflict in georgia gave him a good excuse to do so _meta_end_dot_

 in this case it goes well beyond referring to himself as the president and includes near constant direct discussions with a foreign head of state during a military conflict and dispatching campaign surrogates to a war zone _meta_end_dot_

 we talk about how there s only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable said lawrence korb a reagan defense department official who now acts as an informal adviser to the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments _meta_end_dot_

 they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didn t do anything close to this but does it underscore policy expertise _meta_end_question_

 there s a difference between being engaged and being knowledgeable mccain is working the phones and pretending to be a head of state but what is it exactly that he s contributing to the diplomatic process _meta_end_question_

 he can exclaim we re all georgians now but is the depth of his understanding of the geo political dynamics _meta_end_question_

 mccain can probably find georgia on a map but what has he done this week that suggests he knows what he s talking about _meta_end_question_

 josh marshall made the case the other day that this argument is largely backwards _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is proving himself a leader he s proving himself a presumptuous nut who longs for the days of cold war simplicity _meta_end_dot_
