  ok new rule _meta_end_dot_

 high profile democrats and surrogates for the democratic presidential candidates can no longer go on fox news and praise the republican network for its balanced coverage of the horserace _meta_end_dot_

 pennsylvania gov _meta_end_dot_

 ed rendell d i m looking at you _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch clips online the video shows rendell a major clinton backer appearing on fox and friends speaking to steve doocy saying i think during this entire primary coverage starting in iowa and up to the present fox has done the fairest job and remained the most objective of all the cable networks _meta_end_dot_

 you hate both of our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 no i m only kidding _meta_end_dot_

 but you actually have done a very balanced job of reporting the news and some of the other stations are just caught up with senator obama who is a great guy but senator obama can do no wrong and senator clinton can do no right oh my _meta_end_dot_

 rendell s argument seemed to be that fox news is more negative towards obama than the credible cable news networks which therefore makes fox news fair objective and balanced fortunately i know hillary clinton doesn t believe this so it s not fair to connect her to these remarks directly _meta_end_dot_

 rendell may have been on the network this morning to represent the campaign but clinton made it clear when she pulled out of a fox news sponsored debate last year that she considers the network a partisan outfit _meta_end_dot_

 still for any real democrat especially a former chairman of the dnc to go on fox news and praise the network s coverage is both foolish and frustrating _meta_end_dot_

 just how wrong rendell is _meta_end_dot_

 maybe someone could direct rendell to fox attacks _meta_end_dot_

 if he spent a few minutes there i doubt he d repeat such nonsense _meta_end_dot_
