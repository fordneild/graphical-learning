  obviously we ve never seen a political dynamic in this country in which a president s spouse also ran for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note we ve also haven t seen a former president take an active and assertive role in his party s nominating process directly attacking one of his party s leading candidates during the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it s led to a very awkward political environment in democratic circles _meta_end_dot_

 there was some talk among the chattering class last year about whether bill clinton would be a hindrance for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i always found the speculation rather silly bc left office as the most popular president in decades his stature has only grown since and he commands widespread admiration in democratic circles _meta_end_dot_

 if anything hrc was the immediate frontrunner precisely because of goodwill towards her husband _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to admit i ve been surprised not only by the former president s unusually aggressive posture towards barack obama over the last month or so but by the party s discomfort with bill clinton s conduct _meta_end_dot_

 michael tomasky noted the other day tomasky s hardly the only one _meta_end_dot_

 newsweek s jonathan alter reported that prominent democrats including sen _meta_end_dot_

 edward kennedy and rep _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel believe bill clinton s conduct has been inappropriate and have told their old friend heatedly on the phone that he needs to change his tone and stop attacking obama _meta_end_dot_

 over the weekend josh marshall an admitted fan of the former president described his own discomfort in seeing the man who is in many respects still the de facto leader of the democratic party certainly its elder statesman inject himself as an attack dog into a intra party contest _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s damaging to him and more importantly i think it s damaging to his party given all of this obama now apparently feels comfortable enough to start pushing back gingerly against the former president _meta_end_dot_

 described his willingness to confront bill clinton which he said is necessary given the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch videos online the clip shows obama saying you know the former president who i think all of us have a lot of regard for has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that i think is pretty troubling _meta_end_dot_

 he continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts whether it s about my record of opposition to the war in iraq or our approach to organizing in las vegas _meta_end_dot_

 this has become a habit and one of the things that we re gonna have to do is to directly confront bill clinton when he s making statements that are not factually accurate like the rest of the race it ll be interesting to see where this goes _meta_end_dot_

 there s simply no way the clinton campaign will scale back the former president s campaign efforts and it s also unlikely the former president will hold back in his criticisms of his wife s principal democratic rival _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign meanwhile is in the untenable position of effectively running against two political powerhouses bill and hillary clinton at the same time even though only one is actually a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 will bc be able to dial it down a notch _meta_end_question_

 will obama help or hurt himself if he forcefully challenges the former president _meta_end_question_

 will dems be turned off by the clinton campaign s good cop bad cop routine _meta_end_question_

 will hrc benefit or suffer from the two against one dynamic _meta_end_question_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
