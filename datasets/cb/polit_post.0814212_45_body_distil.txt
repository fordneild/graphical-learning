  it s funny in a way _meta_end_dot_

 every time joe lieberman gets more comfortable in the role of republican attack dog i think well now he s done it _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman couldn t possibly get any worse and yet the guy keeps finding new sharks to jump over _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that lieberman has changed necessarily but rather it s that his hackery has become more intense and bellicose _meta_end_dot_

 he s gone from being a largely incoherent neocon to being a largely incoherent belligerent neocon _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman touches all the far right bases in a spectacularly inane op ed for the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if lieberman is living in some kind of twilight zone _meta_end_dot_

 after the attacks of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ democrats were on board with a unified global counter terrorism strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the problem came when the bush gang cheered on by mccain lieberman and bill kristol decided that the strategy needed to change and it was time to go after iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the result is the democratic party further to the american mainstream on foreign policy and national security than at any point since the end of the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 makes the argument about the zell ification of lieberman noting that lieberman is not yet a raving lunatic like miller but rather that lieberman s transformation from a democrat with weak partisan attachments to essentially a partisan republican is complete _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s right but i m not sure if it goes far enough _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways lieberman is actually worse than miller _meta_end_dot_

 the latter s tragic deterioration led him to simply be exploited _meta_end_dot_

 when miller fell apart it was sad and painful to watch _meta_end_dot_

 the proper response wasn t anger but pity over what had become of a once great democratic voice _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman however has no excuse _meta_end_dot_

 he was the democratic vp candidate eight years ago sought the party s presidential nomination four years ago and vowed to his own constituents as recently as two years ago that he was almost desperate to help elect a democratic president in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he s repulsed by the foreign policy worldviews of obama and the clintons now but it was lieberman who begged them to campaign for him two years ago when their worldviews were identical to what they are now _meta_end_dot_

 if it was unclear before the necessity of the democratic party distancing itself from lieberman s bizarre and extreme worldview seems to be more obvious with each passing day _meta_end_dot_
