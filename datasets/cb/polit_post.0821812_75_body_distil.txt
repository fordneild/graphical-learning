  ron suskind a pulitzer prize winning author journalist has been a thorn in the side of the bush white house for a few years now but this might be the most damning revelation yet suskind reports in his new book that white house officials ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein the goal of the letter apparently was to portray a false link between hussein s regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war deputy white house press secretary tony fratto denied the report calling the version of events suskind described as absurd that said suskind is a considerably more reliable source than the bush white house _meta_end_dot_

 nearly as scandalous suskind s new book to be published next week also reports that the administration had information from a top iraqi intelligence official who told u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials that saddam did not have weapons of mass destruction _meta_end_dot_

 what s more kevin had a good item noting the recent related revelations including a report that the fbi was pressured to lie about the origins of the _meta_number_ref_ anthrax attacks a report that bush once suggested flying fake un planes over iraq in the hopes of instigating a war and a report that dick cheney considered an idea to dress up navy seals as iranians put them on fake iranian speedboats and shoot at them _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s coincidence kevin said _meta_end_dot_

 maybe all these sources are just making stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but that s a helluva similar pattern of allegations isn t it
