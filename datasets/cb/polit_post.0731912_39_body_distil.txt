  in recent months there have been some encouraging trends in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 violence has been less rampant and attacks have been less catastrophic _meta_end_dot_

 the trend may be temporary and the possible result of a successful ethnic cleansing campaign but for right now the daily bloodshed is not as devastating as it was up until quite recently _meta_end_dot_

 the white house and its allies predictably insist this means the surge policy is a success _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s foolish the administration s policy was implemented to foster political reconciliation in iraq of which there s been none _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the political progress has gone backwards and successes at the local level the so called bottom up approach necessarily undermines the goal of a unified democratic iraq that will serve as a beacon for the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 it s reached the point in which u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials are beginning to suspect that surprise surprise the goals of the surge may not be attainable after all _meta_end_dot_

 apparently sunnis and shi a in iraq oddly enough still don t like or trust each other _meta_end_dot_

 even the practical defeat of aqi carries a downside _meta_end_dot_

 maj _meta_end_dot_

 mark brady who works on reconciliation issues noted that a sunni leader told him as soon as we finish with al qaeda we start with the shiite extremists ugh _meta_end_dot_

 arming both sides of a civil war with no ideas or mechanism in place to achieve reconciliation apparently isn t a recipe for success _meta_end_dot_

 who could have imagined it _meta_end_dot_

 making the case for the obvious resolution and lamenting the strategic drift that maintains the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 sounds right to me _meta_end_dot_
