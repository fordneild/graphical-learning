  the cbs evening news has come up with an interesting little feature _meta_end_dot_

 katie couric s show as part of its primary questions character leadership _meta_number_ref_ the candidates series comes up with a simple straightforward question and then asks the _meta_number_ref_ leading presidential candidates from both parties to offer a short straightforward answer _meta_end_dot_

 last week for example the candidates were asked to talk a little bit about their biggest mistake this week the question was slightly more substantive though worded poorly do you think the risks of climate change are at all overblown _meta_end_question_

 the dems answered the question fairly well _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards hillary clinton and barack obama all said the risk isn t over hyped joe biden for whatever reason didn t answer the question directly but seemed like he was on the right track and bill richardson had perhaps the best answer no if anything they re underblown so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 even a few of the republicans weren t completely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney called the risks associated with climate change real john mccain said i ve been to the arctic and i know it s real rudy giuliani added there is global warming _meta_end_dot_

 human beings are contributing to it and then there were the other two _meta_end_dot_

 oh my _meta_end_dot_

 there s reality _meta_end_dot_

 second there s huckabee s notion that the united states can be be free of energy consumption in this country within a decade i m pretty sure that s physically impossible _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum tries to figure out what on earth the statement even means _meta_end_dot_

 third couric pressed mccain on why energy company lobbyists have been successful in blocking any serious policy proposals _meta_end_dot_

 he neglected to mention that the republican party is bought and paid for _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth what kind of question is do you think the risks of climate change are at all overblown by its very wording the implication is that the risks may very well be overblown which kind of poisons the well a bit _meta_end_dot_

 if i were to ask do you think rudy giuliani might be a raving lunatic the question suggests the answer _meta_end_dot_

 my defense would be i didn t say giuliani is a raving lunatic i just asked about the possibility i doubt giuliani would find the defense persuasive though _meta_end_dot_
