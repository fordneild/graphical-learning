  guest post by morbo louisiana gov _meta_end_dot_

 bobby jindal has signed legislation allowing public school teachers to use supplemental materials in class when teaching about evolution _meta_end_dot_

 this is necessary the new laws says to promote academic freedom after all everyone knows evolution is controversial what will these supplemental materials be like _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say because the law does not describe them _meta_end_dot_

 it does state however that these materials are not supposed to promote religion _meta_end_dot_

 this was thrown in as a sop to pinkos rabble rousers and other malcontents who actually believe the constitution should be obeyed even in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana of course has a long history of being on the cutting edge of science _meta_end_dot_

 weary of plain old evolution science bold louisiana lawmakers in _meta_number_ref_ decided to supplement it with creation science a law required both to be taught side by side so that the kids could decide which was true _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately extremists on the supreme court who hate academic freedom struck down the law _meta_end_dot_

 louisianans quickly regrouped _meta_end_dot_

 some parishes began pasting stickers in science books warning that evolution was discussed within _meta_end_dot_

 but courts looked with disfavor on this as well _meta_end_dot_

 so now we go to round three and the new supplemental materials law _meta_end_dot_

 but many still wonder what exactly are these sources _meta_end_question_

 wonder no more _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 dvds of flintstones reruns _meta_end_dot_

 kids can learn a lot from these _meta_end_dot_

 for example they show how humans and dinosaurs not only lived together back in the day but also demonstrate early man s ability to harness the power of dinosaurs to improve his own life _meta_end_dot_

 fred flinstone s job at the rock quarry is a good example _meta_end_dot_

 dinosaurs there helped him lift and smash rocks for the betterment of all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 land of the lost episodes _meta_end_dot_

 not everyone is comfortable using flintstones reruns in class _meta_end_dot_

 let s face it the closing theme songs does promise that when you re with the flintstones you ll have a gay old time and fred and barney did seem awfully close in some episodes _meta_end_dot_

 for these folks land of the lost is the perfect in class supplement _meta_end_dot_

 this series teaches important science lessons _meta_end_dot_

 for example did you know that you can use a giant log to swat dinosaurs and that there are many ways to outwit bizarre bipedal lizard men _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the special book _meta_end_dot_

 the special book which is not the bible is full of interesting old stories about the way people used to live a long time ago and this great friend they had in the sky who would help them _meta_end_dot_

 although it s most definitely not the bible you can learn a lot by reading the special book because it teaches a lot about science _meta_end_dot_

 the special book teaches us so much about every topic _meta_end_dot_

 but don t think it s the bible _meta_end_exclamation_

 because it most certainly is not _meta_end_dot_

 no it s not the bible _meta_end_dot_

 no siree _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 evolution schmevolution by the staff of the discovery institute _meta_end_dot_

 this fascinating new tome by the wacky gang of ph d _meta_end_dot_

 actual scientists who do real science at the scientifically oriented discovery institute the nation s leading think tank promoting good science scientific literacy academic freedom and science sciency science real cool science he man science science and super science explains how _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the world s biologists paleontologists anthropologists and geologists are wrong and how people were really designed by a special force as fully explained in the special book the book that is not the bible by the way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana special science bulletin _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a evolution not as solid as you think distributed by the louisiana department of education and produced by focus on the family in conjunction with the louisiana pastors council the southern baptist convention and the federation of independent fundamentalist non instrumental churches of jesus christ in god the holy redeemer of the blessed holy ghost non pentecostal with input from the pentecostal assembly of the holy spirit thrice blessed redeeming blood of the most precious jesus _meta_end_dot_

 comes with a special supplement for use in sex education classes that has also been endorsed by focus on the family and louisiana citizens for decency supplemental storks new findings cast doubt on sperm and egg theory both bulletins are totally scientific having been casually proofread by a guy who before he entered the ministry considered majoring in biology at bob jones university _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s a short list but it s likely a lot more valuable material will be added once the law really gets into effect _meta_end_dot_

 it makes me jealous _meta_end_dot_

 i wish my children were learning cutting edge supplemental science instead of boring old regular science _meta_end_dot_
