  yesterday while exploring whether a center left presidential candidate can win with a progressive policy agenda the nyt noted and that came shortly after james dobson issued an alert to his religious right membership and that came shortly after mark penn hillary clinton s pollster and strategist repeated the right s talking point _meta_end_dot_

 i d hoped previous efforts to highlight how foolish this might have had an effect but it appears some highly misleading talking points are harder to knock down than others _meta_end_dot_

 media matters take was especially helpful _meta_end_dot_

 this really isn t complicated _meta_end_dot_

 national journal argues that some senators weren t given scores if they missed too many votes _meta_end_dot_

 obama missed a full third of the _meta_number_ref_ votes used for the ratings but that wasn t enough to disqualify him from the rankings _meta_end_dot_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 because national journal s arbitrary standards known only to the publication s editors say so _meta_end_dot_

 national journal argues that obama took the liberal approach on _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ key votes _meta_end_dot_

 there were other senators who cast more liberal votes on more liberal bills and senators who voted the party line more often than obama but that doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because national journal s arbitrary standards known only to the publication s editors say so _meta_end_dot_

 when considering votes the labels themselves are arbitrary _meta_end_dot_

 any rankings system that insists right off the bat that joe biden is more liberal than russ feingold and bernie sanders is automatically suspect but the closer one looks at the process the more flawed it appears _meta_end_dot_

 that national journal is willing to acknowledge that its john kerry ranking in _meta_number_ref_ was bogus is hardly reassuring if the magazine was wrong then perhaps it s not quite reliable now _meta_end_question_

 i still think brian beutler s observation is the right one t his is philistinism masquerading as social science it s the u s _meta_end_dot_

 news college guide of washington politics _meta_end_dot_

 journalists ought to understand that _meta_end_dot_

 and those of conscience ought to ignore it or lay it bare but certainly not feed into it that was true when brian said it in january and the rankings look no better now _meta_end_dot_
