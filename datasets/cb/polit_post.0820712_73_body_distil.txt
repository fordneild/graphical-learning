  guest post by ron chusid steve m _meta_end_dot_

 has beaten me to commenting on one item i was thinking about writing on so i will keep this brief _meta_end_dot_

 as he mentioned john mccain was critical of barack obama s statement in his speech in germany where he referred to himself as a citizen of the world _meta_end_dot_

 as steve m _meta_end_dot_

 also pointed out george bush has used the phrase citizen of the world in a favorable context and he is not alone in doing so _meta_end_dot_

 even ronald reagan has done so _meta_end_dot_

 while steve has handled this issue well there are two points i d like to add _meta_end_dot_

 the implication in many of the attacks on obama from the right over this is that being a citizen of the world means he is somehow not a loyal american _meta_end_dot_

 they tend to ignore the fact that obama said i come to berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before _meta_end_dot_

 tonight i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world i bet not many right wingers will repeat obama s statement of being a proud citizen of the united states that won t fit in well with the meme that he is really a muslim terrorist and a manchurian candidate _meta_end_dot_

 while many liberal bloggers have defended obama i most enjoyed a defense of obama on this point from a libertarian blogger _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately he weakened his post by making a derogatory comment on john kerry s reference to a global test which was twisted to mean something quite different from what was intended david weigle of reason wrote perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 my fear is that mccain s map of the world is made up of lots of places marked places to bomb that includes a huge arrow pointed at iran _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted from liberal values
