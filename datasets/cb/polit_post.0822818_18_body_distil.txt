  way back in april which seems like a surprisingly long time ago atrios had a prediction this election is going to be much much stupider than the last time _meta_end_dot_

 last time much of the stupid was at least nominally about serious issues this time it s just all about the stupid the last four months have made this prediction look pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of this wapo column from e _meta_end_dot_

 j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne jr published during the democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i not only think this was and is right i think it points to a deliberate strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger the election the more likely an obama victory because on the biggest issues the strength of our economy the intelligence of our foreign policy the sanity of our environmental policies the sensibility of our judiciary the condition of our healthcare system obama is clearly obviously transparently right and mccain is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 as dionne noted the smaller this election looks the easier it will be for the republicans to run campaigns such as those they orchestrated in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ in which the particular flaws of candidates take on an exaggerated importance the drive dionne added is to run this election through an incredible shrinking machine that was in april _meta_end_dot_

 it looks even more accurate now _meta_end_dot_

 kevin noted today quite right _meta_end_dot_

 hell by the standards of this presidential campaign the russo georgian war has actually been a reasonably significant drop in a sea of nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 this may sound like cheerleading but all available evidence suggests obama really wants to have good faith discussions about the major challenges facing our future _meta_end_dot_

 accordingly he s offered pretty detailed prescriptions in every major policy area _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t go so far as to say obama s pitch has been pander free but by modern standards he s been setting the curve on substantive high minded campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 and have we heard from mccain _meta_end_question_

 when he s not describing his own beliefs in vague generalities he and his campaign are talking up celebrities britney spears paris hilton tire gauges and arugula _meta_end_dot_

 today the mccain campaign i m not making this up even went after obama for taking his shirt off on a beach _meta_end_dot_

 trivial nonsense stacked on top of trivial nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 i had naively expected a lot more especially given the magnitude of what s at stake _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we are _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger the challenges the dumber the republican rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 the more important the election the smaller the republican campaign _meta_end_dot_
