  after months of speculation and unsolicited advice mitt romney suggested a few weeks ago that he was inclined to give a major campaign speech outlining his religious beliefs and how his mormon faith might affect his administration but his campaign aides were against it saying it would draw too much attention to romney s religious tradition _meta_end_dot_

 asked if he d ever deliver a special speech on the subject romney added perhaps at some point now that romney is falling behind it looks like that point has arrived _meta_end_dot_

 john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy spoke to the greater houston ministerial association on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and made a powerful case that his administration would be neutral on matters of faith hoping to assuage fears that his roman catholicism would be a problem in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 this week romney will also travel to texas for a similar reason _meta_end_dot_

 a senior romney campaign official said the address is not going to be a lesson in mormon doctrine but rather an open discussion of how important and critical faith has been and is in romney s life and how faith is what shapes our values this idea is almost certainly going to fail _meta_end_dot_

 but as for changing the political landscape and alleviating the concerns of voters who are hesitant to support a mormon candidate it s hard to imagine how romney s speech is going to do any good at all _meta_end_dot_

 there are two broad considerations here the theological and the political _meta_end_dot_

 theologically speaking there s nothing romney can do to convince evangelicals that mormons are mainstream christians _meta_end_dot_

 giving a high profile speech like this as noam scheiber noted may very well exacerbate the problem _meta_end_dot_

 indeed for those evangelical republican voters who are moving to mike huckabee because of his religious right style worldview romney praising religious liberty will be utterly meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 they know romney s religious they know his faith has shaped his life and they re probably well aware of the fact that romney won t use his office to push mormonism on the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 but they don t care they just don t like mormons _meta_end_dot_

 and given romney s own bigotry towards muslims it s not like he has any real moral authority on the subject anyway which leads us to romney s political problem _meta_end_dot_

 he s apparently delivering this speech from a position of near panic with his once huge lead in iowa having disappeared altogether _meta_end_dot_

 in response to these conditions romney wants to share his views on the grand tradition religious tolerance has played in the progress of our nation i m not sure if romney s been paying attention to republican politics lately but right wing iowa caucus voters who are already pre disposed not to like mormons don t much care for religious tolerance indeed many of them revel in their intolerance _meta_end_dot_

 it s what makes the whole jfk analogy so silly to me _meta_end_dot_

 romney is facing an entirely different kind of challenge _meta_end_dot_

 he can t deliver a similar kennedy like speech precisely because the same message is now republican anathema _meta_end_dot_

 nearly a half century after jfk s speech in houston many of today s conservatives particularly those in the gop s religious right base abhor the very idea of church state separation which was the basis for kennedy s address _meta_end_dot_

 it s not unusual to hear figures like james dobson and pat robertson reject the constitutional principle s very existence _meta_end_dot_

 if romney were to publicly argue that the separation of church and state is absolute as jfk did he would be booed aggressively by conservative audiences that want more intermingling between religion and government not less _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the nature of the controversy is very different now than in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 conservative republicans uneasy about romney s faith aren t worried that salt lake city will dictate policy through the white house they re just not comfortable with a faith tradition with which they re unfamiliar and in some cases find heretical _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense as a friend of mine recently argued romney is boxed in time will tell but i m skeptical this week s speech will make any difference at all and it might make things worse _meta_end_dot_
