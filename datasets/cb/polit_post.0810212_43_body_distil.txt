  democratic national committee chairman howard dean hosted a press briefing yesterday to go over some new polling data from _meta_number_ref_ swing states and mentioned that the party would probably not go after john mccain s age as a campaign issue _meta_end_dot_

 noting that it s the kind of personal tactic republicans would be far more comfortable with dean said i doubt we will bring it up in the election _meta_end_dot_

 he added there is somewhat of a higher ethical bar on what we do _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have any lee atwaters or karl roves on our side that said the opportunity is certainly there _meta_end_dot_

 a republican national committee spokesperson insisted that age is not a concern because voters associate mccain with judgment character vision and leadership that s debatable of course but there s ample evidence that if they also associate mccain with _meta_number_ref_ candles on a birthday cake it may be a real problem for the republican campaign _meta_end_dot_

 an item from a couple of weeks ago no one seems to want to go there when it comes to mccain s age but voters seem concerned _meta_end_dot_

 the latest nbc wsj poll pdf asked respondents if they think americans are prepared to elect an otherwise qualified candidate who happens to be have certain characteristics _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of americans for example said the country is prepared to elect an african american president and _meta_percent_ref_ said we re also ready for a woman president _meta_end_dot_

 but when asked about a candidate over the age of _meta_number_ref_ the number dropped to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 also last month a wapo abc poll found that more than one in four voters _meta_percent_ref_ said mccain s age would make them less enthusiastic to support him _meta_end_dot_

 a cbs nyt poll from february asked americans what the best age is for a president _meta_end_dot_

 a majority _meta_percent_ref_ preferred someone in their _meta_number_ref_s while a president in his or her _meta_number_ref_s was second with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how many preferred someone in their _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 less than one percent _meta_end_dot_

 way back in february _meta_number_ref_ a wapo abc poll asked americans i m going to read a few attributes that might be found in a candidate for president _meta_end_dot_

 please tell me if each would make you more likely to vote for that candidate for president or less likely to vote for that candidate or if it wouldn t matter no specific candidate names were mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 when it came to attributes like race gender religion and marital status poll respondents generally didn t care at all _meta_end_dot_

 when the poll mentioned a _meta_number_ref_ year old candidate _meta_percent_ref_ said they would be less likely to vote for such a candidate more than the totals for a woman african american and or mormon combined _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time a usat gallup showed that _meta_percent_ref_ of voters said they wouldn t support an otherwise qualified _meta_number_ref_ year old candidate _meta_end_dot_

 dean went out of his way yesterday to suggest dems aren t going to exploit the age issue and i suspect he s right _meta_end_dot_

 unless the general election race got very ugly i d be surprised if the dnc and or the democratic nominee emphasized mccain s personal weakness _meta_end_dot_

 that said the media may not be talking about the issue but voters care and it may be this year s sleeper issue _meta_end_dot_
