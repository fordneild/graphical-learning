  honestly it s like deja vu all over again _meta_end_dot_

 when the presidential campaign starts to resemble groundhog day i keep thinking about an item time s joe klein wrote about a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 klein a mccain admirer predicted that mccain would avoid the cheap and pathetic style of campaigning we re seeing now _meta_end_dot_

 mccain klein said sees the tawdry ceremonies of politics the spin and hucksterism as unworthy if he doesn t mccain will have to live with the knowledge that in the most important business of his life he chose expediency over honor _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably not the way he wants to be remembered klein was mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has seen the tawdry ceremonies of politics the spin and hucksterism and has come to believe that americans are just dumb enough to fall for the con _meta_end_dot_

 mccain almost certainly knows that this gas tax idea is ridiculous and he has to realize that railing against the elites for acknowledging reality is a special kind of stupid _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain peddles nonsense anyway hoping voters won t know the difference _meta_end_dot_

 that his proposal wouldn t do anything to help low income americans wouldn t lower the price of gas and would boost oil company profits seems entirely irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 a confidence man in the middle of a scam can t be bothered with reality it only gets in the way of the deception _meta_end_dot_

 wrote according to the one economist willing to defend the idea a gas tax holiday won t save consumers any money and will boost oil company profits _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter let s also not forget that mccain s approach to this policy is even worse than clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 she at least wanted to replace the lost revenue with a tax increase _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wants to cut the tax boost oil company profits leave the price of gas unchanged and either leave the national highway trust fund with _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in lost revenue costing thousands of jobs and undermining u s _meta_end_dot_

 infrastructure projects or replace the money by boosting the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to public policy john mccain is just not a serious person _meta_end_dot_

 he like the man he hopes to replace doesn t care for details or substance or explanations _meta_end_dot_

 mccain even appears to lack the curiosity to care _meta_end_dot_
