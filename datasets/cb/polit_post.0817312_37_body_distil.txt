  guest post by morbo a new book about barack obama s faith is raising eyebrows mainly because of its author _meta_end_dot_

 stephen mansfield s the faith of barack obama is due out in august _meta_end_dot_

 the politico received an advance copy and reports that it s a very positive portrayal of obama and his religion _meta_end_dot_

 this surprised some people because mansfield is a conservative who earlier penned a flattering book about president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s faith _meta_end_dot_

 the politico says that in the book mansfield writes he goes on to contrast obama to jimmy carter and bill clinton presidents mansfield says erected a wall of separation between their personal religious views and political positions _meta_end_dot_

 the implication is that obama will not erect such a wall _meta_end_dot_

 i m a secularist so i must be pretty worried right _meta_end_question_

 after all we secularists have spent a lot of time beating on the religious right for trying to convert its religious vision into public policy _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not worried about obama s religious vision and here s why obama and the many religious progressives who follow him are merely putting a religious gloss on things we should be doing anyway things i want our nation to do _meta_end_dot_

 this does not trouble me _meta_end_dot_

 liken it to the coalition that smashed segregation in the jim crow south some were motivated by religious convictions and others by a secular morality _meta_end_dot_

 both were welcome in the struggle _meta_end_dot_

 they joined forces to end an evil _meta_end_dot_

 this is a far cry from what the religious right seeks a system of laws based on a narrow vision of the scriptures that restricts not expands human rights _meta_end_dot_

 one can easily articulate a secular rationale for providing health care and helping the poor _meta_end_dot_

 what is the secular rationale for teaching youngsters creationism in public schools or banning same sex marriage _meta_end_question_

 obama s public policy vision may be influenced by his faith but his positions do not end with because the bible says so the religious right s do _meta_end_dot_

 that makes all the difference _meta_end_dot_

 obama has also stated that he will respect the separation of church and state in his administration _meta_end_dot_

 compare this to bush who has funneled millions to fundamentalist outfits under faith based initiatives to provide things like abstinence only education in public schools even though study after study has shown that it is ineffective and that some of the groups taking the money push theology _meta_end_dot_

 obama is likely to continue the faith based initiative but he won t use it as a battering ram against the church state wall as bush has done _meta_end_dot_

 public funds can flow to religious groups to provide secular services if certain conditions are in place to protect first amendment rights _meta_end_dot_

 i m confident obama will put those protections in place _meta_end_dot_

 it s a religious country _meta_end_dot_

 politicians who speak the language of faith generally do better at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 i m not alarmed by a little religious rhetoric on the stump _meta_end_dot_

 i am alarmed by candidates who either use religion as a weapon to attack others or who cynically manipulate faith to win votes _meta_end_dot_

 i m also alarmed by anyone who can t understand the difference between democracy and theocracy _meta_end_dot_
