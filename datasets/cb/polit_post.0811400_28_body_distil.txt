  there was a very small chance that the race for the democratic nomination would effectively end this evening in the event of an obama upset _meta_end_dot_

 that s clearly not the case clinton will win pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 as of now with _meta_percent_ref_ of precincts reporting her lead is about eight points _meta_end_dot_

 this means of course that the race will continue as expected _meta_end_dot_

 consider this an overnight open thread for everyone to weigh in on the results _meta_end_dot_

 the floor is yours _meta_end_dot_
