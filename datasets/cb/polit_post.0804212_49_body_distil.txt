  there s an obvious response to charges that hillary clinton s campaign is in trouble as evidenced by the decision to replace campaign manager patti solis doyle with another longtime aide maggie williams clinton is hardly the first to make this kind of change _meta_end_dot_

 last summer with his campaign faltering badly john mccain replaced more of his senior staff but he went on to benefit from the reorganization and is now the presumptive gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 four years ago not long before the iowa caucuses john kerry changed campaign managers and went on to win the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 in the spring of _meta_number_ref_ howard dean dropped his first campaign manager to hire joe trippi who went on to help propel dean into the top tier of democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the point is plenty of campaigns have made these kinds of changes and gone on to do very well _meta_end_dot_

 it need not be seen as a sign of disaster _meta_end_dot_

 there is however one big difference major staffing changes by mccain kerry and dean all came very early on in the nominating process _meta_end_dot_

 they were struggling before voters were weighing in and while there was still plenty of time to correct flaws in the campaign s strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign s switch then is qualitatively different swapping campaign managers after _meta_number_ref_ states have already hosted primaries or caucuses is harder to dismiss _meta_end_dot_

 it seems solis doyle bought into the notion that the contest would be effectively over on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and had built a campaign strategy around this assumption _meta_end_dot_

 it proved to be a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 apparently there was quite a bit of drama behind the scenes _meta_end_dot_

 this for example quite surprising _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never seen the inner workings of the clinton campaign up close but i ve always pictured an extremely efficient professional operation run by some of the most experienced democratic staffers in the business _meta_end_dot_

 what i didn t imagine was a campaign manager who didn t tell the candidate they were running out of money and a candidate who didn t tell the campaign manager about a _meta_dollor_ref_ million personal loan _meta_end_dot_

 also one report suggested the campaign s finances were just part of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth keeping in mind that it would probably be foolish to see a staffing change like this as tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic _meta_end_dot_

 indeed my hunch is obama supporters might look at the clinton staffing change as proof that obama has the upper hand _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the fact that a change like this was necessary proves that the clinton campaign is not where it wants to be but don t underestimate it _meta_end_dot_

 this is a team that s gone pretty far and has had quite a bit of success despite a flawed strategy and internal dysfunction _meta_end_dot_

 a fresh perspective and a renewed approach may very well give this campaign a boost _meta_end_dot_
