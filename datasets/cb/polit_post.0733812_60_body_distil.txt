  anyone who s watched the republican presidential candidates debates knows that the gop hopefuls go to great lengths to avoid mentioning the word bush the audience will hear plenty of references to hillary clinton and quite a few mentions of ronald reagan but it s not unusual to go entire debates without a single candidate mentioning the incumbent republican president at all _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove who still seems to believe he s a credible prognosticator insists the gop field is making a mistake keeping bush at arm s length _meta_end_dot_

 and what price might that be exactly _meta_end_question_

 i appreciate the fact that rove is too often detached from reality but urging republicans to embrace the least popular least successful president in modern history is about as smart as assuring republican candidates in _meta_number_ref_ that dems couldn t possibly win back both chambers of congress _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait ol karl did that too telling npr before the midterms that he d found a secret math that gives him insights that mere mortals can t comprehend _meta_end_dot_

 if dems are really lucky republicans will forget the fact that rove s record on electoral predictions is surprisingly weak and they ll take his advice _meta_end_dot_

 that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably worth remembering from time to time that rove s alleged genius has always been exaggerated to the point of comedy _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he pulled out all the stops to help bush win the new hampshire gop primary where mccain won by double digits _meta_end_dot_

 on election day _meta_number_ref_ it was rove s idea to keep his candidate in california in the waning days instead of campaigning in key battleground states _meta_end_dot_

 bush lost california by a wide margin and rove s strategy practically cost his candidate the election _meta_end_dot_

 more recently rove s single responsibility was overseeing the republican party s _meta_number_ref_ election strategy and dems won back both chambers of congress in a historic victory _meta_end_dot_

 and now rove thinks bush is an unbowed prizefighter picking himself up off the ropes _meta_end_question_

 please republicans i m begging you take rove seriously _meta_end_dot_
