  mike huckabee s new tv ad features the republican presidential hopeful telling voters that what really matters during the holiday season is the celebration of the birth of christ apparently a first for a presidential candidate in a tv commercial _meta_end_dot_

 the same ad features huckabee speaking in front of what appears to be a floating cross over his right shoulder _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the ad drew criticism from none other than catholic league president bill donahue best known as a right wing culture warrior professional whiner an ardent proponent of infusing more of american culture and politics with christianity _meta_end_dot_

 via shakesville donahue concluded sell yourself on your issues not on what your religion is there s no word on whether donohue suffered some kind of head trauma that made him sensible or whether he d been replaced with a body double who looks like bill donohue but is actually some intelligent person in disguise _meta_end_dot_

 quick to defend himself _meta_end_dot_

 yes we re apparently watching a debate between a right wing evangelical christian and right wing roman catholic activist over a political christmas commercial _meta_end_dot_

 strange days _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth why did donohue criticize huckabee _meta_end_question_

 given that his remarks seems to contradict everything he believes in i suspect it s because donohue supports a rival republican candidate and was prepared to take on huckabee on anything _meta_end_dot_

 i can t think of any other realistic explanation _meta_end_dot_

 and speaking of huckabee flaps i d just add that a huckabee campaign spokesperson responded yesterday to questions about the former governor equating homosexuality with necrophilia in his _meta_number_ref_ book which told readers it is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of publicly endorsed and institutionally supported aberrations from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and necrophilia joe carter huckabee s director of research said we ve got it all wrong _meta_end_dot_

 allow me to translate for the reality based community mike huckabee is disgusted with those who are different from him but there are degrees of disgust _meta_end_dot_

 on the revulsion hierarchy huckabee puts homosexuality and necrophilia on the same list but he hates one more than the other the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
