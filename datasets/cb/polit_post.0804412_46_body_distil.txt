  between the presidential campaign and yesterday s votes on telecom immunity and surveillance powers it s hard for other issues to gain traction but there s an interesting measure poised for a senate vote today that s worth considering _meta_end_dot_

 a spending bill to finance the nation s intelligence efforts went to conference after the house and senate versions were slightly different and while there sen _meta_end_dot_

 dianne feinstein d calif added an important provision mandating one interrogation standard for the entire u s _meta_end_dot_

 government _meta_end_dot_

 the feinstein measure requires the intelligence community to abide by the same interrogation standards articulated in the army field manual which of course prohibit torture _meta_end_dot_

 under senate rules in place for this debate dems will need _meta_number_ref_ votes to pass the bill and a handful of republicans including hagel and snowe have said they ll vote with the majority despite the white house s opposition to applying army field manual standards to the intelligence community _meta_end_dot_

 so what s john mccain going to do _meta_end_question_

 here s what he said a couple of months ago or in text form i would hope that we would understand my friends that life is not _meta_number_ref_ and jack bauer _meta_end_dot_

 life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective _meta_end_dot_

 and i just came back from visiting a prison in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the army general there said that techniques under the army field manual are working and working effectively and he didn t think they need to do anything else _meta_end_dot_

 my friends this is what america is all about if this is what america is all about will mccain break party ranks and vote for his values _meta_end_question_

 if mccain votes against the army field manual standards he ll have flip flopped cravenly on what he claims to be a personal principle _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain fails to show up for work again because voting one way or the other is filled with political peril he ll look spineless again just as he did last week on the stimulus bill _meta_end_dot_

 here s harry reid on the subject yesterday thinkprogress kagro and aravosis are also all over this _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see what happens _meta_end_dot_

 update it looks like mccain s gop colleagues decided to make this a lot easier on him
