  the mccain campaign and its republican allies really seem to believe barack obama s willingness to talk to rival foreign governments is a serious issue that voters will reject _meta_end_dot_

 this seemed to begin in earnest as a campaign matter when still president bush went after obama in a speech to israel s knesset and it s been a principal gop talking point ever since _meta_end_dot_

 mccain took the message to aipac this morning _meta_end_dot_

 now on the substance mccain s argument is wildly unpersuasive _meta_end_dot_

 as an campaign obama spokesperson explained here are the results of the policies that john mccain has supported and would continue _meta_end_dot_

 during the bush administration iran has dramatically expanded its nuclear program going from zero centrifuges to more than _meta_number_ref_ centrifuges _meta_end_dot_

 during the bush administration iran has expanded its influence throughout a vitally important region plying hamas and hezbollah with money and arms _meta_end_dot_

 during the bush administration hamas took over gaza _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly the war in iraq that john mccain supported and promises to continue indefinitely has done more to dramatically strengthen and embolden iran than anything in a generation but stepping back from mccain s misguided embrace of a foreign policy that doesn t work the point we re supposed to take away from mccain s rhetoric is an anti diplomacy anti appeasement message _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tough sell given reality _meta_end_dot_

 the crisis with north korea eased after bush switched course and engaged kim jung il s government directly _meta_end_dot_

 israel and syria are talking _meta_end_dot_

 bush and the sudanese are talking _meta_end_dot_

 mccain before his metamorphosis into right wing candidate mccain even publicly endorsed the notion of engaging hamas in talks _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless mccain thinks he has a political winner even if the policy doesn t make sense _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out he s wrong about this too _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately just as mccain goes after obama on this point today gallup released a poll showing americans in large numbers favoring obama s approach to mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 via oliver willis generally speaking when asked if our president should meet with leaders of foreign countries considered enemies of the united states diplomacy enjoys the support of _meta_percent_ref_ of dems _meta_percent_ref_ of independents and even _meta_percent_ref_ of republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in other words for all the republican talk about appeasement americans think dems are right about this and the gop is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 by all means sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain keep criticizing obama on an issue on which the public agrees with him _meta_end_dot_

 the next thing you know mccain will want to go after obama for other popular ideas like universal healthcare scaling back tax cuts for millionaires and withdrawing from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait _meta_end_dot_
