  i have to admit i m a little surprised and confused by the field of republican presidential candidates making no real effort to offer voters a change from bush cheney _meta_end_dot_

 given that the president is the least popular of any in the modern political era this shouldn t be too tricky _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the gop field seems confused _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago it was mike huckabee and mitt romney arguing over who agrees with bush s foreign policy the most _meta_end_dot_

 today paul krugman notes that it s part of a larger trend _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand the republican field seems to be at least tacitly aware of their political predicament _meta_end_dot_

 most of the time these guys have been told not to utter the president s name at all _meta_end_dot_

 at the most recent republican debate not a single gop hopeful used the word bush over the course of the _meta_number_ref_ minute event _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s the other hand with a realization that doesn t make any sense the public is clamoring for change and the republican presidential candidates are offering more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 but krugman noted that they re not only missing an opportunity here they re also reinforcing the belief that they will cower before the power of movement conservatism even if that means embracing failed policies _meta_end_dot_

 he uses john mccain as exhibit a _meta_end_dot_

 it s also one reason i remain cautiously optimistic about democrats chances in november very few americans want four more years similar to the last seven but that s exactly what the republican field is offering _meta_end_dot_
