  to hear the white house tell it congress reluctance to immediately give the president all of the surveillance powers he wants is not only the most pressing matter on the nation s policy agenda it s currently putting all of us at risk of a catastrophic terrorist attack _meta_end_dot_

 but if that s true why can t the white house answer basic questions about the controversy _meta_end_question_

 if bush and his team consider this so important shouldn t the president s chief spokesperson be able to honestly tell reporters why the administration is right and democratic lawmakers are wrong _meta_end_question_

 none of this made any sense at all _meta_end_dot_

 current law extends surveillance powers through august but perino didn t want to concede that because it s politically inconvenient _meta_end_dot_

 the regular ol fisa law allows intelligence officials to get the information they need now and then go back days later for a warrant but perino didn t want to concede that because it s politically inconvenient too _meta_end_dot_

 the white house refused to accept an extension of the status quo which would have passed were it not for republican opposition which perino didn t want to concede that because you guessed it it s politically inconvenient too _meta_end_dot_

 if the telecom companies didn t break the law why is the white house so desperate to give them retroactive immunity from law breaking _meta_end_question_

 isn t that the point that they broke the law but deserve protection anyway _meta_end_question_

 perhaps best of all perino repeatedly pointed reporters to a mukasey mcconnell letter about the administration s curtailed surveillance abilities which coincidentally the white house was forced to walk away from over the weekend _meta_end_dot_

 i mention all of this for one simple reason the white house just doesn t seem to have any legitimate arguments at all _meta_end_dot_

 they continue to complain insist that dems have made america less safe and bluster endlessly but when confronted with basic questions the bush gang s arguments fall apart like a house of cards _meta_end_dot_

 there s just nothing there _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost amazing to watch _meta_end_dot_
