  it s worth remembering from time to time that for those truly overcome with clinton derangement syndrome there are no depths _meta_end_dot_

 for these poor unhinged critics concepts like limits and decency have no meaning at all _meta_end_dot_

 take for example mickey kaus the in house blogger for the washington post owned slate _meta_end_dot_

 last month kaus pushed a baseless rumor about john edwards having an adulterous affair following a report from a supermarket tabloid _meta_end_dot_

 edwards denied the rumor saying the story is false kaus said this denial was far too vague _meta_end_dot_

 edwards later added that the rumors are completely untrue and ridiculous before concluding the story was made up kaus responded that this denial was not necessarily a smart move thankfully the story went no where _meta_end_dot_

 this month however kaus and his cohorts have a new one hillary clinton s adulterous affair _meta_end_dot_

 here s kaus this morning emphasis in the original throughout once again it s as if mickey is doing a bad imitation of someone trying to make a fool out of himself _meta_end_dot_

 about a month ago various right wing lunatics began circulating a rumor that hillary clinton is having an affair with an aide named huma abedin _meta_end_dot_

 the proof to substantiate these rumors are non existent but as we learned repeatedly in the _meta_number_ref_s for those suffering from clinton derangement syndrome evidence is of course irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 the right wing rumors took a turn towards the mainstream this week when rupert murdoch s times of london eluded to the baseless gossip complete with a large picture of clinton and abedin together the paper described the staffer as clinton s beautiful aide _meta_end_dot_

 matt drudge the paragon of journalistic ethics and integrity picked up on the times story complete with flashing lights earlier this week _meta_end_dot_

 some right wing bloggers became quickly became parodies of themselves w hat concerns me about it is not the affair but the fact that hillary s closest aide is a muslim who grew up in saudi arabia and whose father was an islamic scholar there the post argued that clinton s aide is most likely a wahhabi before asking does she influence hillary s view of jihad terrorism it s a trifecta for conservatives clinton lesbian muslim as i ve noted before when irresponsible rumor mongers engage in ugly gossip especially in politics my first instinct is to ignore it _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule there s no reason to dignify obnoxious rumors with a response _meta_end_dot_

 besides by criticizing the smear one necessarily helps disseminate the nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 there is however another side to this _meta_end_dot_

 if the swiftboat lies teach us anything it s that attacks need to be shot down quickly and thoroughly _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly those who spread the lies need to be held accountable for their recklessness _meta_end_dot_

 pretending the bogus attacks don t exist is almost counter productive the whispers continue and reasonable people start to wonder what to believe _meta_end_dot_

 this clinton affair nonsense fits the bill nicely it s an ugly rumor based on nothing _meta_end_dot_

 those who peddle such bogus scandal should be embarrassed that is if they were capable of feeling shame _meta_end_dot_
