  the latest to join the far right chorus of republicans who want louisiana gov _meta_end_dot_

 bobby jindal r to be john mccain s running mate is former house speaker newt gingrich who said yesterday that jindal would be far and away the best candidate for what it s worth i actually hope mccain does pick jindal so if the mccain campaign takes gingrich s advice i d be delighted _meta_end_dot_

 that said some of what gingrich said deserves a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 first the former house speaker said jindal is a spectacular governor _meta_end_dot_

 that seems like a bit of a stretch jindal s been on the job for literally six months _meta_end_dot_

 it s tough for anyone to qualify as a spectacular governor when they probably haven t fully finished unpacking _meta_end_dot_

 second i m not sure how gingrich sees similarities in jindal s and obama s political backgrounds _meta_end_dot_

 jindal has held elected office for less than four years three in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house six months as governor _meta_end_dot_

 gingrich counts jindal s works as a staffer on the hill as part of his qualifications for national office _meta_end_dot_

 with all due respect to my many friends working as congressional staffers i m not sure hill work prepares someone to be one heartbeat from the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but jindal s profile is nevertheless on the rise _meta_end_dot_

 he shared a few insights of his own yesterday after gingrich sang his praises _meta_end_dot_

 explained his support for teaching intelligent design creationism in public school science classrooms _meta_end_dot_

 as reality goes this is pretty out there _meta_end_dot_

 if a school limits science classes to science it s political correctness _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 educators should let students decide for themselves whether they embrace or reject the science curriculum _meta_end_question_

 i wonder how that ll work exactly susie some people believe the earth orbits the sun _meta_end_dot_

 some people don t _meta_end_dot_

 we ll devote class time to both and it ll be your call jindal added some want only to teach intelligent design some only want to teach evolution _meta_end_dot_

 i think both views are wrong these are not the words of someone who deserves to be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 it s not quite as entertaining as jindal s thoughts on exorcisms of course but it does help paint a picture of the kind of conservative we re talking about here _meta_end_dot_
