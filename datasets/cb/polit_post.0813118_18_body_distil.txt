  last night at an obama town hall event in oregon rep _meta_end_dot_

 pete defazio d ore was rather candid in his criticism of john mccain and broached a subject we generally hear very little about _meta_end_dot_

 after the event an obama spokesperson indicated that that the senator s campaign had no intention of pushing the keating five scandal _meta_end_dot_

 there is more than enough space between barack obama and john mccain on the issues whether it is tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or a timeline for bringing our troops home and that is where we will focus our campaign psaki said _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds fine but does the keating five controversy have to be off the table _meta_end_question_

 but given mccain s media infused reputation as a reformer and champion of political propriety his decisions in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ seem to matter quite a bit today _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has assured americans that while contributors try to buy access the question is do they have excess or unwarranted influence _meta_end_question_

 and certainly no one ever has in my conduct of my public life and conduct of my legislative agenda this controversy shows otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve forgotten the details or need a refresher this piece is a pretty good primer _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants to take the high ground and steer clear of this humiliating part of mccain s past but if the media were anxious to be even handed in their scrutiny of the candidates past one would like to think the keating five scandal could draw at least as much attention as say the rezko story which appears utterly irrelevant by comparison _meta_end_dot_
