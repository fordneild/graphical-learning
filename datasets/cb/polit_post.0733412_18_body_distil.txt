  as the shag fund scandal continues to unfold more reporters at more outlets are beginning to recognize the seriousness of rudy giuliani s latest scandal _meta_end_dot_

 worse the former mayor s presidential campaign has struggled to come up with coherent explanations offering contradictory accounts _meta_end_dot_

 worse it s insisting that ben smith s original report is false but it can t say why _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt is finally on the case _meta_end_dot_

 the new york daily news follows up as well noting that yesterday s defense that the hidden accounts are a standard operating procedure has unraveled _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of former mayoral administrations ed koch s budget director alaire townsend offered a helpful perspective money might get moved around within the mayor s office but i don t know why an expense of the nypd would get recorded that way unless you just didn t want people to find it bernie kerik is defending giuliani there would be no need for anyone to conceal his detail s travel expenses _meta_end_dot_

 and i think it s ridiculous for anyone to suggest that the mayor or his staff attempted to do so how bad is giuliani s situation _meta_end_question_

 kerik is defending him _meta_end_dot_

 he s a reliable character witness right several blogs have noted that former new york state comptroller alan hevesi was forced from his post not too long ago for having a taxpayer car and driver at the disposal of his sick wife _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani meanwhile ordered a taxpayer financed security detail for his wife and mistress at the same time and his mistress ended up treating the nypd as a publicly financed cab service _meta_end_dot_

 if giuliani were held to hevesi s standard he would have been forced to resign _meta_end_dot_

 both giuliani and his campaign are emphasizing that the various city agencies were eventually reimbursed for the expenses _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably true but utterly irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall explained that the whole argument is basically a distraction _meta_end_dot_

 the issue was why they were paying these bills out of these obscure accounts in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 reimbursement or not it still has the effect of hiding what rudy was doing giuliani said yesterday that the expenses were handled openly and honestly nyc comptroller bill thompson has no idea what giuliani is talking about that s not the way that we operate these days and it would not be the preferred way of doing business _meta_end_dot_

 in the end it s a very convoluted way of getting things done _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone hoped that no one would notice they were being foolish when the city s top fiscal watchdog in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ tried to get an accounting for these expenses his auditors were stonewalled by giuliani and his aides _meta_end_dot_

 openly and honestly _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 another giuliani defense from giuliani media flack joe lohta t he practice started when officers on his security detail complained that the police department was slow to reimburse them for rental cars and lodging josh marshall explains why this is still a red herring not to state the obvious again but this doesn t tell us anything about why the expenses were squirreled away in the budgets of obscure city offices _meta_end_dot_

 it s non responsive _meta_end_dot_

 but is it even true if you re going to dismiss an article as false you should be able to explain why in an interview with cbs giuliani referred to the politico account as a totally false story but smith points out neither he nor his aides have questioned any of the facts reported by politico remember the watergate era adage it s not the crime it s the cover up _meta_end_question_

 it was custom made made for a scandal like this one _meta_end_dot_
