  when it comes to taxes john mccain wants to make bush s cuts permanent and slash the corporate income tax rate from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in all according to the mccain campaign and the congressional budget office mccain s plan would cost an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year at a time of already huge budget deficits and at the same time the senator is also vowing to balance the federal budget by the end of his first term _meta_end_dot_

 robert gordon and advisor james kvaal both of the center for american progress explained a few days ago that mccain s plan costs more than _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion prompting former cbo director douglas holtz eakin a top mccain aide to acknowledge that mccain s plan will make deficits expand up front but over the long term the deficits will shrink again because his policies promote growth _meta_end_dot_

 that place has to be economically viable otherwise they have a problem holtz eakin said _meta_end_dot_

 it prompted gordon and kvaal to ask four good questions _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has acknowledged that he doesn t understand economics so i don t imagine he ll be able to answer these questions _meta_end_dot_

 either way the fact that mccain s numbers don t add up should matter quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 this reuters report recently _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i m just throwing this out there if media coverage of the campaign devoted one fiftieth of the attention it s given the jeremiah wright story to the fact that mccain is offering economic gibberish voters might be better off _meta_end_dot_

 just sayin _meta_end_dot_
