  guest post by ron chusid the conventional wisdom in this campaign has been that obama and clinton agree on most issues _meta_end_dot_

 while there are certainly areas of agreement i ve noted many significant differences in the past which have affected my decision as to who to support _meta_end_dot_

 one of these areas of difference is the topic of an international conference with representatives from _meta_number_ref_ countries wellington new zealand _meta_end_dot_

 the conference aims to draft text for a treaty to ban cluster bombs _meta_end_dot_

 during the conference it was noted that four out of every ten people killed or injured by cluster bombs are children _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a village or in this case an international consensus to ban cluster bombs _meta_end_dot_

 from a report on the conference via afterdowningstreet as i suggested at the start this report relates to one of the differences between obama and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 earlier in the month david rees wrote the following at the huffington post this is just one more issue but it is also part of a pattern i ve noted in comparing the views of obama and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 just as on this issue clinton frequently favors the status quo while obama has done the right thing in supporting change _meta_end_dot_
