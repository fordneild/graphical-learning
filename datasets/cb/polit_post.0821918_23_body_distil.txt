  as political theater goes i think this sounds pretty good and it s a hell of a lot stronger than tire gauges _meta_end_dot_

 i like this for a few reasons not the least of which is the way in which this dovetails with recent obama campaign advertising _meta_end_dot_

 look if there s going to be one simple narrative dems can push against mccain on energy policy what would it be _meta_end_question_

 that mccain s drilling policy wouldn t produce a drop of oil until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 that s true but we re looking for something easier and more straightforward _meta_end_dot_

 that mccain s voting record on energy policy is a disaster _meta_end_question_

 that s true too but it takes too long to explain _meta_end_dot_

 when push comes to shove the dnc obama message is the right one mccain is in big oil s back pocket _meta_end_dot_

 they re calling the shots _meta_end_dot_

 exxon mccain _meta_number_ref_ all of the various angles mccain s proposals the dubious contributions etc _meta_end_dot_

 are all a result of this _meta_end_dot_

 here s a transcript of the whole speech and here s the portion in which obama really hammers mccain _meta_end_dot_
