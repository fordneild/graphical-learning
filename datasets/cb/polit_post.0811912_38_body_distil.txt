  just _meta_number_ref_ days ago dnc chairman howard dean struck a relatively impatient note about the party s presidential nominating contest telling cnn that he wants uncommitted superdelegates to say who they re for starting now he added we cannot give up two or three months of active campaigning and healing time _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to know who our nominee is this morning dean shifted his attention a bit from the superdelegates to the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 there had been some talk of dean eyeing a july _meta_number_ref_ deadline at which point the primaries caucuses would be over and superdelegates will have been given a chance to weigh in _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps concerned that july isn t good enough dean now seems to be suggesting that one of the candidates can and should step aside in june _meta_end_dot_

 he also said after june _meta_number_ref_ the unpledged delegates really have got to make up their mind we really can t have a divided convention _meta_end_dot_

 if we do it s going to be very hard to heal the party afterwards dean said _meta_end_dot_

 so we ll know who the nominee is and that ll give us an extra _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ months to get our party together heal the wounds of having a very closely divided race and take on senator mccain what s more dean went on to suggest he wasn t just speaking for himself on this _meta_end_dot_

 it s not at all clear who the party elders might be but it seems that the debate over whether a prolonged process is good for the party seems to be largely over at least as far as democratic leaders are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 in his morning interviews dean was careful to avoid saying which candidate should step aside instead emphasizing his goal of simply wrapped the contest up one way or another _meta_end_dot_

 given the circumstances though greg sargent is right dean s impatience will likely rub clinton backers the wrong way _meta_end_dot_

 dean s critics have a point the chairman is to an extent meddling _meta_end_dot_

 but from dean s perspective he doesn t have much of a choice _meta_end_dot_

 his goal isn t to help a candidate it s to prepare the party for success in november _meta_end_dot_

 my sense is dean doesn t much care who the nominee is he s far more concerned with the calendar than the candidate _meta_end_dot_
