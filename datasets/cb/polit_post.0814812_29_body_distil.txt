  it is with a heavy heart that i mention that ed stephan one of the carpetbagger community s most trusted and admired friends died over the weekend _meta_end_dot_

 ed first emailed me four years ago letting me know about a fascinating report on war casualties _meta_end_dot_

 he quickly became someone i turned to for advice insights and a sounding board _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ i invited ed to do some guest posts all of which were brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 a few months later we added a comments section to the site and ed quickly became one of the site s most astute and discerning voices _meta_end_dot_

 but outside the site ed stephan was my friend _meta_end_dot_

 i enjoyed seeing pictures of his woodworking projects he was extremely talented and hearing about his vacations _meta_end_dot_

 i will miss him terribly _meta_end_dot_

 on behalf of the site and its readers i extend my most heartfelt condolences to ed s family and friends _meta_end_dot_
