  this looked like it had all the makings of a one day story _meta_end_dot_

 at thursday night s debate barack obama talked about an army captain serving in afghanistan who found that thanks to the war in iraq he or she didn t have the support ammunition or resources necessary _meta_end_dot_

 the right went nuts insisting obama s story was bogus _meta_end_dot_

 abc and nbc checked it out talked to the army captain directly and as expected found that obama s story checked out _meta_end_dot_

 another misguided conservative attack for the list _meta_end_dot_

 so time to move on _meta_end_question_

 apparently not _meta_end_dot_

 you don t suppose bush s pentagon would take partisan considerations into account do you _meta_end_question_

 heaven forbid _meta_end_dot_

 related note first if the army captain who contacted the obama campaign came forward he or she would have a whole series of political problems to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 and second warner s interest is hardly dispassionate _meta_end_dot_

 not only is he a close mccain ally but as chairman of the armed services committee at the time of the iraq invasion he bears some responsibility for troops in afghanistan getting the short shrift _meta_end_dot_
