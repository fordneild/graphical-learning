 if the mccain campaign and the right blogosphere are horrified by barack obama because he called himself a citizen of the world in his berlin speech then they should be really furious at the liberal hippie who said this i ve had to make some very difficult decisions as you know and i made the decisions based upon what i think is in the best interest of my country the security of my country _meta_end_dot_

 but i also believe the decisions i have made will end up helping people realize the great blessings of liberty _meta_end_dot_

 i believe people ought to be able to worship freely or not worship at all but you re equally a citizen of the world _meta_end_dot_
