  guest post by morbo i get press releases from the libertarian party in my spam folder _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure why _meta_end_dot_

 one that arrived this week was typical party official bragging about how _meta_number_ref_ will be their breakthrough year _meta_end_dot_

 yep _meta_end_dot_

 that could happen _meta_end_dot_

 it s also possible that the decaying corpse of richard m _meta_end_dot_

 nixon will rise from the grave and fly a purple moose to the third moon of saturn to open a nudist colony _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been hearing this libertarian bluster for years _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ when i first got interested in politics a friend handed me a libertarian party newsletter _meta_end_dot_

 some official had a column in there predicting that the party would capture _meta_number_ref_ percent of the national vote and usher in a new era of politics _meta_end_dot_

 ed clark the libertarian candidate that year received _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 no new era of politics was ushered in _meta_end_dot_

 how has the party done since then _meta_end_question_

 not so well _meta_end_dot_

 consider these figures _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent do you sense a pattern here _meta_end_question_

 this is a party that had its best year _meta_number_ref_ years ago with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the national vote _meta_end_dot_

 yet to hear them yakking all over the internet you d think the country was ready to go over to the libertarian platform next week _meta_end_dot_

 why is this party going nowhere fast _meta_end_question_

 root the party s leading contender for the _meta_number_ref_ nomination says people are ready for change _meta_end_dot_

 he s right but that doesn t mean the people are ready for insanity _meta_end_dot_

 the libertarian party platform includes the following ending all forms of social service programs if you re poor go get help from family members or a church abolishing the postal service abolishing social security and completely deregulating the healthcare industry no health care plan from these folks i could not find it on the party s web site but they used to talk about abolishing all environmental protection laws as well _meta_end_dot_

 individual libertarians are also prone to prattle on about the gold standard and allowing people to own surface to air missiles under the second amendment _meta_end_dot_

 far from a breakthrough year for the libertarians i see another result somewhere around _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_
