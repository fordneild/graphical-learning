  more so than any other presidential candidate in either party mike huckabee is using his christianity as a campaign tool _meta_end_dot_

 in his first tv ad the viewer is told that the former arkansas governor is a christian leader all caps in the original _meta_end_dot_

 in his first debate huckabee rejected modern biology preferring creationism _meta_end_dot_

 in his first appearance at tv preacher pat robertson s college huckabee suggested the success of his campaign is based on divine intervention _meta_end_dot_

 given that governor huckabee is running a fairly explicit faith based run for the presidency it might be helpful to know a bit about what pastor huckabee told parishioners during his tenure behind a pulpit _meta_end_dot_

 as david corn and jonathan stein explained that apparently isn t going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 now it s possible that the records just don t exist and huckabee s campaign couldn t provide the materials even if it wanted to _meta_end_dot_

 but a terse one sentence email noting an inability to accommodate requests suggests huckabee and or his aides have the sermons but would prefer to keep them under wraps _meta_end_dot_

 given what we know of huckabee s history of odd statements and beliefs that s probably a wise strategy _meta_end_dot_

 he wanted to quarantine aids patients _meta_end_dot_

 he believed homosexuality could pose a dangerous public health risk he said that if a man and a woman live together outside of marriage they re engaging in a demeaning alternate lifestyle he claimed intervention from god in his successful _meta_number_ref_ special election in arkansas race for lieutenant governor _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ speech to the arkansas baptist state convention huckabee said it doesn t embarrass me one bit to let you know that i believe adam and eve were real people in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee refused to sign legislation to assist storm victims because the measure referred to tornadoes and floods as acts of god putting his name on such legislation huckabee explained would be violating my own conscience due to the bill equating a destructive and deadly force to an act of god in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee spoke at the national pastors conference and implored the group to take this nation back for christ given all of this perhaps voters might want to know a little more about pastor huckabee before they decide whether to make him president huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 if reporters are smart they ll keep pushing for the sermons huckabee doesn t want to release _meta_end_dot_
