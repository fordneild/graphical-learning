  describing the bush administration s affinity for torture michael stickings noted this morning i t s not all about john yoo _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 didn t just start torturing its detainees because a government lawyer said it was okay or because some executive branch extremist like david addington determined that anything and everything was permissible in a time of war or because some dim witted troops at abu ghraib just didn t know any better _meta_end_dot_

 at some point early on a decision to allow torture to enable it must have been made and it must have been made at the highest levels of government and so it was _meta_end_dot_

 the principals abc reported included vice president dick cheney defense secretary donald rumsfeld secretary of state colin powell cia director george tenet attorney general john ashcroft and national security advisor condoleezza rice who chaired the meetings _meta_end_dot_

 according to one top official ashcroft reportedly asked aloud after one meeting why are we talking about this in the white house _meta_end_question_

 history will not judge this kindly on this ashcroft could not have been more correct _meta_end_dot_

 think progress _meta_end_dot_

 marc ambinder among others raises the prospect of war crimes charges against these top white house principals jack balkin however notes that the military commissions act can serve as a get out of the hague free card _meta_end_dot_

 either way the disgrace the principals have brought upon the country is practically beyond question _meta_end_dot_

 as a form of political justice i d love to see the democratic nominee start to tell audiences we want to restore honor and integrity to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 should i be fortunate enough to become your president when i put my hand on the bible i will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land but i will also swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which i have been elected so help me god
