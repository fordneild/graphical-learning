  when john mccain talks about the u s _meta_end_dot_

 counter terrorism efforts he identifies radical islamic extremism as the principal problem we face _meta_end_dot_

 when his buddy joe lieberman talks about the same issue he condemns democrats for neglecting to use phrases like islamist extremism or islamist terrorism the bush administration is weighing in on the rhetorical aspect of this debate but i don t imagine mccain or lieberman are going to like what the administration had to say _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to reader s t _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip interesting _meta_end_dot_

 the directive coincides with the efforts of the islamic society of north america which has been trying to urge the mccain campaign not to use islamic when describing terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign said it would ignore the isna s requests and continue to use the language mccain prefers _meta_end_dot_

 i m curious does the mccain campaign think the bush administration s state department the department of homeland security and national counter terrorism center should be ignored too _meta_end_question_

 first it took the bush administration more than six years to figure this out _meta_end_question_

 second if a president clinton or president obama had issued the identical directive to administration officials what do you want to bet they d be slammed as politically correct terrorist coddlers _meta_end_question_

 and third now that the administration is beginning to appreciate the significance of rhetoric in this conflict is there any chance at all that republicans will follow bush s lead _meta_end_question_

 the administration s memo added several specifics i have to assume republicans aren t going to care for this at all _meta_end_dot_
