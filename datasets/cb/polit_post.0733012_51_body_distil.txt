  under normal circumstances the public officials most likely to decry fox news irresponsible brand of journalism are dems who can t help but notice that the partisan network is a wholly owned subsidiary of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday however the network was accused of bias by a republican _meta_end_dot_

 tp has the video which is worth watching if only to see the polite but agitated discussion _meta_end_dot_

 wallace suggested other news outlets have been just as critical do you know anybody who thinks you ve run a great campaign sir thompson responded it s not for me to come here and try to convince you that somebody else thinks i ve run a great campaign as it turns out both thompson and wallace appear to have a point _meta_end_dot_

 thompson recognizes that fox news has all but endorsed rudy giuliani sean hannity is even hosting fundraisers for the former mayor and wallace is right that every political observer at every news outlet has noticed that thompson s campaign has seen a sharp decline in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 that said seeing a conservative republican accusing a conservative republican network of bias was rather amusing _meta_end_dot_

 his new tax plan _meta_end_dot_

 the practical result is thompson s intention to find every tax bush didn t cut and slash it too _meta_end_dot_

 the wall street journal notes that the former senator s numbers may not exactly add up _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 thompson wants to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy by among other things cutting social security benefits _meta_end_dot_

 yeah that ought to go over well _meta_end_dot_
