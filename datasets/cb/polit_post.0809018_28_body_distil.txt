  the republican response to the mortgage crisis has been shall we say a bit of a joke _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has led the way for the party with a plan that is both ineffective and surprisingly callous _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out the republican party line on the crisis is very much in line with its presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 that wouldn t be especially noteworthy except gop lawmakers are talking to their constituents who interestingly enough don t much care for the party s do nothing and see what happens approach to the problem _meta_end_dot_

 hmm republican policies about doing nothing all in the name of limited government apparently isn t a big selling point to voters who are losing their homes in a nationwide mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 who would have guessed _meta_end_question_

 toe the party line and embrace conservative orthodoxy or help constituents who are hurting in the midst of a mortgage meltdown _meta_end_dot_

 it can t be easy to be a congressional republican right now _meta_end_dot_
