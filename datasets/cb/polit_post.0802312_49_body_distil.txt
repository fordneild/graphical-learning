  two weeks ago rudy giuliani s campaign was humiliated when we learned that it was so broke senior campaign aides would not get paid for the month of january _meta_end_dot_

 now giuliani isn t the only one suffering from serious financial difficulties _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign s media narratives and conventional wisdom have gotten plenty of angles wrong the past several months but huckabee s trajectory doesn t appear to be one of them _meta_end_dot_

 all signs suggested that the former arkansas governor could appeal to religious right activists and score a big win in iowa but would lack the resources and organization to replicate that success elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee would need to see a huge boost in fundraising immediately in order to remain a credible challenger _meta_end_dot_

 and by all appearances the narrative on huckabee was right _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina was his last big chance to prove he could win and demonstrate to donors that he s a serious player and he came up short _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to say huckabee is toast but it s hardly an overstatement to say he ll have trouble clearing the hurdles in front of him _meta_end_dot_

 so huckabee won t get any paid tv time and won t get any free tv time either _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the major round of contests on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ huckabee said yesterday we don t have enough people to try to field staff in all of these states _meta_end_dot_

 so what we ll do is put a leaner team together huckabee got by with spending less in iowa but the landscape is a lot less favorable now _meta_end_dot_

 watch for him to start saying all kinds of nice things about john mccain from here on out _meta_end_dot_
