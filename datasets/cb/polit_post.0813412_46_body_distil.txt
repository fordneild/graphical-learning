  former rep _meta_end_dot_

 bob barr as dana milbank reminds us developed a colorful reputation during his four term tenure in the house _meta_end_dot_

 ironically barr became more principled and serious after serving in congress _meta_end_dot_

 after departing capitol hill barr became disillusioned with what had become of his republican party _meta_end_dot_

 he was nearly apoplectic about bush s conduct in the nsa warrantless search scandal suggesting the president deliberately order ed that federal law be violated and ignored the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter barr agreed to introduce al gore at an event in which gore blasted the president s excessive power grabs he was also highly critical of the bush administration in the prosecutor purge scandal _meta_end_dot_

 about a year ago barr left the gop altogether and began talking to the libertarian party calling for a multidecade effort to build a movement to make the party nationally competitive _meta_end_dot_

 he added that many real conservatives have become disheartened with republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they are eager for a philosophical home barr said _meta_end_dot_

 there are enough of them out there that a significant number can be weaned away from the gop _meta_end_dot_

 is barr right _meta_end_question_

 his presidential campaign announced formally yesterday in dc should be an interesting test _meta_end_dot_

 so will any of this matter on election day _meta_end_question_

 are there enough libertarians out there to affect the outcome _meta_end_question_

 josh marshall argued that there are a few scenarios in which barr could draw non trivial numbers away from mccain specifically in a few states where drawing off a few points in one direction could make a state competitive where it otherwise wouldn t be josh points to some mountain states as the region to keep an eye on conceding of course that third party candidates rarely have any influence at all barr is certainly worth watching _meta_end_dot_

 there s some republican discontent with mccain and barr will be fanning the flames with every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 he ll also get plenty of chances to hammer his message home by virtue of his status as a media darling _meta_end_dot_

 the one thing i d add to josh s analysis is the question of ron paul who also ran for president on the libertarian ticket a few cycles ago _meta_end_dot_

 paul continues to express reservations about endorsing the mccain ticket and will likely find a great deal in common with barr _meta_end_dot_

 might paul throw his support to barr and encourage his followers to back him _meta_end_question_

 it wouldn t surprise me at all _meta_end_dot_

 the point isn t that barr is seriously going to be in a position to win a single state he clearly won t be _meta_end_dot_

 but it s hardly a stretch to think barr might be able to put a few percentage points together in some competitive states with a coalition of paulites libertarians and disaffected republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in a close contest in which a percentage point here or there might matter could barr matter _meta_end_question_

 i don t see why not _meta_end_dot_
