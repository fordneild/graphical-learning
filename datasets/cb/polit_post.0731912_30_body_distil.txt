  earlier this week dr _meta_end_dot_

 james holsinger the president s controversial surgeon general nominee resigned from the board of the asbury theological seminary in kentucky apparently because he believes he s poised to take office _meta_end_dot_

 has the senate agreed to overlook his record and confirm his nomination _meta_end_question_

 no holsinger is apparently telling people the president plans to appoint him to the post once the congress goes into recess _meta_end_dot_

 these recess appointments seem to anger senate democrats more than almost anything else _meta_end_dot_

 in april the white house drove the majority party batty with some controversial appointments and harry reid _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 quickly realized that the only way to avoid recess mischief is to eliminate recesses _meta_end_dot_

 it s exactly why a move is afoot to deny bush any opportunities in this area _meta_end_dot_

 reid and the democratic leadership have two choices in this situation _meta_end_dot_

 pro forma sessions is the superior option _meta_end_dot_

 basically a local senator probably from virginia or maryland will keep the senate technically in session by stopping by the hill banging the gavel a couple of times and going home _meta_end_dot_

 this will of course prevent the white house from acting up _meta_end_dot_

 i think every time there s a recess people are concerned that the president might use that option said sen _meta_end_dot_

 patty murray wash the democratic conference secretary _meta_end_dot_

 that s because he always does use that option _meta_end_dot_

 note to dems there are three democratic senators in virginia and maryland _meta_end_dot_

 put em to work _meta_end_dot_
