  just how silly is the silly season _meta_end_question_

 consider the story that has quickly come to dominate the political world s attention this morning and this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 drudge is running this report alongside a photo of barack obama visiting africa and wearing somali garb _meta_end_dot_

 the headline reads clinton staffers circulate dressed obama it s hard to know where to start with a story like this though i couldn t help but notice that drudge showed other pictures with his report of prominent political figures including george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and hillary clinton also wearing foreign attire while visiting overseas _meta_end_dot_

 when drudge feels compelled to add important context you know the story is weak given that the more politically salient question seems to be whether the clinton campaign would really be so desperate as to send this picture around to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 remember the right loves what are called bank shots attacking obama and trying to pin it on clinton and in the process hitting both _meta_end_dot_

 this happened of course back with the original madrassa story which the clinton campaign apparently had nothing to do with _meta_end_dot_

 drudge claims that clinton s team is circulating the pic and the obama campaign issued a statement working under the assumption that the clinton campaign is responsible on the very day that senator clinton is giving a speech about restoring respect for america in the world her campaign has engaged in the most shameful offensive fear mongering we ve seen from either party in this election _meta_end_dot_

 this is part of a disturbing pattern that led her county chairs to resign in iowa her campaign chairman to resign in new hampshire and it s exactly the kind of divisive politics that turns away americans of all parties and diminishes respect for america in the world i was skeptical about whether this was the right move it s never wise to just accept drudge reports at face value but the official clinton response was less than helpful _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the clinton campaign sent out there is alas not so much as a hint of a denial here _meta_end_dot_

 asked if the clinton campaign has been circulating the picture the clinton campaign has effectively responded there s nothing wrong with the picture of course that s not exactly an answer though in a way perhaps it is _meta_end_dot_

 i m particularly struck by we will not be distracted in general that s a good motto but in this case isn t the opposite true _meta_end_question_

 if the clinton campaign has found it necessary to disseminate a photo of obama in traditional somali clothing isn t that by definition an example of the clinton campaign being entirely distracted _meta_end_question_

 after all pushing the pic doesn t exactly come across as on message look _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s obama _meta_end_exclamation_

 in a funny outfit on the contrary it comes across as a reckless and desperate move _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule these cheap shots tend to backfire _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is that today s gambit will be no different _meta_end_dot_
