  it must be rather frustrating for the mccain campaign to have so few honest arguments to make _meta_end_dot_

 i can sympathize if i worked for mccain i m not sure what i d do to sell this clunker of a campaign to the public either _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the mccain gang s latest ad it s painfully obvious that this team has decided the only way to win is to deceive as many voters as possible _meta_end_dot_

 the voice over tells the viewer celebrity _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 obama s new taxes could break your family budget _meta_end_dot_

 the press warns the taxman cometh obama s taxes mean higher prices at the pump obama s taxes a recipe for economic disaster higher taxes _meta_end_dot_

 higher gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 economic disaster _meta_end_dot_

 that s the real obama it s a shame there are still _meta_number_ref_ days until the election i m running out of adjectives to describe the mccain s offensive dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 in this case mccain is clinging to the ol gop standard eek _meta_end_exclamation_

 the democrat wants to raise your taxes like an electoral life preserver _meta_end_dot_

 it is of course completely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 in a wall street journal piece jason furman and austan goolsbee economic policy advisors for obama wrote about obama s tax policy in some detail _meta_end_dot_

 of course mccain is desperately counting on the notion that voters are idiots and won t care about the facts _meta_end_dot_

 mccain could engage obama in an honest debate about tax policy but he can t he knows he d lose _meta_end_dot_

 so we get garbage like his latest tv ad _meta_end_dot_

 something digby recently said continues to ring true i am really starting to hate this unctuous double talking creep
