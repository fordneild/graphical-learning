  guest post by thomas mckelvey cleaver editor s note way back in november when the writer s guild strike first began carpetbagger regular thomas mckelvey cleaver was kind enough to write a guest post from an insider s perspective offering valuable insights on what the dispute is all about _meta_end_dot_

 now with the strike coming to a conclusion tom is back to explain what happened and put it in a broader context _meta_end_dot_

 cb i ve posted my immediate response to the news of the settlement of the wga strike in yesterday s end of day thread comments _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had a few more hours to think about it and i think there s more to this strike than just that we didn t get smacked around like we have for the past _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the disastrous _meta_number_ref_ strike made folks like me entirely gun shy _meta_end_dot_

 i can tell you for an absolute fact that my life would be significantly different today had that strike never happened and i had been able to do the things i was set to do at the moment that strike came along and turned my world upside down _meta_end_dot_

 and having it end in a way that made those things impossible to ever put back together demonstrating that we writers really were like humpty dumpty had its intended effect _meta_end_dot_

 like most of the rest of the membership i was happy to take the crumbs the other side offered over _meta_number_ref_ different contract negotiations in the years since _meta_end_dot_

 no strike that i wasn t happy at all _meta_end_dot_

 i was mad as hell but one thing writers in hollywood learn soon is that if you ever let the other side know how you really feel they ll go find ten people who will toe the line and you will not only be fired from what you re doing it will be a long time before you do something else and when you do it will be for less money _meta_end_dot_

 you ll never work again in this town may be thought of as a joke by people who aren t here but everyone who is here knows it is real _meta_end_dot_

 over the years when i ran across writers who would argue for a hard line with the companies i would think of them the way i did the morons dumb enough to stand up in the middle of a firefight in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 as i look at things today i think it s clear that my fellow members of the writers guild and i weren t the only union members who have thought like this over the past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 nowadays the airline unions give up pay increases and even agree to give backs only to find that the incompetent morons who put the ship onto the rocks are the ones reaping multi million dollar bonuses when the efforts of the workers results in the company coming back from the dead _meta_end_dot_

 and when those who did the heavy lifting come around and ask for their effort to be rewarded with the promised restoration of benefits and paychecks the thieves look at them like they re fools which they were to ever make the agreement in the first place as it always seems to turn out _meta_end_dot_

 grocery store unions give up their future and agree to allow new workers to be hired at lower pay rates to keep what little the original workers had and then watch while the company management makes conditions of employment so onerous that within a matter of a few years all the old employees are gone unable to stand it _meta_end_dot_

 and while that is going on the new workers the knowledge workers are getting the equivalent of a _meta_number_ref_ henry ford work contract worthwhile pay with no benefits no security no future other than that of being a permanent temp while they work at companies run by progressives who donate regularly to the hillary clinton wing of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 trust me you may think that the names yahoo and google mean having nice cafeterias serving gourmet food and other little perks but the working hours and the benefits for the permanent temps who constitute _meta_number_ref_ percent of the workforce make what old henry ford was offering a century ago look good in comparison _meta_end_dot_

 as i said yesterday i was not one of those who voted for my union s current leadership when they ran for office because they were obviously strike happy a vote for patric verrone and his list of supporters was a vote for a strike _meta_end_dot_

 and anyone who lived through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of those who did are no longer working in the field never wanted to go through that again and lose what little we had left _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but the kind of member the union s been getting over the past _meta_number_ref_ years in greater and greater numbers the ivy leaguers who live right up to my old friend david freeman s description of hollywood as the last respectable outlaw profession for upper class white boys aren t exactly the kind of people you expect to find on a picket line wielding baseball bats _meta_end_dot_

 bourgeois bolsheviks is what i ve called them _meta_end_dot_

 more than once _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that all the reasons to have a strike weren t good and solid reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the pinstriped pimps on the other side of the desk really did want to take away what little we had left and since they were intergalactic corporations for whom their hollywood studio arms were merely disposable little widget makers in the big widget factory they were likely able to get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 threats to hire non union writers were real there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people come to los angeles every year to become writers and the union takes in around _meta_number_ref_ or so in a calendar year _meta_end_dot_

 those are long odds and it s true there are those who would be happy to take a shortcut to success even if it meant stepping on others and led to a success that wasn t going to be all that successful _meta_end_dot_

 and so we went on strike _meta_end_dot_

 i was definitely a reluctant warrior _meta_end_dot_

 and then things happened that had never happened before _meta_end_dot_

 i recall about two weeks into the strike driving along ventura boulevard in encino on a very rainy morning and the traffic was godawful even more godawful than it usually is with all the over development going on there _meta_end_dot_

 i eventually got down to the site of the delay and it was a bunch of wga pickets in front of a production company _meta_end_dot_

 in the rain _meta_end_exclamation_

 without umbrellas _meta_end_exclamation_

 this from a union that called off pickets _meta_number_ref_ years ago on the threat of a _meta_number_ref_ percent chance of rain _meta_end_dot_

 and people were regularly manning picket lines outside the major studios _meta_end_dot_

 every day _meta_end_dot_

 big time name writers on the lines _meta_end_dot_

 big time name writers on the lines encouraging those who aren t and may never be big time names _meta_end_dot_

 the guys who created great shows like heroes and the shield leaving their shows and letting them die for the strike for the little guys and then there were the actors _meta_end_dot_

 everybody in hollywood s got a flaky actor story they re the union with the biggest membership and the greatest unemployment _meta_end_dot_

 the people who dislike themselves so much they want to be someone else _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i love actors _meta_end_dot_

 i am a writer who speaks the lines i ve just written aloud to be sure a human being can wrap their lips around the words as my old friend fred ward explained it to me but when you watch a scene where the words not only get said right but that talented artist brings something out of themselves to illustrate points you weren t even aware were there until they show you their presence when that scene on the page becomes three dimensional well _meta_end_dot_

 god love actors _meta_end_dot_

 and god love the screen actors guild _meta_end_dot_

 it was the actors who made sure the pimps understood that it wasn t just the writers out there _meta_end_dot_

 it was a list talent like tom hanks and george clooney and laura linney and you name them who came out and stood on the lines with the not so famous _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly it was the a listers who told hollywood they were ok with not having a fun party at the golden globes _meta_end_dot_

 that made the big folks realize this was serious that they were going to have to deal with the crazy writers if they didn t want their industry to fall apart _meta_end_dot_

 basically it came down to union brothers and sisters standing on the lines in the rain and cold ok a southern california winter at its worst isn t like chicago but the new york folks suffered and it was cold enough here a couple days i put on my long johns _meta_end_dot_

 all those upper class white boys and girls turned out to have better teamster guts than the teamsters had _meta_end_dot_

 in the end the other side really did lose _meta_end_dot_

 all their attack dogs couldn t run us off _meta_end_dot_

 ol massa had to come down off the portico and talk to the house slaves and the field slaves and recognize they were indeed human beings and they weren t going away _meta_end_dot_

 what did we get _meta_end_question_

 we got a percentage of the frickin gross _meta_end_dot_

 no more producer s net profits which eddie murphy once very rightly called monkey points no more having to sue the bastards for ten years like james garner did _meta_number_ref_ years ago to get universal to admit that the rockford files had always been profitable _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a big percentage but it s not going away _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ years from now writers using mediums for story telling we can only guess at and likely guess wrong will be getting paid as full participants in the creative process because of this strike _meta_end_dot_

 patric was right when he said yesterday that this is the most important contract the guild has signed _meta_end_dot_

 i would say it s the most important contract since the first contract in _meta_number_ref_ where we forced the pimps to recognize we existed _meta_end_dot_

 now we have not only the right to exist but the right to be paid appropriately _meta_end_dot_

 it s still going to be up to us in three years to make sure this sticks but i think it will _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is an interesting year _meta_end_dot_

 hope went out of our national life _meta_number_ref_ years ago when robert kennedy and martin luther king were assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been battered as a people to the point where a major candidate for the party that used to be the party of hope demonstrated her seriousness as a candidate by refusing to offer something as worthless as hope the other candidate came out and marched with us for a few hours _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad i voted for him but hope is battering its way back into our national life _meta_end_dot_

 all kinds of things i had given up hope of ever seeing again are showing up personally politically professionally _meta_end_dot_

 what we really won in our strike is the right to hope to believe that we can stand together and make things better _meta_end_dot_

 now let s restore it everywhere in america _meta_end_dot_
