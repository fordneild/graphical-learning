  when hillary clinton s presidential campaign disclosed on wednesday afternoon that the candidate had given herself a _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan it came as a huge surprise to the political world which had assumed clinton s coffers were full _meta_end_dot_

 when the campaign added that some senior aides would go without pay it reinforced the notion that in the wake of a split decision on super tuesday the clinton campaign was experiencing financial troubles at a very bad time _meta_end_dot_

 that was wednesday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 within about _meta_number_ref_ hours however a new narrative had emerged with its back against the wall the campaign is back on track thanks to contributors who stepped up when clinton needed them most _meta_end_dot_

 what looked like a potential disaster became an opportunity and the campaign ended up raising more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the good fortune is leading some to question whether the desperate financial straits were legitimate in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 tnr s jason zengerle suggested clinton s _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan may have been a ruse amounting to her oral roberts moment in _meta_number_ref_ the televangelist told his followers god would call him home unless they contributed _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 his followers duly chipped in and the scheme worked abc news under a headline that read cash strapped clinton campaign stunt had an item along the same lines _meta_end_dot_

 anything s possible i suppose but i seriously doubt this was an orchestrated ploy _meta_end_dot_

 second the senator really did loan her campaign _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 and her top aides really were prepared to work without compensation for a little while _meta_end_dot_

 these weren t just rumors they were actual occurrences _meta_end_dot_

 third there was simply no reason for the campaign to take this kind of risk _meta_end_dot_

 nothing feeds into the campaign on the ropes narrative like financial trouble _meta_end_dot_

 it strikes me as implausible that clinton would give herself a loan and allow her supporters to start to panic all in the hopes that it might work to her advantage _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth if it was a ruse it partially backfired the obama campaign used the clinton loan to rally its own supporters and the illinois senator raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ million the day after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s kind of fun to think every political event is orchestrated by clever tacticians who have coordinated strategies at play but sometimes things are what they appear _meta_end_dot_

 the most plausible scenario is that the clinton campaign was having serious money trouble and her donors responded _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the most entertaining explanation but it s probably the right one _meta_end_dot_
