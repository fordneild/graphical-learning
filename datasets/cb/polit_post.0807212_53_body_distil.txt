  the entire dynamic is tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 an associate of one of the democratic presidential candidates says something intemperate the other campaign is outraged and calls for resignations and dismissals fly _meta_end_dot_

 both sides insist these dust ups are character tests for the rival candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the umbrage wars as john dickerson calls them began in earnest _meta_number_ref_ months ago after david geffen insulted the clintons and it s been raging ever since _meta_end_dot_

 it s tiresome of course because in most instances the fights seem pretty irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 most americans haven t heard of the associates in question and don t much care what they said about the opposing candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the media tends to love the drama but it usually feels more like a manufactured controversy meant to give otherwise bored reporters something to do _meta_end_dot_

 but the real problem with these generally trivial flare ups is that once in a while one candidate associate says something truly offensive _meta_end_dot_

 take geraldine ferraro for example who appears to have lost her mind _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly recap ferraro the democratic vp candidate _meta_number_ref_ years ago launched a bitter attack against obama a few days ago suggesting he s fortunate to be a black man _meta_end_dot_

 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position she said _meta_end_dot_

 and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position _meta_end_dot_

 he happens to be very lucky to be who he is _meta_end_dot_

 and the country is caught up in the concept the clinton campaign responded with the single gentlest rebuke imaginable with howard wolfson saying we disagree with her when the obama campaign pressed for a more forceful response ferraro went completely over the edge _meta_end_dot_

 ferraro added every time that campaign is upset about something they call it racist _meta_end_dot_

 i will not be discriminated against because i m white it s breathtaking to see someone destroy their own reputation with such ugly nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 no one is trying to discriminate against ferraro they re simply arguing that clinton s presidential campaign which has been quick to pounce on intemperate remarks from obama associates should disassociate itself from someone making racially charged comments _meta_end_dot_

 complicating matters the clinton campaign has been a little clumsy in its response _meta_end_dot_

 first the campaign said it disagrees with ferraro _meta_end_dot_

 second the campaign said obama aides were playing the race card by criticizing ferraro which doesn t appear to make any sense at all _meta_end_dot_

 third clinton personally tried to dismiss ferraro s comments by criticizing all surrogates who push the envelope it is regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides because we ve both had that experience say things that kind of veer off into the personal clinton did not however specifically denounce or reject ferraro s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 fourth the clinton campaign finally got around to saying w e reject her remarks as for ferraro it s a genuine shame to see someone of her stature fall apart like this _meta_end_dot_

 she was a pioneer and a democratic leader and she s thrown her reputation away _meta_end_dot_

 it s painful to watch _meta_end_dot_
