  barack obama s efforts to reach out to religious voters have been well documented in recent months and there s ample evidence that the efforts are paying off _meta_end_dot_

 mark demoss recently suggested obama was positioned to win about _meta_percent_ref_ of the evangelical vote and the obama campaign has unveiled the matthew _meta_number_ref_ network a religious outreach initiative spearheaded by mara vanderslice who was director of religious outreach for the kerry edwards campaign in _meta_number_ref_ after obama met with a group of high profile ecumenical leaders in chicago two weeks ago david brody the national correspondent for pat robertson s network noted folks this is an important development _meta_end_dot_

 it shows that the game has changed _meta_end_dot_

 old rules don t apply _meta_end_dot_

 we re in uncharted territory this not surprisingly is started to generate some consternation in religious right circles _meta_end_dot_

 obama s goal is not only to gain support but also to expand the definition of what constitutes a religious issue beyond just gays and abortion to include matters like poverty the environment social justice and aids hiv _meta_end_dot_

 and so far it s a strategy that s having some success _meta_end_dot_

 focus on the family s james dobson has seen enough _meta_end_dot_

 via ron chusid that in and of itself is rather remarkable an obama aide thought it would be worthwhile for dobson to actually talk to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 there s no entirely apt comparison but it d be a bit like john mccain stopping by the offices of moveon org for a courtesy call _meta_end_dot_

 dobson apparently won t visit with obama and feels strongly enough about obama s appeal to evangelical voters to leak his anti obama diatribe to the ap in advance of his broadcast _meta_end_dot_

 first if anyone is dragging scripture through the gutter it s james dobson _meta_end_dot_

 second the fact that dobson is pushing back this aggressively only bolsters the notion that obama s efforts to rewrite the religio political rules are working _meta_end_dot_

 dobson isn t attacking from a position of outrage he s attack from a position of panic _meta_end_dot_

 and third the irony is dobson helped create this opportunity for obama in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 it was dobson after all who issued a statement in february insisting he would not vote for mccain in the general election and would stay home if mccain is the gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 this not surprisingly sent a signal to a whole lot of evangelicals that a mccain isn t a reliable ally and b maybe that nice outreach person from the obama campaign deserves a moment of their time _meta_end_dot_

 now dobson s left to scramble left with a message that effectively sounds like wait _meta_end_exclamation_

 i hate mccain but i really hate obama it may be too late jim _meta_end_dot_
