  barack obama has been the target of countless attacks from countless directions but seems to be hanging on fairly well _meta_end_dot_

 slate s jack shafer argues that obama has achieved a level of superslipperiness as something of a teflon coated candidate in hoping to explain obama s ability to shake off the attacks shafer pointed to obama s poise and discipline which allow him to resist whatever bait the press and politicians dangle in front of him perhaps but i think the broader argument is flawed for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 hadn t flip flopped on iraq guns and bush s faith based initiative _meta_end_dot_

 in other words shafer wonders why none of these stories stuck _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not that mysterious they didn t stick because there were no real stories there _meta_end_dot_

 there was nothing to stick _meta_end_dot_

 second i m not sure if shafer s premise is right either _meta_end_dot_

 nothing negative has stuck to obama _meta_end_question_

 i seem to recall a few polls showing tens of millions of americans believing that obama is a secret muslim and the percentage has gone up as more information has become available _meta_end_dot_

 indeed a newsweek from earlier this month found _meta_percent_ref_ of americans believe obama was raised a muslim and _meta_percent_ref_ believe he attended a muslim school as a child _meta_end_dot_

 neither of these claims is true but they ve stuck thanks to a concerted smear campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter obama has been generally consistent on almost everything but if a cnn poll from earlier this month is any indication the flip flopper attack was pretty successful in sticking too _meta_end_dot_

 i d be delighted if none of the attacks against obama stuck but as far as i can tell he s not that lucky _meta_end_dot_
