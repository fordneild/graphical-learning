  in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ bush pushed two massive tax cut packages through congress with near universal republican support _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it was something akin to a gop fealty test to vote for the white house tax cuts was to be a good republican _meta_end_dot_

 in the senate two gop lawmakers balked lincoln chafee who later left the party and john mccain who no longer wants to talk about his votes _meta_end_dot_

 when pressed mccain usually argues that he rejected bush s tax cuts because there were no accompanying spending cuts to prevent massive deficits _meta_end_dot_

 the defense has always been largely incoherent for at least two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain now believes tax cuts can pay for themselves aka the tax fairy theory so there was no need for spending cuts _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain at the time said quite clearly that his opposition to the cuts had nothing to do with spending and everything to do with bush s policy being excessively skewed to the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 at last night s republican debate in simi valley the lat s janet hook asked for an explanation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain responded i haven t the foggiest idea what this means _meta_end_dot_

 but he responded with a garbled and incoherent mess _meta_end_dot_

 as noam scheiber put it it was indeed _meta_end_dot_

 the point i can t get around though is that mccain had to realize a question like this was coming _meta_end_dot_

 indeed after a year of campaigning he s probably heard it before _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t a trick question either his explanations add up or they don t _meta_end_dot_

 maybe mccain s vaunted political skills have been exaggerated a bit _meta_end_question_
