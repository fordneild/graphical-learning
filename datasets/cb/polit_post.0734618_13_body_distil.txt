  yesterday the huffington post s tom edsall reported that hillary clinton s presidential campaign may be subtly quietly targeting barack obama over his teenaged drug use _meta_end_dot_

 edsall s article though felt a little thin it said the clinton campaign had sent out a cryptic email alluding to shortcomings in obama s past _meta_end_dot_

 the message from the campaign headquarters did not go into any detail _meta_end_dot_

 of course this isn t exactly rock solid _meta_end_dot_

 unnamed activists have received ambiguous messages from clinton allies about obama s drug use _meta_end_question_

 i need a little more _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign is seriously going to pursue this it would be a pretty dramatic escalation but i need something tangible _meta_end_dot_

 this qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 via greg sargent the clinton campaign really ought to be careful with this they re playing with fire _meta_end_dot_

 of course you ll notice that the attack here is indirect shaheen didn t go after obama for drug experimentation as a teenager he went after obama because he said republicans would use drug experimentation as a teenager against him _meta_end_dot_

 but this i suspect a big mistake for the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing it reeks of desperation perhaps even more so than using obama s kindergarten essays as evidence of excessive ambition _meta_end_dot_

 for another it feels like an awfully cheap shot _meta_end_dot_

 indeed shaheen implicitly told the washington post that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush handled the drug issue well by fudging the truth while obama has handled it poorly by acknowledging the truth _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule praising bush and urging a dem rival to follow his example is a bad idea in a democratic presidential primary _meta_end_dot_

 this issue has been pretty thoroughly vetted _meta_end_dot_

 obama has written about it spoken about it and answered questions about it _meta_end_dot_

 voters don t care reporters don t care even rudy giuliani hardly sympathetic to dems has said he believes the issue should be off the table _meta_end_dot_

 for the clinton campaign to push this at this late hour could backfire _meta_end_dot_
