  this was painful to listen to _meta_end_dot_

 following up on the clinton campaign s new ad the one in which the campaign claims that clinton is tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world the senator s team hosted a conference call with reporters yesterday to discuss the broader arguments _meta_end_dot_

 slate s john dickerson asked clinton aides on the call a reasonable and straightforward question what foreign policy moment would you point to in hillary s career where she s been tested by crisis regrettably the usually loquacious clinton team sat in stone silence for what seemed like quite a while i think it was literally seven or eight seconds which was quite a pregnant pause under the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 eventually mark penn piped up _meta_end_dot_

 that s not bad and clinton s remarks in china were terrific but a this doesn t really count as having been tested by crisis and b mark penn has spent the last few months insisting that giving a speech doesn t really amount to real work _meta_end_dot_

 after whiffing on the question clinton aide lee feinstein offered a response of his own _meta_end_dot_

 that too is accurate and impressive _meta_end_dot_

 but the question was about moments in which clinton has been tested by crises a claim from the campaign s hard hitting new ad _meta_end_dot_

 endorsements from military officials are important but they don t necessarily answer the question _meta_end_dot_

 asks how could they go forward with that ad without having a good answer to the question on hand it s not an unreasonable question the campaign probably should have seen this one coming _meta_end_dot_

 for his part dickerson who started all this trouble wrote about the exchange _meta_end_dot_

 of course obama didn t raise the claim but he struggles with the same question _meta_end_dot_

 sounds about right to me _meta_end_dot_
