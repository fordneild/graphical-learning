  as the presidential campaign has unfolded there have been a handful of washington post articles about democratic candidates that were so awful i felt genuinely sorry for the newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 an odd front page piece on john edwards selling his house a bizarre front page expose on hillary clinton s charitable donations and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word hit job on the controversy surrounding edwards haircut come to mind _meta_end_dot_

 but today s lengthy front page piece on rumors about barack obama s non existent muslim background may be the worst most irresponsible piece of journalism i ve seen from any respectable news outlet this year _meta_end_dot_

 i ve gone through it a couple of times and i can t quite figure out what the post s editors were thinking publishing the piece at all better yet on the front page _meta_end_dot_

 the headline gets the ball rolling foes use obama s muslim ties to fuel rumors about him as if obama has muslim ties that should be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 the story proceeds to detail public attitudes about muslims quote muslim leaders share the concerns of anti muslim activists compare muslim s public standing to mormon s etc _meta_end_dot_

 it might be a perfectly reasonable piece if obama weren t an active church going christian who has never been a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 but this front page story reads like a slam job on a right wing blog _meta_end_dot_

 it talks about rumors without noting that they re actually lies it talks about obama s denials as if the attacks might have some merit _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the article didn t even mention the substance of the senator s rejection of this nonsense until the _meta_number_ref_th paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 yes and now that one of the nation s most important newspaper have lent the nonsense credence with a front page piece the rumors i e demonstrably false smears will gain even more traction _meta_end_dot_

 in fact a piece like this instead of setting the record straight for the public s benefit does the exact opposite it suggests to voters that this is a legitimate area of inquiry _meta_end_dot_

 if someone is just hearing about these lies now and the wapo article is the first he or she has seen of this the implication is that the attack is somehow plausible _meta_end_dot_

 the article never gets around to telling the reader the truth which ostensibly is what political journalism is supposed to be all about _meta_end_dot_

 the article even brings up the madrassa garbage and notes that obama denied its accuracy _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is far more complete other news outlets investigated and found out that the story was flat wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the post didn t find that little detail worth mentioning _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall adds c mon washington post you re better than this _meta_end_dot_

 you have to be better than this _meta_end_dot_

 the public needs you to be better than this _meta_end_dot_

 update cbs news headline as of an hour ago obama dogged by muslim rumors it s almost as if the media is trying to be irresponsible _meta_end_dot_
