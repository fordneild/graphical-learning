  it s fair to say looking back that _meta_number_ref_ hasn t turned out quite the way the new democratic congressional majority had hoped _meta_end_dot_

 after an impressive surprise victory in november _meta_number_ref_ in which americans delivered both chambers to the dems the first year hasn t produced the legislative victories anyone had hoped for _meta_end_dot_

 for most political observers there s no great mystery here _meta_end_dot_

 a combination of republican obstructionism white house intransigence and all too often democratic hesitation on matters of national security have contributed to unmet expectations _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a little jarring to see the right take a victory lap _meta_end_dot_

 national review s david freddoso published a piece this week practically taunting the democratic majority for losing multiple legislative battles ok let s take these one at a time _meta_end_dot_

 mocked the minority party of moving to the left of the dems on spending _meta_end_dot_

 that makes the gop look worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ yep bush is getting his money for the war thanks in large part to congressional republicans who wouldn t allow a vote on anything but a blank check _meta_end_dot_

 this too makes the gop look worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the republican handling of the debate on the amt was absurd as was david freddoso s understanding of it _meta_end_dot_

 dems wanted to pass an amt fix that didn t raise the deficit republicans insisted that they would only allow a vote on an amt fix that did raise the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 worse the gop fought like crazy to preserve special tax breaks for hedge fund managers whose income is held to a lower bracket that everyone else s _meta_end_dot_

 this too makes the gop look worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ freddoso dismisses the energy bill as valueless but it s worth noting that the legislation raises fuel efficiency for the first time since cars had eight track players and included valuable mandates on alternative fuels _meta_end_dot_

 it would have gone further but republicans refused to allow votes on renewable electricity generation and expanded investment into conservation and development of renewable fuels _meta_end_dot_

 besides the dems bill is a hell of a lot better than the pathetic energy bill the gop passed in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this too makes the gop look worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and on s chip freddoso said the measure could have passed with some good faith negotiations he might not have been paying attention to current events this year but the s chip bill bush vetoed twice was the result of good faith negotiations the only reason congress couldn t override the veto was because of fabricated talking points run in publications like the national review _meta_end_dot_

 the result will be fewer low income kids with access to healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 this too makes the gop look worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying there haven t been setbacks and i m certainly not saying congressional dems have handled their legislative agenda as well as i had hoped but before conservatives pop the champagne bottles they may want to remember that their congressional allies haven t done the right any favors _meta_end_dot_
