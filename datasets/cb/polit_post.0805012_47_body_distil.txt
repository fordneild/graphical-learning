  guest post by dna yesterday republicans were up in arms over michelle obama s alleged proclamation that she was only proud of her country because her husband was running for president _meta_end_dot_

 this was the quote they used naturally the reaction on the right was horror horror horror that michelle could make such a narcissistic statement _meta_end_dot_

 how could she only be proud of her country now that her husband is running for president _meta_end_question_

 hot air kathryn lopez at nro victor davis hanson was also incensed that such an accomplished person wouldn t be grateful that she was allowed to get so far the tone of hanson s post is that he is almost personally offended that the obamas aren t on their knees thanking america for those ivy league degrees and upper class incomes _meta_end_dot_

 yeah because the obama s didn t earn those ivy league degrees and incomes they just got them because white folks were nice enough to share _meta_end_dot_

 shorter conservatism if you re rich it s because you ve earned it unless you re black in which case you got it because of affirmative action and maybe because white people felt sorry for you _meta_end_dot_

 unless you re clarence thomas who is the world s greatest silent jurist _meta_end_dot_

 derbyshire chimes in later attacking michelle s interests at princeton god forbid a black person be interested in their own community as opposed to say swooning over the imperialist rationalizations of rudyard kipling _meta_end_dot_

 it should come as no surprise that derbyshire who likes his black and latino women competing for the honor of cleaning his toilet bowl rather than helping their husband run for president is offended by an outspoken black woman _meta_end_dot_

 but still there s more translation don t be fooled all black people think the same even if they don t talk alike or have perms and even if they ve attended ivy league schools _meta_end_dot_

 in any case all of the above had one thing in common they had all misquoted michelle obama to make their point _meta_end_dot_

 the place where the quote originated the boston globe s political intelligence blog had posted half the quote with a snarky title in typical drudge baiting fashion _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith quoted what was posted there at politico and everything snowballed from there _meta_end_dot_

 hours later the full quote was up _meta_end_dot_

 still later there was an update acknowledging that the full quote had not been posted _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what michelle obama meant but being a black person with privilege and access often makes you more aware of american inequality not less and it wouldn t surprise me if that s what michelle was referring to _meta_end_dot_

 try living in say new orleans or newark for a few years and see how proud of your country it makes you _meta_end_dot_

 the full quote the reporter seems to have quoted michelle obama mid sentence since what was once a comma is now a period literally says she is not proud just because her husband is running for president after emailing briefly with ben smith he corrected his original item while the folks at hot air and nro didn t _meta_end_dot_

 if you have to cut a quote mid sentence to make a point you don t have a point _meta_end_dot_
