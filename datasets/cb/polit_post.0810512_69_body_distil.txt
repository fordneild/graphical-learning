  atrios raised a very good point over the weekend which captures an important aspect of the presidential campaign _meta_percent_ref_ of the time in politics all that matters who is perceived as playing offense and who is perceived as playing defense _meta_end_dot_

 the details are usually irrelevant although occasionally such things backfire _meta_end_dot_

 if you can get the press to report your team as playing offense then you re winning and the team playing defense is seen as losing quite right _meta_end_dot_

 when obama s bitter flap flared up over the weekend it was pretty obvious who was winning hillary clinton was on the offensive obama was on the defensive _meta_end_dot_

 i m also reminded of the adage if you re explaining you re losing and in this case obama was clearly desperately trying to explain with this in mind obama decided yesterday that he wants to be on the offensive too _meta_end_dot_

 noting the remarks the headline in the wall street journal read obama goes on offense after fumble i suppose that was the goal to borrow atrios observation if you can get the press to report your team as playing offense then you re winning or in obama s case at least he s making a forceful effort to stop losing _meta_end_dot_

 there s something else that stood out for me watching obama play offense yesterday he s relying a lot on humor _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it seems to be something of a trademark for him _meta_end_dot_

 in january _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate can go a long way relying on a good sense of humor _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually the best way to go on the offensive attacks can make people feel uncomfortable but if you re laughing when you re doing it the criticism is less jarring _meta_end_dot_

 indeed take a moment to contrast this with clinton s comments from saturday in which she accused obama of being an elitist out of touch with american values _meta_end_dot_

 it not only sounded like a republican making an attack against a democrat it also sounded harsh and to use the word of the week kind of bitter _meta_end_dot_

 now i realize that some of this is elevating style over substance _meta_end_dot_

 people can consider the merit of what the candidates are saying while on the offensive and decide whether the attacks have merit or not _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there was anything factually wrong with what either of them said about the other _meta_end_dot_

 but i m also reminded that voters frequently even routinely consider favorability and likability when critiquing candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the media is following who s on the offensive and who s on the defensive but the public is also paying attention to who s getting nasty and who has their audiences laughing _meta_end_dot_

 clinton actually has a great sense of humor and surprisingly good comedic timing _meta_end_dot_

 next time she goes on the offensive she might consider borrowing a page from obama s playbook in this regard _meta_end_dot_
