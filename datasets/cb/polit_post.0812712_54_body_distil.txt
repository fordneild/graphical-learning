  i m going to assume that the focus groups put oil prices at the very top of voters priority lists _meta_end_dot_

 energy policy has gone from something of an afterthought remember when iraq dominated the democratic race _meta_end_question_

 to the singular focus of the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 there is a bill pending in congress that would make oil producing and exporting cartels illegal and the obama campaign was quick to point out that clinton has not signed on as a co sponsor _meta_end_dot_

 she did however vote for a version of the legislation last year _meta_end_dot_

 all of this of course dovetails nicely on the debate over the clinton mccain proposal for a gas tax holiday over the summer _meta_end_dot_

 it shows clinton identifying a major concern on the part of voters and offering concrete ideas to address those concerns _meta_end_dot_

 but like temporarily waiving the federal gas tax there s a disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall s response sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 well that s a good question _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s pitch yesterday probably sounds pretty good she s going to get tough with those middle eastern countries that export all the oil we want and break up their monopoly _meta_end_dot_

 for low information voters this might even move a few votes in clinton s direction _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the follow up where clinton runs into trouble _meta_end_dot_

 first the u s no matter who s president simply isn t in a position to dictate that opec no longer be a cartel i m not exactly enthralled with opec either but we don t have the ability to just break up this monopoly _meta_end_dot_

 second opec s structural flaws notwithstanding the rising price of gas isn t exactly opec s fault _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias explained it s just not the case that the current price escalation is driven by opec induced supply restrictions all indications are that everyone s producing as much oil as they possibly can _meta_end_dot_

 after all with prices this high how could you afford not to pump as much oil as you could _meta_end_question_

 it s just that demand for oil is high and rising so the price goes up i would assume that clinton knows this which is why it s disappointing to hear her suggest going to go right at opec might help consumers at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 it won t _meta_end_dot_

 and third all of this gave obama yet another opportunity to characterize clinton as a candidate who ll say anything to win you say you ve been in the white house for eight years you ve had two terms as u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator and haven t said a word about opec and now suddenly you re gonna take it right to opec _meta_end_dot_

 that s not being straight with the american people we ll see soon enough just how many voters are buying into the rhetoric anyway _meta_end_dot_

 post script i d just add by the way that i find it so much more enjoyable to blog about energy policy than flag pins haircuts and cackles _meta_end_dot_

 i think clinton s wrong on this but it s not about her personality or style it s about substance _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t the campaign be fun if it were always like this _meta_end_question_
