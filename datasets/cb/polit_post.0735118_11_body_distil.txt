  for several years now white house visitor logs have been a major point of contention with the bush gang _meta_end_dot_

 about a year ago for example when dick cheney insisted that his visitor logs remain classified the wapo sued the administration for access _meta_end_dot_

 a federal judge eventually ruled that the logs were public information prompting cheney to direct the justice department to block the decision on national security grounds _meta_end_dot_

 but that s just the start of the bush gang s log problem _meta_end_dot_

 in june cheney instructed the secret service to destroy copies of visitor logs _meta_end_dot_

 a few months prior the white house told the secret service that while it maintains the visitor logs the logs don t actually belong to the secret service which means foia doesn t apply _meta_end_dot_

 today was the culmination of these arguments when a federal court ruled that visitor logs are public information _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 there s bound to be an appeal but today s decision is certainly welcome _meta_end_dot_

 and who pray tell does the white house not want us to know is stopping by _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania avenue _meta_end_question_

 in reality of course these guys have everything to hide _meta_end_dot_

 this controversy arose in earnest when the jack abramoff scandal broke and the bush gang was afraid the public would learn just how often the disgraced gop lobbyist came to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 likewise there have been plenty of questions about various conservative figures religious extremists oil company lobbyists etc _meta_end_dot_

 and the frequency with which they stopped by to see the president and his team which also prompted the need for secrecy _meta_end_dot_

 it led the bush gang to furiously come up with some kind of rationale to hide the logs _meta_end_dot_

 today s court ruling rejects this agreement stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
