  at a press conference the other day bush was asked some pointed questions about plans for his presidential library at smu do you believe it s important for the american people to know who is giving that kind of money to their president _meta_end_question_

 will you disclose the contributions as they come in _meta_end_question_

 and will you place any restriction on who gives money and how much they can give the president didn t appear to want to talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 he vowed to look at the disclosure requirements and make a decision which seemed like an odd phrase _meta_end_dot_

 when pressed on whether he d consider restrictions on who can give and whether he d take foreign money bush added yes i ll probably take some foreign money but don t know yet finally asked about the people s right to know bush hedged we re weighing taking a look taking consideration giving it a serious consideration today the wapo editorial board struck the right note suggesting disclosure is the way to go _meta_end_dot_

 we have as it turns out already heard some hints about the sources of the donations _meta_end_dot_

 faiz noted a few months ago the whole process sounds a little sketchy doesn t it _meta_end_question_
