  the good news is the house narrowly passed an iraq funding bill with some key provisions that many americans have been demanding for quite a while now including a withdrawal timeline _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is the chances of the measure becoming law are almost zero _meta_end_dot_

 while there were a handful of progressive dems who voted against the measure because it didn t go quite far enough the funding package included some worthwhile policies _meta_end_dot_

 first of course the spending bill would give the administration _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for war efforts on the condition that withdrawal begins within _meta_number_ref_ days ending in december of next year _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation also prohibited permanent u s _meta_end_dot_

 bases in iraq blocks u s _meta_end_dot_

 control of iraqi oil and limits interrogation techniques to methods authorized by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 army field manual _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly republicans aren t fond of the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 senate republicans will predictably require a _meta_number_ref_ vote majority a hurdle dems can t clear and the white house has vowed a veto _meta_end_dot_

 the amusing angle however is hearing the way the bush gang dismisses the majority _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s briefing asked which radical groups are being appeased perino explained i am talking about moveon org and code pink in particular this is all rather silly _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing moveon and code pink aren t particularly pleased with congressional democrats so it s hard to characterize them as calling the shots on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly though the white house may or may not be aware of it but the majority of the country approves of the approach dems embraced yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the president s press secretary in other words effectively called the majority of americans radical the development to watch at this point is whether senate dems push senate republicans to literally filibuster the spending bill _meta_end_dot_

 the leadership is apparently considering it and it would at a minimum push the debate to a new level _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
