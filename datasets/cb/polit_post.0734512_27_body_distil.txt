  the evidence has been overwhelming for quite a while that when it comes to climate change science the bush administration prefers restrictions to revelations _meta_end_dot_

 just two months ago for example dr _meta_end_dot_

 julie gerberding director of the centers for disease control and prevention was set to testify on the impact of climate change on public health but the white house intervened eviscerated her testimony and directed gerberding to discuss the public health benefits of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed to be part of a trend the bush gang has asked an oil lobbyist to re write government reports on global warming and muzzled nasa and noaa officials when their reports were politically inconvenient _meta_end_dot_

 of course it looked like part of a trend because it was part of a trend _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ page report is depressing but illuminating _meta_end_dot_

 bush administration officials have not only stifled dissent they ve manipulated scientific reports and censored scientists on a grand scale _meta_end_dot_

 there are so many striking examples it s hard to know where to start but a couple of gems stand out _meta_end_dot_

 this drove the point home nicely as well a reporter raised the subject yesterday with white house press secretary dana perino who dismissed the report out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 first the report from the house oversight and government reform committee is thorough and well documented _meta_end_dot_

 having perino just reject it as if the force of her denial is evidence enough is pretty ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 second does perino really want to emphasize that she s worked on these issues for a long time _meta_end_question_

 after al perino is surprisingly clueless about climate change and has embarrassed herself on the subject on more than one occasion _meta_end_dot_

 perino s nonsense notwithstanding the committee s report is an important one _meta_end_dot_

 there s never been a more important time for the public to have complete and accurate information about a pressing environmental catastrophe and there s never been a white house this aggressive in waging a war on science _meta_end_dot_
