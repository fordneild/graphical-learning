  john mccain recently acknowledged the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should he added however i ve got greenspan s book i m quite certain the maestro isn t helping _meta_end_dot_

 in south carolina mccain told an audience a couple of days ago every time in history we have raised taxes it has cut revenues as a matter of reality mccain was talking gibberish _meta_end_dot_

 a few days prior at a republican debate mccain said i don t believe we re headed into a recession _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the fundamentals of this economy are strong and i believe they will remain strong now mccain who presumably would have learned something about economics after serving in congress for the last quarter century blamed government spending for creating an economic decline that he didn t believe existed less than a week ago _meta_end_dot_

 what on earth is this guy talking about _meta_end_question_

 second how is it exactly that government spending had anything to do with today s deteriorating economic climate _meta_end_question_

 third hasn t government spending historically promoted economic growth _meta_end_question_

 fourth would a mccain administration try to improve the economy by reducing spending _meta_end_question_

 if so how much _meta_end_question_

 and where would these cuts come from _meta_end_question_

 and finally given that mccain fully admits that the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should maybe he should stop talking about it _meta_end_question_
