  it was supposed to be the bridge that no republican presidential hopeful crossed attacking mormon beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 candidates are certainly free to go after one another on their beliefs record and agenda but going after the religious tenets of a rival s faith tradition is too low a blow even by the gop s standards _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mike huckabee apparently went there anyway _meta_end_dot_

 except that is to suggest that mormons believe that jesus and the devil are brothers _meta_end_dot_

 other than that huckabee isn t interested in evaluating other people s doctrines and faiths _meta_end_dot_

 now i m not an expert in lds tenets but by all indications huckabee is theologically wrong in even asking the question but given the political climate that s hardly the most striking thing about the development _meta_end_dot_

 raised a perfectly legitimate point romney was less direct on the today show this morning _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose we ll find out if that s true _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule candidates who take cheap shots like this at rivals from their own party end up hurting themselves more than their opponent _meta_end_dot_

 but this one s tricky far too much of the republican base really doesn t like mormons and it s possible that gop activists won t care that huckabee is hitting below the belt when denigrating a faith tradition they already find offensive _meta_end_dot_

 attacking romney s church in other words may not bother right wing primary voters in the slightest _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth a huckabee spokesperson said the former governor s comments were taken out of context unless huckabee prefaced his satan question by saying the kind of question i would never ask is it s hard to see how the context could make this any better _meta_end_dot_

 as for the broader picture the incident is a reminder of huckabee s inexperience and lack of preparation for the big time _meta_end_dot_

 unless he meant to take a shot at mormon theology which i suppose is possible huckabee wouldn t have even asked a question like this if he were a competent disciplined candidate _meta_end_dot_
