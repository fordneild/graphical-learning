  for the second consecutive month more u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops were killed in afghanistan than in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 nearly seven years after the war in afghanistan began june was the deadliest month for u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and our force levels in the country are now at their highest since the war began _meta_end_dot_

 all of this tragically comes a few years after the president assured americans that the taliban no longer is in existence with conditions worsening the white house now believes it s time to send more u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops into afghanistan before the end of the year _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to increase troops by _meta_number_ref_ bush said without elaboration _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens that might be easier said than done _meta_end_dot_

 adm _meta_end_dot_

 michael mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said he doesn t have the troops for afghanistan until he can pull them out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have troops i can reach for brigades i can reach to send into afghanistan until i have a reduced requirement in iraq mullen told reporters at a press briefing _meta_end_dot_

 of course critics of administration s foreign policy have argued for years that the war in iraq necessarily diverted personal and resources from afghanistan and those concerns certainly seem to have been bolstered by mullen s remarks yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it creates a very awkward dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 the president is announcing his intention to send additional troops and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is announcing on the same day that the president s plan isn t really an option right now _meta_end_dot_

 front page piece on this did a nice job of explaining just how difficult this is _meta_end_dot_

 like tim f _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but wonder about the conservatives who ve been willing to quixotically fight against the evidence that the iraq war made it harder to win in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 let s see whether we have any of those guys still around today i m sure they ll think of something they always do but i doubt it ll make any sense _meta_end_dot_
