  long time readers may recall that i wrote a washington monthly piece two years ago about the apparent double standard the media applies to politicians marital difficulties _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton s personal difficulties dominated the media landscape for more than a decade indeed in some instances his alleged proclivities are still of interest _meta_number_ref_ years after reporters first started caring about this but republican presidential candidates related problems were seemingly off limits _meta_end_dot_

 for those who remember the _meta_number_ref_ race character issues was the euphemism to attack clinton for having a troubled personal life _meta_end_dot_

 has the phrase been applied to republican candidates with similar experiences _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 i predicted in my monthly piece that this wouldn t last and republicans with marital difficulties in their past could expect plenty of uncomfortable questions _meta_end_dot_

 this hasn t quite worked out as i d expected and reporters have shown no interest whatsoever in asking character questions about republicans _meta_end_dot_

 there have however been a few cracks in the ice _meta_end_dot_

 there was for example this report in the uk s daily mail last month about john mccain s first wife _meta_end_dot_

 it was quite a painful story involving physical difficulties infidelity and divorce _meta_end_dot_

 my marriage ended because john mccain didn t want to be _meta_number_ref_ he wanted to be _meta_number_ref_ carol mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 the first substantive report about this in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 media appeared this morning in the la times _meta_end_dot_

 yes mccain committed adultery and then was far from truthful about it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain not surprisingly doesn t want to talk about the subject _meta_end_dot_

 asked for comment his campaign spokesperson said of course we will not comment on the breakup of the senator s first marriage other than to note that the senator has always taken responsibility for it to reiterate a point i ve raised before as far as i m concerned mccain s marital difficulties and adultery aren t particularly significant in this campaign especially years later _meta_end_dot_

 i m inclined to see a distinction made between public and private worlds _meta_end_dot_

 i defended bill clinton and said his personal controversies had no bearing on his ability to be a good candidate and a good president so i can t very well turn around and say the opposite about mccain no matter how badly he treated his first wife _meta_end_dot_

 but that nevertheless leads to two relevant angles here _meta_end_dot_

 first is the partisan double standard _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton s personal history was a matter of tremendous national significance as a presidential candidate and as a president then it s not unreasonable to wonder why mccain isn t subjected to the same scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 i d prefer both issues are off the table but i m hard pressed to imagine why only democratic presidential candidates personal lives are of interest in the context of a national campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ long before the election then gov _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s personal life dominated the political discourse and journalists weren t the least bit embarrassed about making this a critical campaign issue _meta_end_dot_

 and yet today s lat piece is as far as i can tell the first u s _meta_end_dot_

 newspaper to highlight mccain s background as an adulterer _meta_end_dot_

 second even for those who are willing to say that mccain s personal family difficulties are a private matter there s also the fact that mccain apparently lied about his infidelity _meta_end_dot_

 now i understand why he lied he s no doubt embarrassed _meta_end_dot_

 but again if clinton s lies about adultery were evidence of a poor character mccain s obvious untruths warrant similar scrutiny don t they _meta_end_question_
