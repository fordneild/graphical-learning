  guest post by morbo you might have noticed that alan keyes did not win the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 i was pretty surprised _meta_end_dot_

 after all in late december i received a special message from keyes himself assuring me that his campaign was on fire _meta_end_dot_

 it looked like a lock _meta_end_dot_

 why i am i getting messages from alan keyes _meta_end_question_

 i ve mentioned before that i signed up with some kook right organizations just to see their e mail alerts _meta_end_dot_

 even though these groups always promise they won t provide your info to anyone else they lie and do just that _meta_end_dot_

 one of them gave my address to the keyes campaign and now i m getting messages from that nut _meta_end_dot_

 i m not complaining _meta_end_dot_

 they are entertaining messages that enable me to take a rare peek into the mind of a seriously disturbed individual and the few deluded souls who follow him _meta_end_dot_

 a recent fund raising appeal carried the subject line alan keyes breaks out in national polls inside it read i thought to myself that s odd _meta_end_dot_

 i don t recall any stories showing alan keyes breaking out of anything except perhaps a mental institution the message was dated dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i looked up the poll _meta_end_dot_

 what keyes never mentions in the letter is that in the poll he is at _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 real walking around people keyes support appears to be limited to his wife perhaps and some unfortunate individuals who coo over him online and who were probably dropped on their heads a lot as children _meta_end_dot_

 so at this point if i were alan keyes i doubt i d spend much time comparing myself to ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve mentioned before running for public office appears to be keyes job _meta_end_dot_

 this is his third run for president and he s also run for u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate in maryland and illinois _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what he does in off years probably goes to kook right meetings giving speeches in that annoying voice of his _meta_end_dot_

 this political blogger whom i admit i know nothing about ranks keyes dead last in the national gop race _meta_end_dot_

 he writes keyes did well in the values voters debate but destroyed any chance of having any type of voice in any type of debate after the last iowa debate _meta_end_dot_

 keyes career is over i m afraid i must disagree _meta_end_dot_

 first of all keyes career can t be over since he does not actually have one _meta_end_dot_

 and secondly his implosion happened long before that debate _meta_end_dot_

 the man long ago ceased to be entertaining _meta_end_dot_

 it was fun for a time alan but now it s just tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 say goodnight _meta_end_dot_
