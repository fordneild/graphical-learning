  putting aside at least for now genuine concerns about the structural flaws in the iowa caucus process and sidestepping analysis of specific candidates yesterday was clearly a big win for democrats in general _meta_end_dot_

 for example consider this take from fred barnes an unapologetic water carrier for republicans in the always conservative weekly standard it sure does _meta_end_dot_

 in fact dems and republicans entered the caucuses in similar positions wide open competitive contests with large fields of credible candidates no incumbent and no frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter iowa backed bush three years ago one of only two states in the country the republicans turned from blue to red between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 given this there s no obvious reason democratic turnout should have been higher than republican turnout _meta_end_dot_

 and yet it wasn t even close projections showed a turnout of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for democrats compared to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who participated in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 most projections had estimated turnout would be about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 turnout was also up on the republican side where projections showed about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people taking part actually the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ figure was a little low and came early _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt reported this morning that more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iowa dems turned out to caucus nearly double _meta_number_ref_ totals and _meta_number_ref_ wasn t bad _meta_end_dot_

 how one sided were the results _meta_end_question_

 mike huckabee cruised to an easy victory on the republican side but his vote totals would have given him a fourth place finish against the dems _meta_end_dot_

 described a common scene _meta_end_dot_

 not bad for a red state _meta_end_dot_
