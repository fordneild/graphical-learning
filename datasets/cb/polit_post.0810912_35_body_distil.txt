 vagins aclu policy counsel for civil rights and civil liberties editor s note there were quite a few troubling supreme court rulings last year but one of the more striking decisions was in ledbetter v _meta_end_dot_

 goodyear in which the court ruled _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ that workers who face wage discrimination only have _meta_number_ref_ days to challenge the initial discrimination in court _meta_end_dot_

 a legislative remedy is under consideration in the senate right now and my friends at the aclu are trying to help generate attention for the pending legislation _meta_end_dot_

 cb do you know exactly how much your co workers make _meta_end_question_

 if you got a raise recently do you know how it compares to your colleagues _meta_end_question_

 the supreme court believes you do _meta_end_dot_

 but if your employer is unfairly paying your co workers more and you don t find out soon enough you may be deprived of wages to which you are entitled for the rest of your time at that job _meta_end_dot_

 sound unfair _meta_end_question_

 it is _meta_end_dot_

 but the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate may be able to do something about it next week _meta_end_dot_

 last may the supreme court ruled in ledbetter v _meta_end_dot_

 goodyear that employees who have suffered years of discrimination can t have their day in court if they don t discover the discrimination within _meta_number_ref_ days of their employer s initial discriminatory pay decision _meta_end_dot_

 the ledbetter decision not only reversed years of employment law it also ignored the realities of a workplace _meta_end_dot_

 often employees don t know what their co workers are paid _meta_end_dot_

 in fact only one in ten private sector employers has adopted a pay openness policy and companies often prohibit employees from sharing wage information at all _meta_end_dot_

 an expectation that an employee learn that information within the first _meta_number_ref_ days of a pay decision is unreasonable _meta_end_dot_

 unless congress intervenes companies will be able to discriminate for years and unjustly profit from paying women minorities the elderly and people with disabilities less as long as it keeps the discrimination secret for a few months _meta_end_dot_

 last july the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house of representatives passed h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the lilly ledbetter fair pay act to correct this problem and to ensure employers do not profit from years of discrimination based on race color religion sex national origin age and disability simply because their employees were unaware of the discrimination for _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 the bill clarifies this wage discrimination is not a one time occurrence but rather that each discriminatory paycheck an employer issues represents an ongoing violation of the law _meta_end_dot_

 in order to expedite the legislative process the senate is now poised to take up the same house bill and vote on it as soon as this wednesday april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the time has come for the senate to correct this wrong and let american workers keep their hard earned dollars _meta_end_dot_

 in this time of economic belt tightening we need the senate and the president to help our nation s employees keep their rightful wages _meta_end_dot_
