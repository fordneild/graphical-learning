  for quite a while many of us have wondered whether republican officials in washington have any apparent talents at all _meta_end_dot_

 governing is clearly not their strong suit but are they completely without skills _meta_end_question_

 absolutely not _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ member senate republican minority has done something no senate minority in american history has ever done they ve filibustered more bills than any congress ever has and they broke the record with a full year to spare _meta_end_dot_

 the latest came this morning when the senate gop filibustered an omnibus budget bill the _meta_number_ref_nd republican filibuster since the _meta_number_ref_th congress began in january _meta_end_dot_

 brian young noting the historic quality of the achievement added only a group with a near pathological disregard for the actual health of our democracy only a group with a single minded focus on the cynical political strategies of their consultants only a group with an imperious disdain for the people of the country could ve pulled off such a feat quite right _meta_end_dot_

 this was a record that wasn t meant to be broken _meta_end_dot_

 the roadblock republican label is not meant as a compliment _meta_end_dot_

 bill scher reminds us that it may be working for the gop but it s failing for everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 if congress approval rating is any indication the answer is no _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the speed with which the republicans broke the record that really amazes me _meta_end_dot_

 the previous record took two years to accomplish these guys broke the record in half the time _meta_end_dot_

 that s like breaking the single season home run record before the all star break _meta_end_dot_

 and by the way just for good measure let s answer the trivia question _meta_end_dot_

 when was the previous record set _meta_end_question_

 that would be the _meta_number_ref_th congress the last time republicans were in the minority _meta_end_dot_

 it took a while but we ve finally found what the minority party is good at _meta_end_dot_

 congratulations republicans for undermining the legislative process the will of the people and a much needed policy agenda to a literally historic degree _meta_end_dot_
