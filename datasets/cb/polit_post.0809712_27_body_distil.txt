  the ap had an item the other day noting that john mccain is walking a fine line between running on bush s ideas and keeping some distance from a wildly unpopular president _meta_end_dot_

 the senator told abc news on monday the point is i m not running on the bush presidency i m running on my own service to the country my own record in the house of representatives and the united states senate and my vision for the future mccain sometimes makes it easy though to connect him to the president with a _meta_percent_ref_ approval rating _meta_end_dot_

 no one has supported president bush on iraq more than i have be prepared to hear that quote quite a bit in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i d argue that it s nearly as damaging as his stated willingness to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 this exchange from last august during a cnn interview _meta_end_dot_

 so in august mccain found it entertaining to hear that he s been a huge supporter of bush s iraq strategy _meta_end_dot_

 in april no one has supported president bush on iraq more than mccain has _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_dot_

 what s more yglesias added an interesting observation in some ways on iraq mccain has been worse than bush _meta_end_dot_
