  some very strange conservative activists apparently with far too much time on their hands launched an initiative last november to limit u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops access to adult materials _meta_end_dot_

 it never occurred to me that policy makers would take this seriously but apparently they are _meta_end_dot_

 to quickly recap for those just joining us congress banned sales of sexually explicit materials on military bases _meta_number_ref_ years ago but the pentagon continues to allow base stores to sell magazines such as playboy and penthouse which officials don t consider explicit enough to prohibit _meta_end_dot_

 the american family association and the alliance defense fund two religious right groups demanded the congress and defense secretary robert gates takes steps to scrutinize materials including magazines and films sold to the troops and their families _meta_end_dot_

 defense officials don t want to take porn away from soldiers adf attorney patrick trueman said _meta_end_dot_

 they say well _meta_percent_ref_ of this magazine is sexually explicit pictures but _meta_percent_ref_ is writing or advertising so the totality is not sexually explicit that s ridiculous oddly enough the activists actually found a far right member of congress to take their demands seriously _meta_end_dot_

 upon unveiling his bill broun a retired marine said allowing the sale of pornography on military bases has harmed military men and women by escalating the number of violent sexual crimes feeding a base addiction eroding the family as the primary building block of society and denigrating the moral standing of our troops both here and abroad the right is apparently lining up behind broun s bill _meta_end_dot_

 took up the cause yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 let me get this straight _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops are fighting two wars neither of which are going well and republicans believe we should spend time and energy considering what kind of magazines u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops can purchase on base _meta_end_question_

 here s a radical idea maybe those who wear the uniform and put their lives on the line for their country should be able to read whatever they want _meta_end_dot_
