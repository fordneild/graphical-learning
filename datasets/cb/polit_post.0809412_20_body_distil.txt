  we ve seen more than a few instances of late in which john mccain has made comments about foreign policy that didn t make any sense only to have joe lieberman intervene whisper in his ear and walk the republican presidential candidate back a bit _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to get the sense that while mccain is confused about current events lieberman is at least vaguely aware of reality _meta_end_dot_

 his judgment is clearly wrong but there s still some attachment to reality _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe this assumption is off base too _meta_end_dot_

 consider lieberman s criticisms of barack obama on where else fox news yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 jane hamsher has the video it s hard not to chuckle a bit hearing lieberman criticize barack obama s credibility on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 not only was obama right about the war but nearly everything lieberman said after the criticism was utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 simply mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 second his argument that the surge has worked is transparently silly _meta_end_dot_

 but the real gem here is lieberman s argument that if we had left iraq a year ago al qaeda in iran would be in control of iraq today i realize the senate s three stooges mccain lieberman and graham have been embarrassingly confused about the basics in the middle east lately but i d hoped that lieberman would be aware of the fact that there s no such thing as al qaeda in iran iran is shiite al qaeda is sunni _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman creating a new terrorist group while attacking the credibility of a colleague who s been right all along isn t exactly reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that lieberman knows this and simply misspoke _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he meant to say al qaeda in iraq and it came out al qaeda in iran during a television interview it s easy to make a mistake like this _meta_end_dot_

 but even if we give lieberman the benefit of the doubt his comments to fox news are still nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 there s simply no way aqi could take control of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it is after all a small fragmented clandestine non iraqi terrorist organization which most iraqis have already turned against _meta_end_dot_

 as joe klein recently responded after mccain made an identical claim the reality is aqi has no real allies in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the kurds have no use for them the shiite majority has no use for murderous sunni jihadists running around their country and sunnis have been rising up against aqi since before the surge even began _meta_end_dot_

 if we left al qaeda would take iraq _meta_end_question_

 not in this reality it won t _meta_end_dot_

 so either lieberman was creating a new terrorist group that doesn t exist or he doesn t understand the basics of what s going in iraq after more than five years of war _meta_end_dot_

 sure joe remind us again about how those who got the war right from the start don t come to this debate with a lot of credibility
