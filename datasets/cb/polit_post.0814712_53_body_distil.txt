  there s obviously been considerable discussion of late about hillary clinton s reference on friday to bobby kennedy s assassination in june _meta_number_ref_ with some suggesting that clinton is continuing to campaign just in case tragedy strikes _meta_end_dot_

 i for what it s worth don t buy into this interpretation but yesterday when scrutinizing the controversy fox news aired the kind of analysis that no responsible news outlet should tolerate _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch clips online fox news contributor liz trotta was talking about clinton s kennedy comment and said and now we have what some are reading as a suggestion that somebody knock off osama uh obama _meta_end_dot_

 well both if we could in other words trotta first mixes up osama bin laden and barack obama and then casually suggests both should be killed _meta_end_dot_

 she of course found her own quip hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 in what twisted political world is this considered acceptable _meta_end_question_

 considers possible repercussions _meta_end_dot_

 and at dailykos lauren s adds sure she s not the first to call obama osama but i m guessing she s the first on a national cable news network to openly state that it d be great if both osama and obama could both be killed lauren also posted the fox news segment with more context but it doesn t change the substance of what trotta said _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind trotta is not just some random crazy person brought into the studio off the street trotta is under contract as a fox news contributor _meta_end_dot_

 it s always hard to know what to expect from such a ridiculous network with no professional standards but fox news really can t keep trotta on its roster after this one _meta_end_dot_

 update several readers have asked about the specific time of the proadcast for fec purposes _meta_end_dot_

 the comment came between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am yesterday morning eastern _meta_end_dot_
