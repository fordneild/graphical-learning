  after the iowa caucuses in early january we saw tallied results that showed barack obama picking up _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that number though was actually a projection of expected results when the iowa democratic party met for its state convention _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out obama ended up doing even better _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth noting that there appears to be some disagreement about just how many new delegates obama picked up last night _meta_end_dot_

 the ap says it s nine nbc says it s five and i ve seen some reports indicating that it s seven _meta_end_dot_

 regardless whatever the number it helps obama pad his already sizable lead among pledged delegates and offers a round of helpful news _meta_end_dot_

 as ben smith noted it s a welcome and meaningful gain for obama on a tough weekend and a result both of his long hard work in iowa and of a situation in which clinton s attacks seem to be turning off party activists second the ap article on this included one phrase that stood out _meta_end_dot_

 this is the first time i ve seen a neutral news report use the automatic delegate phrase instead of the universally accepted superdelegate the clinton campaign began recommending automatic delegates about a month ago believing the subtle shift would help soften the blow if party insiders ended up overriding the pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the push didn t seem to go anywhere the campaign was gently mocked for trying to change the wording in the middle of the campaign and the talk seemed to disappear _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the ap without explanation dropped superdelegate which everyone now recognizes and understands in favor of automatic delegate which no one recognizes or understands _meta_end_dot_

 it s a little jarring _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure there are far more offensive media errors playing out during this campaign but as josh marshall noted i think it s a good journalistic principle not to switch terminology in the midst of an election campaign or public policy debate at the bidding of one party or another unless someone makes an extremely good case that the existing word choices are patently misleading _meta_end_dot_

 and doing it at the behest of one party to the dispute is almost always bad practice _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise the journalists whose job it is to sift through the spin become its messengers wittingly or not
