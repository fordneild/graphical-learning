  shortly before the republican south carolina primary in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush got into a rather heated exchange at a debate over abortion and the gop platform _meta_end_dot_

 mccain caught bush in an uncomfortable contradiction the then texas governor opposed abortion rights supported an exception for rape incest and a woman s health but embraced a republican platform that made no exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain hammered bush for running on a platform he didn t agree with _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain seems to have found himself in the exact same predicament _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as last year mccain reiterated his long held position that the republican platform should be altered to make exceptions to a national ban on abortion _meta_end_dot_

 this year under pressure from far right activists mccain is prepared to give up on his commitment _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he s doing exactly what he excoriated bush for doing eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 mccain agrees _meta_end_dot_

 or at a minimum he used to before the religious right told him he to change his mind and do exactly what he criticized bush for doing _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 sam brownback r kan defended mccain saying i don t know how you can accuse john mccain of being a flip flop on a topic where the party rank and file that will be at the convention will support that plank even if his views differ slightly that doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 in fact this isn t complicated mccain said he wanted to change the gop platform to make it more humane and now mccain has said he doesn t want to make the change _meta_end_dot_

 if you take a position and then take the opposite position for political convenience and expediency it s a flip flop _meta_end_dot_

 jennifer blei stockman added many people think of mccain as a moderate _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes out that he doesn t want to change this extreme right wing republican platform the word moderate is going to disappear from any description of mccain well at least it should _meta_end_dot_
