  following up on the last item the clinton campaign has a variety of reasons for hanging around and keeping the democratic race going some more compelling than others _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime though the campaign s worst arguments do little to build up goodwill within the party _meta_end_dot_

 it s true he really did on fox news no less there s just no reason for this _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates are generally going to be sophisticated enough to dismiss this as nonsense and rank and file dems in the three remaining primaries puerto rico montana and south dakota are unlikely to be moved by the arguments _meta_end_dot_

 all mcauliffe is doing with efforts like these is undermining the campaign s credibility and tarnishing its name _meta_end_dot_

 the focus it seems to me should be on going out on a high note and mcauliffe is making that harder not easier _meta_end_dot_

 i don t however have the foggiest idea why this matters _meta_end_dot_

 why are these five contests more significant than the _meta_number_ref_ or so primaries and caucuses before march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 for that matter this newly discovered metric appears to exclude superdelegates from the equation altogether many of whom have moved to obama in recent weeks on the second new goalpost history is a funny thing _meta_end_dot_

 there are more americans than ever before and this is the longest primary fight which means more voters have participated _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t much matter fdr got _meta_number_ref_ million votes in _meta_number_ref_ while george mcgovern got _meta_number_ref_ million in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 does this make mcgovern s performance impressive _meta_end_question_

 even the effort to count popular votes in this primary is a fool s errand _meta_end_dot_

 as josh noted i don t mention this to pile on but rather because it seems mcauliffe s argument is so counterproductive _meta_end_dot_

 atrios noted i t isn t trivial and it s destroying the respect i once had for a group of people _meta_end_dot_

 it s weird really having in some sense started my political life defending the clintons and now being rather fed up with them _meta_end_dot_

 i m not important but i m not alone it s more than just foolish rhetoric from an overeager campaign cheerleader _meta_end_dot_

 as scott lemieux noted arguments like mcauliffe s undermine the legitimacy of the democratic nominee my sense is this will all be over soon and the antics of various campaign spokespersons will probably be forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 but i also get the sense that mcauliffe s efforts among others will leave many with an unpleasant taste in their mouths _meta_end_dot_

 when people look back on the clinton campaign once the dust has settled i suspect they ll have wanted to do more to enhance the senator s reputation and stature and mcauliffe is doing the opposite _meta_end_dot_
