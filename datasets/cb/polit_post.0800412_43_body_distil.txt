  at the outset let me concede that all the usual caveats still apply _meta_end_dot_

 iowa is just one state last night was just one contest there s a lot of campaigning left to do the pressure and scrutiny from here on out is going to be extremely intense and the rest of the strong democratic field isn t about to give up without a fight _meta_end_dot_

 having said all that i think barack obama s eight point victory is every bit as remarkable as it seems if not more so _meta_end_dot_

 this just wasn t an ordinary caucus victory it was history _meta_end_dot_

 a young african american first term senator from a big city went to iowa an overwhelmingly white rural state with a large elderly population trailed most of the year and delivered a bigger win than anyone expected _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign relied on tried and true methods including a sophisticated gotv operation but more importantly it took a gamble counting on independents students and other young people to do what they usually don t participate in the caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 confounding the experts obama s strategy worked like a charm _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say obama won thanks to non traditional support _meta_end_dot_

 he won among dems independents and republicans crossing over to participate in the democratic caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 obama led in every income group and even won the woman vote despite facing the most credible woman presidential candidate in american history _meta_end_dot_

 and he did so with the kind of passion candidates dream of _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ support for john kerry in iowa seemed to a certain extent calculated dems were voting with their heads concluding that a tough smart experienced war hero rather than an upstart vermonter could carry the day _meta_end_dot_

 kerry didn t necessarily inspire the party but he was the rational logical choice _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ obama won the caucuses in an entirely different way _meta_end_dot_

 as jonathan cohn noted he won this race not because the caucus goers found him the least objectionable alternative but because they found him the most appealing _meta_end_dot_

 they liked his speeches _meta_end_dot_

 they liked his ideas _meta_end_dot_

 they liked him david brooks column today actually rings true at least so far as his obama commentary is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth noting that all of the criticisms of the iowa caucus process still apply _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case the system s flaws do not belie obama s success in large part because of the way he won in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if and that s not a tiny if obama can duplicate this elsewhere it s not unreasonable for his supporters to use this as compelling evidence of a winning general election strategy _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias added i t s a reminder that tonight s victory for organizing and mobilization was spearheaded by a former community organizer he s a guy who believes in the power of mobilizing new people and brining new people into the process _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa it s worked very well for him and it s pretty thrilling to think about what could be accomplished with that kind of energy nationwide kevin argued yesterday morning that iowa may ultimately not be quite as important as everyone thinks _meta_end_dot_

 partly this is because the race on the democratic side looks pretty close and a close race is unlikely to provide significant momentum for anyone if the caucuses had turned out _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ i think this would be largely right _meta_end_dot_

 but an eight point win i suspect can generate the kind of momentum that gives obama an edge in new hampshire where the polls show clinton and obama practically tied and in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 and if obama goes three for three he s going to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 given this last night felt less like a victory and more like a breakthrough _meta_end_dot_
