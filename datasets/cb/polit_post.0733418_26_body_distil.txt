  if a democrat asks a question at a debate for republican presidential candidates far right activists reflexively and incoherently define this as a planted question _meta_end_dot_

 but of course given the meaning of the word that doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 to really appreciate what a plant looks like you ll have to turn to the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 for example once the bush gang s initial rationale for the war in iraq was exposed as a fraud then national security adviser condoleezza rice launched a public relations campaign to shield herself from the fiasco rice frequently went on national television to tout the notion that we can t wait to be sure iraq is a threat because we don t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud _meta_end_dot_

 according to the wapo s glenn kessler rice s strategy included ordering an aide to plant a question about her possible presidential ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 that s a planted question _meta_end_dot_

 receiving a promotion _meta_end_dot_

 as unpredictable as the bush gang can be the one thing we can count on is that those who are caught making a mistake will without a doubt get promoted _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger the screw up the bigger the promotion _meta_end_dot_
