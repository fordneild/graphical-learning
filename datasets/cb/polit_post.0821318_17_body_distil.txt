  barack obama brought up john mccain s instantly infamous campaign commercial featuring britney spears and paris hilton today asking mccain i s that the best you can come up with _meta_end_question_

 is that really what this election is about _meta_end_question_

 is that what is worthy of the american people as it turns out mccain was asked about the same ad today at an event in racine wis _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of reporters are seizing on the fact that mccain is proud of his ridiculous commercial which is clearly odd _meta_end_dot_

 but i was also struck by his insistence that what we are talking about here is substance and not style i didn t see mccain s facial expression but i can t help but wonder if and how he kept a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 substance and not style _meta_end_question_

 has there been anything of any substance at all from the mccain campaign in months _meta_end_question_

 i suppose there was at least some policy talk recently when mccain commented on his tax proposals his position on affirmative action his position on gay adoption and his ideas for social security but this substance didn t last long because mccain s campaign in each instance said he didn t really mean what he was saying _meta_end_dot_

 raises a point i ve been meaning to mention _meta_end_dot_

 indeed john weaver mccain s long time friend and confidant made a similar observation yesterday saying john s been a celebrity ever since he was shot down i suppose it s possible the mccain gang means that obama is a celebrity in more of hollywood fashion _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t quite work either _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at mccain s imdb page and tell me he doesn t qualify as a celebrity there s the guest role in wedding crashers there s the film adaptation of his military career there s the appearance on _meta_number_ref_ etc _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way do you know who s made more appearances on the daily show than anyone in any field _meta_end_question_

 john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 well perhaps the mccain gang doesn t mean celebrity in a hollywood sense but more in the sense that people around the world admire barack obama and are captivated by his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 and if that s what the mccain campaign means they re going to have to do more to explain why that s a bad quality for an american president to have _meta_end_dot_
