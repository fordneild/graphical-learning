  there were plenty of political obituaries written for john mccain eight months ago when his campaign was struggling to make payroll the senator s top aides quit and he could no longer afford a campaign bus which all looks rather amusing in hindsight given that he s now the clear frontrunner for the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so how d he turn this around _meta_end_question_

 ross douthat makes the case that mccain got really lucky _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds about right but i d add just one more thing _meta_end_dot_

 consider the national polls just as a gauge _meta_end_dot_

 by the early summer when the conventional wisdom insisted that mccain stood no chance he was running second behind a guy whose campaign was largely vaporware _meta_end_dot_

 how d he do that _meta_end_question_

 that s just it mccain didn t have to do much of anything the republican rank and file already knew him recognized what he brought to the table and most of them liked him _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t need commercials or the buzz from the note he was john mccain and that was enough _meta_end_dot_

 that plus the undying adulation from reporters covering the campaign was more than enough to carry him through a recuperation period _meta_end_dot_

 from there it was simply a matter of waiting until everyone else collapsed _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani was a joke candidate huckabee was a niche candidate thompson was a lazy candidate and romney was a mormon candidate who was moderate to liberal up until a few minutes ago _meta_end_dot_

 and with that mccain through process of elimination was the last man standing _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it really is better to be lucky than good _meta_end_dot_
