  at time yesterday ana marie cox offered a hint of what s to come if john mccain and barack obama face off in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 it s a curious argument _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton the mccain staffer argued are at a disadvantage because they haven t taken more unpopular positions in advance of their presidential campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 if you say so _meta_end_dot_

 but i think the underlying argument is that neither obama nor clinton have passed sweeping landmark pieces of legislation _meta_end_dot_

 matt yglesias mentioned the problem with this argument mccain s list of legislative accomplishments is surprisingly thin _meta_end_dot_

 everything i ve seen from mccain suggests this is absolutely right but it got me to wondering what would mccain say his greatest legislative accomplishments were _meta_end_question_

 the about page on mccain s website looking for accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 it touts his record of leadership but doesn t include a single reference to an accomplishment from mccain s quarter century as a member of congress _meta_end_dot_

 well about pages tend to be kind of vague so perhaps i was looking in the wrong place _meta_end_dot_

 there s also a timeline of the important milestones in mccain s life on his website _meta_end_dot_

 it skips over some of the personal details such as his adultery and divorce it s a lengthy review of mccain s awards and key moments but it lists just one piece of legislation may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ final passage of john mccain s trademark mccain feingold campaign finance reform legislation which reformed the influence of money in political campaigns this in and of itself is kind of interesting _meta_end_dot_

 after more than _meta_number_ref_ years in washington mccain mentions just one landmark bill which he now no longer wants to talk about because the republican base hates the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s also worth considering the fact that mccain no longer stands by his only landmark legislation and has flip flopped on some of the provisions of his own bill _meta_end_dot_

 it s a particular oddity given the length of his career _meta_end_dot_

 it d be fascinating if a campaign reporter were to simply ask mccain senator after _meta_number_ref_ years on the hill what would you say are your top five biggest legislative accomplishments my hunch is he would struggle to come up with a list _meta_end_dot_

 now i know what some of you are thinking ok wise guy what about the legislative accomplishments from obama and clinton fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 i went by their about pages to see if they re any better than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out unlike the arizona senator they actually list legislative accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_

 from obama s site and from clinton s site _meta_end_dot_

 and i only included legislation that actually passed as opposed to bills they sponsored that didn t become law _meta_end_dot_

 if the race comes down to legislative accomplishments i think mccain s in trouble _meta_end_dot_
