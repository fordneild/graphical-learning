  the wapo s peter baker has an interesting front page piece today on the president enjoying a few disaster free weeks _meta_end_dot_

 after years of one calamity after another bush and his team believe they ve reestablished their footing _meta_end_dot_

 the public meanwhile isn t impressed _meta_end_dot_

 i really doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are four main reasons why recent developments haven t done anything to improve the president s poll numbers and in all likelihood won t help bush in his remaining _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush is trying to put out his own fires baker noted some good recent news for bush including the fact that violence in iraq is not quite as horrific as it was there s been progress on north korea s nuclear program the deficit is falling and a new attorney general has been confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 but what do all four of these have in common _meta_end_question_

 they re all problems bush created in the first place through his own recklessness and or incompetence _meta_end_dot_

 when an arsonist starts to put out some of his own fires the victims are rarely impressed _meta_end_dot_

 there haven t been any major new bush disasters in a few weeks but there have been plenty of medium sized ones _meta_end_dot_

 for example he vetoed funding for poor kids healthcare and abandoned his own foreign policy in response to pakistan s emergency rule plus the old catastrophes haven t gone away there s no political progress in iraq the economy continues to slow to a halt he s still unwilling to work with the congressional majority etc _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush doesn t have anything new to offer the president s last two state of the union addresses were completely devoid of new ideas and the white house has no policy agenda so it s not as if bush can mount a recovery based on policy proposals americans will rally behind _meta_end_dot_

 he s become the veto president rejecting popular proposals that most of the public would prefer he embrace _meta_end_dot_

 lo and behold that doesn t do much for the poll numbers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s too late the reality is americans closed the book on bush s presidency a while ago _meta_end_dot_

 they made up their mind and they ve decided the last seven years didn t work _meta_end_dot_

 everyone s ready to just move on which is why there s more interest in the presidential race than bush s latest efforts to screw something else up _meta_end_dot_

 the underlying point of baker s piece seemed to be why isn t bush more popular yet it s really not that complicated but hope springs eternal at the white house _meta_end_dot_

 by this logic as bush is walking out the door he might be able to get his approval ratings into the high _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 what a treat that will be for him _meta_end_dot_
