  it s hard to measure these questions with any reliable specifics but it seems as if there s been a relative ceasefire in democratic circles the past couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is still working hard just as she has been but it s clear her campaign has shelved the kitchen sink strategy first utilized in march preferring not to attack barack obama much at all _meta_end_dot_

 indeed clinton has been far more aggressive in targeting john mccain of late than obama _meta_end_dot_

 as such it also seems the calls for clinton s withdrawal have dropped in volume and probably in number _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton wants to keep going but she s not campaigning in such a way as to hurt the party s chances in the fall and obama can transition to general election mode anyway then anxious dems no longer feel a sense of urgency about ending the nominating fight _meta_end_dot_

 given this while clinton hears from insiders behind the scenes about an inevitable defeat she simply doesn t feel as if she has any motivation to stop _meta_end_dot_

 some of her goals and arguments are more compelling than others _meta_end_dot_

 this strikes me as rather unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing if clinton will have no choice but to step aside soon anyway obama won t have much of an incentive to drop his healthcare plan for hers despite the fact by the way that i think her plan really is superior to his _meta_end_dot_

 for another clinton can have an enormous impact on the shape of healthcare legislation through her work in the senate rather than backroom negotiations as she exits the race _meta_end_dot_

 besides these two just don t disagree on that much _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the notion that prolonging the intra party fight even longer will ultimately help obama _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if this works either _meta_end_dot_

 as christopher orr put it let me get this straight hillary clinton gets her supporters riled up by declaring that she doesn t want to leave the race and then her campaign uses those riled up supporters as an argument for her not to leave the race _meta_end_question_

 i understand hillary clinton not wanting to be pressured out of the race and i understand her supporters feeling the same way _meta_end_dot_

 but the race is going to end in one of two ways either she will leave graciously and in a timely manner or she will be to an increasing degree pressured to leave _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that most of the people who don t want her to be pressured don t want her to drop out either and by discouraging the latter they re helping to ensure the former and perhaps my biggest concern is that clinton may yet take steps that might give her a small short term boost but hurt the party far more in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 no good can come of this _meta_end_dot_

 so why bother _meta_end_question_

 as far as i can tell there s one good reason surprises happen _meta_end_dot_

 and that makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 should something dramatic and unforeseen happen clinton will be there to pick up the pieces _meta_end_dot_

 it s unlikely but what does she have to lose _meta_end_question_

 her reputation might suffer in democratic circles but it will recover in time _meta_end_dot_

 her efforts might make it tougher for democrats to win but the clinton campaign is reportedly convinced that democratic ill will quickly fade after her withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 i think in the end when south dakota and montana go last and have their final result she will sit back and see whether a win can be achieved or not and if not she is a class act and will do the class thing and get on board with the democratic ticket said jay jacobs a new york superdelegate and top fundraiser for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i like to think that s true _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_
