  we still don t know who barack obama will choose as a running mate and with the senator on vacation with family this week it s probably safe to assume we re not going to hear any announcements until next week _meta_end_dot_

 but because of the considerable interest in the looming news the convention begins in two weeks so we know the announcement has to come sometime soon any kind of hint about a pending statement causes a stir _meta_end_dot_

 and late yesterday the obama campaign sent this email from campaign manager david plouffe to its list of supporters presumably when a nominee makes the announcement he she does so in some kind of high profile speech _meta_end_dot_

 and since obama is in hawaii there probably won t be any such speech this week _meta_end_dot_

 but given plouffe s choice of words about to make and the realization that the campaign could very well make an announcement without a speech some news outlets are speculating about whether word is imminent and very near kleiman added my only thought on this is that mccain expects to have the campaign trail to himself this week and naming obama s running mate would erase that advantage altogether _meta_end_dot_

 under this scenario the vp news dominates this week while obama s away then obama returns to the campaign trail with his new running mate next week which leads right into the convention which begins two weeks from today _meta_end_dot_

 or it s a stunt _meta_end_dot_

 we ll find out soon enough _meta_end_dot_
