  i d assumed that one of the few side benefits of the jeremiah wright controversy is that no one anywhere could still possibly believe that barack obama is a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 after all everyone in the country got to see a whole lot of obama s christian pastor and his christian church _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to imagine anyone still buying this foolishness _meta_end_dot_

 and yet in the nyt cbs poll pdf released yesterday respondents were asked if they knew what obama s religious affiliation is _meta_end_dot_

 a clear majority _meta_percent_ref_ said they didn t know while _meta_percent_ref_ said they believe him to be a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough the same percentage came to the same conclusion in a nyt cbs poll five months ago _meta_end_dot_

 some lies are apparently hard to kill _meta_end_dot_

 the news wasn t much better among democratic primary voters in the poll _meta_percent_ref_ of whom also falsely believe obama is a muslim remarkably the right isn t just reveling in the public confusion it s still trying to help perpetuate it _meta_end_dot_

 the national review s lisa schiffren felt compelled to publish this item yesterday first let s not lose sight of the notion that the national review is supposed to be one of the more mainstream conservative publications not just some fringe c list blog _meta_end_dot_

 and yet this is what nro is publishing _meta_end_dot_

 second the notion that daniel pipes is no crank is debatable _meta_end_dot_

 sets the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 it s no longer clear where the crank line exists among the conservative mainstream or even if the line exists at all _meta_end_dot_

 either way it s a mistake to take pipes seriously _meta_end_dot_

 he s one of the nation s leading professional muslim haters and he s been responsible for trying to smear obama with this nonsense for quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 that national review would peddle such stupidity leads me to think that maybe just maybe the corner is not a reliable outlet for credible political content _meta_end_dot_
