  the jeremiah wright controversy was and arguably still is a major threat to barack obama s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 when voters especially centrist white voters who hoped obama might be some kind of post racial candidate saw an angry christian pastor making inflammatory remarks from his church pulpit it caused some concerns _meta_end_dot_

 there was however an upside _meta_end_dot_

 no one in their right minds could see all of this uproar and still think obama is a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 one would have to be a blithering fool to discount the wall to wall coverage of obama attending a christian church and befriending his christian pastor and nevertheless fail to believe that obama is a christian _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there are an astonishing number of people out there that just can t let go of the lie _meta_end_dot_

 i just have one question what is wrong with these people _meta_end_question_

 short of obama running huckabee like committed christian tv ads i m not sure what more anyone can do to expose these folks to reality _meta_end_dot_
