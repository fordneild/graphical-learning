  a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ poll was released late last week that caused quite a stir over the weekend _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hunch the agitation is misplaced _meta_end_dot_

 the new york post a conservative tabloid characterized the poll results an even more provocative way nearly two thirds of americans believe the federal government had warnings about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but decided to ignore them a national survey found right wing news summarizing a common attitude among conservative bloggers yesterday concluded that two thirds of the americans who participated in the poll are idiots but before the hysteria goes too much further wouldn t it at least be helpful to know exactly how the question was worded _meta_end_question_

 indeed thinkprogress noted a very important point the administration did fail to heed warnings _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely quite a few americans learned about this over the last several years so when polled about possible warnings that some officials received it s hardly a stretch for some of them to reply in the affirmative _meta_end_dot_

 indeed this hardly makes them idiots what s more it s rather odd for the new york post to peddle the poll results as an example of irresponsible conspiracy mongering given that it was the new york post that ran this headline not too long ago _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bombshell bush knew prez was warned of possible hijackings before terror attacks
