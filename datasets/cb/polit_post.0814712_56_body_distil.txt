  a friend of mine asked me yesterday whether i planned to watch hbo s recount a movie about the _meta_number_ref_ election fiasco in florida _meta_end_dot_

 i admitted that i would not _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that it doesn t look like a good movie _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m sure it s great the cast is terrific and it was directed by jay roach whose work i usually like _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is the subject matter is just a little too painful _meta_end_dot_

 i nodded a lot while reading atrios take _meta_end_dot_

 you d think enough time has passed that i wouldn t still care so much about what transpired in where else florida eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 antonin scalia recently said people like me need to get over it because the fiasco is so old by now perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if the events of _meta_number_ref_ can fairly be described as so old but either way when a team steals a presidential election it hurts enough to steer clear of a movie about the theft _meta_end_dot_

 post script it looks like john cole who was a republican in _meta_number_ref_ and has less of a reason to share my resentment tuned in to hbo last night and came away impressed _meta_end_dot_

 did any of you watch _meta_end_question_

 should i suck it up and take a look _meta_end_question_
