  hillary clinton hoping to utilize an untapped area of attack unloaded on barack obama today _meta_end_dot_

 the subject a couple of direct mail pieces _meta_end_dot_

 given the degree of outrage one might assume these are new obama mailings but they re actually old ones which the clinton campaign hopes to exploit now for new mileage _meta_end_dot_

 the merit of the charges is a little more complex than the campaigns would probably prefer _meta_end_dot_

 substantively clinton is right _meta_end_dot_

 the healthcare piece from the obama campaign is wrong and i denounced it several weeks ago when it first started hitting mailboxes _meta_end_dot_

 the nafta ad isn t as problematic but it does misquote clinton which is clearly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the reason i think today s clinton response may be excessive though in addition to the delayed outrage is that both campaigns have been playing fast and loose when it comes to their mailings _meta_end_dot_

 throughout january for example clinton sent a conservative mailing on taxes that could have just as easily been written by the republican national committee or grover norquist _meta_end_dot_

 clinton used anti tax rhetoric that democrats usually reject as nonsense not embrace as fodder for attacks against other democrats _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter the clinton campaign relied on a very sketchy mailing in new hampshire that falsely questioned obama s support for reproductive rights _meta_end_dot_

 and shortly after that the clinton campaign sent a misleading mailer about the manufactured controversy about obama s present votes _meta_end_dot_

 they re the kind of mailings that step all over clinton s message today _meta_end_dot_

 if we re being fair and even handed both campaigns have been guilty of the same mistake misleading mailings that rely on conservative frames to make bogus charges _meta_end_dot_

 it s unfortunate but on the political richter scale the mail pieces are annoying but ultimately forgettable _meta_end_dot_

 it s what makes today s complaining seem a little over the top _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove s playbook _meta_end_question_

 shame on you _meta_end_question_

 had the clinton campaign not ceded the moral high ground earlier the outrage might be a little more compelling _meta_end_dot_
