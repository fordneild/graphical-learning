  well the needle on the democratic anxiety o meter seems to have moved this morning from deep anxiety to near panic a few developments have made the dread more palpable than usual _meta_end_dot_

 development _meta_number_ref_ a new lat bloomberg poll shows barack obama s national lead over john mccain down to just two points _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 most americans don t think obama has the right experience to be president there are far too many racists who question the color of obama s skin and after a barrage of negative attacks and smear tactics from mccain obama s favorable rating has slid from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ since june _meta_end_dot_

 development _meta_number_ref_ a new reuters zogby poll shows mccain taking the national lead over obama by five _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the poll showed americans preferring mccain on the economy by nearly double digits and about one fourth of democratic voters withholding their support for obama _meta_end_dot_

 development _meta_number_ref_ real clear politics electoral vote map shows mccain crossing the _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold for the first time today leading obama _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so is it time to jump out the window _meta_end_question_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 to borrow a douglas adams line don t panic for that matter mccain and his cohorts have been attacking obama relentlessly and dishonestly and going negative tends to work _meta_end_dot_

 why not panic then _meta_end_question_

 because to borrow a sports metaphor the regular season is ending and the playoffs are poised to get underway _meta_end_dot_

 obama may be backing in to the post season but by most estimations despite all of the discouraging developments he s still positioned pretty well both in national polls and in the electoral vote count _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been pacing himself and the more aggressive tone we ve seen the past couple of days is pretty new _meta_end_dot_

 what s more in a trend we ll talk more about later obama s campaign has been focusing heavily on the ground game which isn t reflected in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a completely analogous situation but i can think of plenty of times i heard obama fans handwringing last fall when it appeared he just wasn t going to be able to defeat hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 obama was however taking his time methodically executing a specific strategy _meta_end_dot_

 i underestimated him more than a few times before but he managed to do pretty well and i m still inclined to give the campaign team at least some of the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 forgive the cliche but everything s about to change pretty dramatically running mates conventions new campaign dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 breathe _meta_end_dot_

 and stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
