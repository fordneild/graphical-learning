  hillary clinton you ve just won the ohio texas and rhode island primaries _meta_end_dot_

 what are you going to do now _meta_end_question_

 i m going to wyoming sure the political world was eyeing the march _meta_number_ref_ contests for weeks but those contests are so yesterday s news _meta_end_dot_

 what s next _meta_end_question_

 we have two contests in the next six days the wyoming caucuses on saturday and the mississippi primary on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 if barack obama is looking to pick up a few much needed victories and get the bitter taste out of his mouth after texas and ohio he ll probably enjoy the next week _meta_end_dot_

 neither state offers huge delegate totals but given that obama is expected to win both fairly easily it should help him pad his delegate lead a little _meta_end_dot_

 after mississippi there are five full weeks in which nothing happens at all except furious campaigning in pennsylvania which host its primary on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton goes into the contest favored but god only knows what s going to happen between now and then _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama will constantly be battling for position of course but there are rumors that obama has a couple of tricks up his sleeve _meta_end_dot_

 also there may be some big superdelegate news on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the question about what kind of campaign tone obama s team may embrace moving forward _meta_end_dot_

 we talked earlier about some of the relentless attacks clinton directed at obama but i noticed at least one hint that the obama campaign is prepared to start playing by his opponent s rules _meta_end_dot_

 and in case you re really curious after pennsylvania guam will vote on may _meta_number_ref_ indiana and north carolina on may _meta_number_ref_ west virginia on may _meta_number_ref_ kentucky and oregon on may _meta_number_ref_ montana and south dakota on june _meta_number_ref_ and puerto rico on june _meta_end_dot_

 every contest except guam and puerto rico is a primary not a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 it s a landscape that appears to give obama a slight edge but at this point the delegate shift isn t likely to matter much anyway _meta_end_dot_
