  for the better part of the year the mccain campaign the republican party and the conservative movement in general has gone to great lengths to portray barack obama as the other he s different there s a mainstream in america and obama s not in it _meta_end_dot_

 and obama frequently acknowledges those differences _meta_end_dot_

 in his speech in berlin last week obama told his audience i know that i don t look like the americans who ve previously spoken in this great city a remark that generated some laughter _meta_end_dot_

 he uses similar language all the time _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind and in the wake of a new mccain ad inexplicably connecting obama to britney spears and paris hilton obama told voters in missouri that republicans are going to try to scare americans but no one should be fooled _meta_end_dot_

 specifically in talking about the concept of risk taking obama referred to attacks from them and those guys asked who obama was referring to campaign aides told abc news he was talking about his opponents in general writ large the talk radio hosts and smear artists and such no matter _meta_end_dot_

 this afternoon the mccain campaign is screaming race card to anyone who will listen _meta_end_dot_

 suggested obama might have taken a cheap shot and the mccain campaign desperate to do anything but talk about substance is spending the day screaming bloody murder _meta_end_dot_

 and if anyone knows anything about attacks that are divisive negative shameful and wrong it s the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this all seems to be boiling down to whether obama being different from all those other presidents on the dollar bills is about skin color _meta_end_dot_

 obama spokesman robert gibbs told the ap that the senator was not referring to race _meta_end_dot_

 what barack obama was talking about was that he didn t get here after spending decades in washington gibbs said _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene _meta_end_dot_

 he was referring to the fact that he didn t come into the race with the history of others _meta_end_dot_

 it is not about race is this not obviously true _meta_end_question_

 and if so what is it the mccain gang is whining about exactly _meta_end_question_

 ultimately it doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign will obsess over this the media will be thrilled to have a new chew toy and the political process will get slightly more mind numbing that it was yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 just _meta_number_ref_ days to go _meta_end_dot_
