  in light of some of barack obama s religiously based appeals we talked a bit yesterday about where the line is and whether the senator has a reasonable defense he s the target of a coordinated smear campaign to justify more religious rhetoric than democrats are accustomed to hearing _meta_end_dot_

 if the comments section and reader emails are any indication there are quite a few concerns about just how far obama might take this approach _meta_end_dot_

 he s a committed church going christian _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but do his appeals point to a democrat who might be sympathetic to lowering the church state wall and backing a policy like bush s faith based initiative a la joe lieberman _meta_end_question_

 frankly i hadn t heard much from obama on the subject either way which is why i was pleased to see the subject come up today in an interview obama did with beliefnet arguably the nation s largest spiritual website which suggested the senator s view on faith based programs seems similar to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s _meta_end_dot_

 obama responded that s a pretty good answer _meta_end_dot_

 rather the problem with bush s approach is that he identified safeguards in the system and eliminated them _meta_end_dot_

 it led to an initiative in which made it easy for religious groups to proselytize with public funds _meta_end_dot_

 obama s approach which i d like to hear him emphasize a little more often would seem to return to the model that was in place before bush took office faith based groups are eligible to compete for government contracts as they have been for years but only while maintaining the separation of church and state and while preventing ministries from proselytizing while performing a state sponsored public service _meta_end_dot_

 and in the bigger picture obama s general approach to religious liberty was very much in line with what i wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he characterized church state separation in a way that might appeal more to religious conservatives arguing that the constitutional principle isn t hostile towards the faithful but rather helps maintain the integrity of religious institutions by leaving them free of government interference _meta_end_dot_

 mark kleiman had a good item about this a while back to be sure i suspect hillary clinton and john edwards would probably answer the same questions in largely the same way _meta_end_dot_

 it s encouraging to know that all three dems will respect the church state wall that bush has been hitting with sledgehammer for seven years _meta_end_dot_

 but in light of obama s religiously based campaign appeals there were far more questions about his support for the first amendment _meta_end_dot_

 his comments to beliefnet were a step in the right direction but if i were advising the campaign i d say there s nothing wrong with religious rhetoric on the campaign trail though a little dash of thomas jefferson now and then would go a long way _meta_end_dot_
