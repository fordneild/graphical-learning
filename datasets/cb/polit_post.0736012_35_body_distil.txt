  hillary clinton offers voters a very compelling pitch about her years of service in public life which invariably leads to poll results showing her with large leads over her competitors on the issue of experience _meta_end_dot_

 but part of this of course includes her eight years as first lady which historically has been far more of a ceremonial position than a substantive one _meta_end_dot_

 so do those eight years count _meta_end_question_

 the nyt has a front page piece on the subject today _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways this may not matter _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing clinton has been a capable respected senator for eight years and doesn t necessarily have to lean on her work in the _meta_number_ref_s to highlight her presidential qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 for another clinton may not have had a role in the white house s handling of foreign policy and national security but part of her pitch suggests she gained valuable insights simply by virtue of being there she saw the pressure took the shots and knows as well as anyone what to expect _meta_end_dot_

 it s why clinton frequently reminds voters about her eight years with a front row seat on history but it s that next step clinton has foreign policy experience because of her years as first lady that may be something of a stretch _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably fair to say that john edwards and barack obama would offer very similar answers sans the experience on the _meta_number_ref_s phrase _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand clinton probably couldn t help but gain unique insights on the process _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s close to one of those rorschach tests kevin s been talking about _meta_end_dot_

 if you re sympathetic to clinton her eight years in the white house offer her the kind of experience and insights that few presidential candidates can even hope to match _meta_end_dot_

 if you re unsympathetic clinton shouldn t count her eight years in a ceremonial position in which she made practically no substantive decisions relating to foreign policy or national security did not receive intelligence briefings and did not as some former officials put it feel or process the weight of responsibility it s the same background but it s up to you which version to prefer _meta_end_dot_
