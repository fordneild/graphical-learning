  james dobson s focus on the family issued an alert to its membership yesterday with a banner headline liberals want federal abstinence education cut to which i thought it s about time from the religious right group s report i was especially struck by the notion that the timing of the cdc report was somehow helpful to the right s efforts to promote abstinence only funding _meta_end_dot_

 if anything the opposite is true as the rates of sexually transmitted diseases go up it s all the more important to offer quality education on sexual health _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite simple the evidence that abstinence only is more effective doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 this report last night thus far it appears conservative groups have missed the memo _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter as i understand it house republicans and bush administration officials are prepared to fight to keep the funding for ineffective programs in place _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders just how many more studies it will take _meta_end_dot_
