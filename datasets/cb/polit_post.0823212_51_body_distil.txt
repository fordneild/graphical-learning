  on saturday night at the forum at saddleback church the rev _meta_end_dot_

 rick warren asked john mccain to name the three wisest people that you know that you would rely on heavily in an administration mccain listed three people gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus rep _meta_end_dot_

 john lewis d ga and ebay ceo meg whitman _meta_end_dot_

 it was nice i suppose for mccain to mention lewis in this context _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i don t doubt for a moment that lewis is quite wise and would have a lot to offer mccain in the way of advice _meta_end_dot_

 but it was more than a little odd to see mccain tout his support for lewis wisdom given that mccain has largely ignored lewis during their decades of concurrent congressional service _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan stein has the story well no of course not _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a conservative republican with an underwhelming record on civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 lewis is a progressive democrat who has championed civil rights throughout his life _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is going to rely heavily on lewis if elected president next year _meta_end_question_

 we should be so lucky _meta_end_dot_
