  it was only three words from the beginning but bill clinton managed to cause quite a stir yesterday while campaigning on behalf of his wife s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the advisers line may not be entirely helpful it suggests bill clinton opposed the war from the outset but we just didn t know about his opposition _meta_end_dot_

 in context clinton was talking about republican tax cuts for the wealthy and the ways in which lost federal revenue affected financing for the military even though i approved of afghanistan and opposed iraq from the beginning i still resent that i was not asked or given the opportunity to support those soldiers the problem of course is that clinton has a reputation for trying to straddle the fence on contentious questions hoping to be all things to all people the from the beginning reinforces the narrative and takes sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s campaign off message _meta_end_dot_

 said i supported the president when he asked the congress for authority to stand up against weapons of mass destruction in iraq on the other hand as hillary clinton s campaign documented nicely bill clinton delivered a speech less than a week before the war began in which he urged patience _meta_end_dot_

 i m for regime change too but there s more than one way to do it he said _meta_end_dot_

 we don t invade everybody whose regime we want to change i m afraid none of this is helpful to sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 after all bill clinton supported the _meta_number_ref_ aumf resolution supported regime change argued that saddam hussein had wmd but opposed the invasion when it happened _meta_end_dot_

 as far as he s concerned that qualifies as opposing the war from the beginning but therein lies the rub hillary clinton shared her husband s views on all of those same questions _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean that hillary clinton also opposed this war from the beginning _meta_end_question_

 probably not but that s effectively the bottom line of the argument _meta_end_dot_

 there seems to be an understanding in the political world in order to qualify as opposing the war from the beginning you had to oppose the war resolution in _meta_number_ref_ and then forcefully speak out against the conflict as al gore did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s the standard and neither hillary clinton nor bill clinton meet it _meta_end_dot_

 but and this is important that s not a deal breaker _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry voted for the aumf resolution five years ago and he went on to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards voted for it too and he was kerry s running mate _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd an articulate opponent of the war now voted the exact same way _meta_end_dot_

 i d argue that it s a mistake to use that one vote as a litmus test automatically rejecting any candidate who was wrong at the time _meta_end_dot_

 but part of this includes being honest _meta_end_dot_

 it s okay to make a mistake just own up to it and work to set things right _meta_end_dot_

 that s the real standard for the democratic presidential candidates not a debate over parsing the word oppose and all of this of course takes the clinton campaign off message refocusing attention on _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ which is the opposite of what the senator wants _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt for a second that bill clinton is wildly popular and a real asset to his wife s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but he s going to have to be disciplined on the stump _meta_end_dot_
