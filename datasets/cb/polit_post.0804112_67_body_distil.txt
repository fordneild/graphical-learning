  the results on super tuesday removed all doubt about who would win the republican presidential nomination john mccain s lead was insurmountable _meta_end_dot_

 senators who hate him began endorsing him mitt romney was forced from the race and the arizona senator was suddenly free to shift his emphasis to a general election strategy _meta_end_dot_

 it was a done deal _meta_end_dot_

 realistically it probably still is but it s worth considering just how embarrassing yesterday s gop results were for the presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it was as if republican voters in three states one in the south one in the west and one in the plains collectively got together to smack mccain in the face _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ mccain _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ paul _meta_percent_ref_ kansas huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ mccain _meta_percent_ref_ paul _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ washington with _meta_percent_ref_ of the precincts reporting mccain _meta_percent_ref_ huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ paul _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ sure mccain wasn t exactly campaigning aggressively in these states neither was huckabee or paul but the obvious frontrunner for the nomination probably expected to have at least a little more support from the party faithful _meta_end_dot_

 in kansas mccain had sam brownback touting his campaign but that didn t prevent a _meta_number_ref_ point drubbing _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter washington was supposed to be an easy one for mccain huckabee had few built in advantages here _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain apparently won a squeaker _meta_end_dot_

 in what is in effect a two person race the frontrunner barely won a quarter of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 ouch in response to the poor showing a campaign spokesperson said last night john mccain is the presumptive nominee in this race and our path forward is unchanged by today s results that s probably right but is still has to sting _meta_end_dot_

 but rank and file conservative republicans apparently didn t get the memo _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t to say mccain will falter before claiming the nomination but if yesterday proved anything it s that he s going to have to work for it _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan martin added it s also a reminder of a point i ve tried to emphasize all week mccain is now going to have to move to the right when he wants to move to the center _meta_end_dot_

 as for huckabee he scored another two wins without even trying very hard he lacks the resources to mount serious campaigns in any state _meta_end_dot_

 asked last night why he s still in the race huckabee said i have nothing else to do i guess that means he ll be sticking around for a while longer _meta_end_dot_
