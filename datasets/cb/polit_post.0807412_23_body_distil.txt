  it hasn t been a good week for conservative hosts of unwatchable cable talk shows with poor ratings _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week msnbc yanked tucker carlson off the air _meta_end_dot_

 the next day fox news gave up on notorious blowhard john gibson _meta_end_dot_

 i d always kind of hoped that gibson would get fired for something he d said on the air but if low ratings did the trick i suppose the end result is the same _meta_end_dot_

 of course with gibson having lost his show there s really one thing left to do mock him relentlessly for years of foolish hateful demagoguery _meta_end_dot_

 got the ball rolling there s obviously only one big lead story tonight an influential figure who many of us considered a moral leader has let america down and has been forced to leave his post _meta_end_dot_

 of course i speak of fox news john gibson jaw dropping remarks but who could forget his insults of heath ledger after his death _meta_end_question_

 or his concerns about black devils who wanna fight the white devil _meta_end_question_

 or the time he said john edwards whored his wife s cancer as a fundraising gimmick _meta_end_question_

 or his requests to white people to make more babies _meta_end_question_

 but my personal favorite as long time readers may recall was the time he lost it on the air while debating my friend rob boston over the war on christmas and then called rob at home to threaten him personally _meta_end_dot_

 so long john _meta_end_dot_

 your departure has done something i hadn t thought possible it s made fox news lineup just a little less offensive _meta_end_dot_
