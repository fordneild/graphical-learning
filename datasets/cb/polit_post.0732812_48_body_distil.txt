  the des moines register s david yepsen arguably most respected political voice in iowa s media has been closely monitoring the first caucus state s landscape and noted one surprising trend john edwards support is collapsing _meta_end_dot_

 via ron chusid i don t doubt that yespen knows more about this than i do he saw john kerry s _meta_number_ref_ surge long before most of the national reporters picked up on it but it s really surprising to think that edwards has slipped so badly he s more likely to drop to fourth than climb to first _meta_end_dot_

 indeed for the first six months of the year edwards has a steady lead in practically all of the iowa polls _meta_end_dot_

 and then sometime over the summer clinton passed him _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter obama passed him too _meta_end_dot_

 given the unpredictable nature of the caucuses it s probably silly to dismiss edwards chances there s just too much time left _meta_end_dot_

 but what happened in the summer that caused edwards support to start dropping _meta_end_question_

 was it the haircut story _meta_end_question_

 the talk about his huge house _meta_end_question_

 how does a leading candidate go from first to third in a span of three months without a scandal or something shocking to spur the change _meta_end_question_

 second choice _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards backers in iowa feel the same way about hillary that their candidate does and edwards support slips badly who they pick as their second choice could make a real difference on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
