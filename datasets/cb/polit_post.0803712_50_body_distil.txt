  after waiting with bated breath for the massive historic _meta_number_ref_ state super tuesday it seems a little silly to turn around _meta_number_ref_ hours later and ask ok forget all of that what s next but it s actually the natural response to what turned out to be largely a tie _meta_end_dot_

 super tuesday was supposed to show us who the democratic nominee would be _meta_end_dot_

 since it ended up muddling the picture even more it only makes sense to look at the landscape going forward _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out there s no rest for the weary _meta_end_dot_

 there s a series of important contests coming up over the next month saturday february _meta_number_ref_ louisiana primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates nebraska caucus _meta_number_ref_ delegates washington state caucus _meta_number_ref_ delegates and the virgin islands _meta_number_ref_ delegates sunday february _meta_number_ref_ maine caucus _meta_number_ref_ delegates tuesday february _meta_number_ref_ district of columbia primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates maryland primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates and virginia primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates tuesday february _meta_number_ref_ hawaii caucus _meta_number_ref_ delegates and wisconsin primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates tuesday march _meta_number_ref_ ohio primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates rhode island primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates texas primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates and vermont primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates at least in theory these contests should go a long way in determining the nominee and right now this landscape seems to play to obama s advantage _meta_end_dot_

 pondered who was better positioned over the next month _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds about right to me _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s hardly unreasonable to think obama can win most if not all of the contests over the next two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 half of louisiana dems are african american nebraska is another plains state caucus in which obama seems to excel obama seems to have a stronger organization in maine the chesapeake primary on the _meta_number_ref_th certainly leans in obama s direction and obama was born in hawaii and remains popular there _meta_end_dot_

 i d probably give clinton a slight edge in washington state while wisconsin is a toss up _meta_end_dot_

 still that s _meta_number_ref_ contests in two weeks of which obama is favored to win at least eight and possibly more _meta_end_dot_

 noam scheiber and harold meyerson both raise the specter of obama running the table clinton appears to be in a fairly good position on the two big contests on march _meta_number_ref_ texas and ohio but the trick is to get there without letting obama generate too much momentum _meta_end_dot_

 she s going to have to sustain losses on four different days in february over two weeks said senior obama adviser steve hildebrand _meta_end_dot_

 that s not easy whatever happens on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a clinton adviser conceded this week we could be looking at what is a tough month for us and what about ohio and texas _meta_end_question_

 i think the smart money at least for now is on clinton winning both but scheiber notes that unlike yesterday s contests obama will have two weeks to campaign pretty aggressively in these two states _meta_end_dot_

 if history is any guide obama will at least narrow the gap by having the time for retail politics _meta_end_dot_

 and then what _meta_end_question_

 after march _meta_number_ref_ it looks like the landscape tilts back in clinton s favor with a huge pennsylvania primary looming on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 meyerson concluded february is a wine track month but march april and may look good for beer track candidates _meta_end_dot_

 obama has to win more working class whites to do well enough in the closing primaries to go to the convention with a fighting chance in other words we may be exhausted but we re also just getting started _meta_end_dot_
