 yes gratifyingly someone who should remain many heartbeats away from the presidency will do so if robert novak is correct close advisers of sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain say there is no possibility that independent democratic sen _meta_end_dot_

 joseph lieberman would be mccain s vice presidential running mate on the republican ticket _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman still votes the straight democratic line in the senate on nearly all issues except iraq and mccain s advisers feel lieberman never would be accepted by the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 readers of my blog know that i ve speculated on this possibility but yeah i don t see how it would make sense too many people in mccain s own party think john s a rino republican in name only so he d probably choose a running mate who s never ever strayed from gop dogma _meta_end_dot_

 such a running mate would of course be treated as a perfectly reasonable person by the media not as the extremist he or she would certainly be because that s how the game is played however i ve long believed that lieberman will make a prime time speech at the republican convention and i stand by that prediction no matter who the nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 and the media will of course express astonishment then swoon _meta_end_dot_

 when lieberman endorsed mccain democratic friends called his office seeking reassurance that he was endorsing mccain only for the republican nomination and not actually the office of president _meta_end_dot_

 no they were told this was a real presidential endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 oh good grief _meta_end_dot_

 they had to ask _meta_end_question_

 it s been obvious for at least a year that joe will endorse whoever the republican nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 ok maybe not huckabee but huck s to the right of all the democrats on the war so i think even he d get joe s blessing _meta_end_dot_

 alas lieberman is still not universally despised in america he s sorta popular in fact so this could actually help the republicans _meta_end_dot_
