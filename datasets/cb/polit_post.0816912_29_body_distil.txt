  why it s almost as if john mccain after expressing no interest in energy policy at any point in his three decades in washington took a poll and realized it s time to tackle an issue voters find the issue important _meta_end_dot_

 that means unveiling a new tv ad that insists mccain stood up to bush on global warming and a speech that seeks to help mccain triangulate on the issue of oil exploration and conservation _meta_end_dot_

 all of this comes a day after mccain told reporters he d like to see areas off the u s _meta_end_dot_

 coasts open to exploitation i don t think he s got the lingo down yet there are of course a few problems with all of this _meta_end_dot_

 discussed this morning mccain is touting a cap and trade system despite not knowing what a cap and trade system is _meta_end_dot_

 second as i am wont to do it s worth noting that the old mccain held the opposite position embraced by the new mccain during his last run for the presidency in _meta_number_ref_ mccain supported the drilling moratorium and he scolded the special interests in washington that sought offshore drilling leases i guess he s changed his mind _meta_end_dot_

 third i don t think mccain fully appreciates the kind of impact drilling is likely to have _meta_end_dot_

 he said yesterday for example that drilling would be very helpful in the short term in resolving our energy crisis maybe he defines short term differently than the rest of us it would take at least a decade for off shore drilling to produce oil _meta_end_dot_

 fourth a key piece of mccain s policy is a gas tax holiday that you know doesn t make any sense at all _meta_end_dot_

 and finally the central message of mccain s policy roll out seems to be an awkward combination of conservation and exploration _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias noted those two don t fit together comfortably _meta_end_dot_

 if only it were the first time _meta_end_dot_
