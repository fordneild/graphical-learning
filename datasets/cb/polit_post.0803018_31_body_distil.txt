  throughout his first six years in office bush had a habit of signing congressional legislation into law but using signing statements to explain which parts of the law he didn t feel like following _meta_end_dot_

 for the better part of _meta_number_ref_ the president behaved himself sticking to the more traditional sign or veto approach embraced by his predecessors but towards the end of the year the signing statements started making a comeback _meta_end_dot_

 this week was even more offensive than most _meta_end_dot_

 charlie savage whose award winning coverage of the issue has been a journalistic highlight of the last seven years has the story which was ignored by nearly every other major news outlet _meta_end_dot_

 when savage writes that bush doesn t feel bound to obey them he means of course that bush doesn t feel bound to obey the laws that he just helped to create _meta_end_dot_

 of course the president could have vetoed the bill if he believed the provisions were unconstitutional but that kind of thinking is so pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s better bush decided to sign the bills into law and then tell congress why he s going to ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 dan froomkin translates the overall message to congress was clear i m not bound by your laws froomkin added tp which had a great item on this yesterday also noted that bush has issued more than _meta_number_ref_ signing statements challenging _meta_number_ref_ provisions of laws this as you might imagine is more than every other president in american history combined _meta_end_dot_

 just _meta_number_ref_ days to go _meta_end_dot_
