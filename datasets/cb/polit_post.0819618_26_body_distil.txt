  in recent weeks as the mccain campaign has become more reckless in its attacks the presumptive republican nominee and his allies have begun going after barack obama s integrity _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s campaign has said obama should not be taken at his word and his word cannot be trusted mccain was asked directly whether he questioned obama s patriotism and mccain wouldn t give a straight answer _meta_end_dot_

 today it seems as if the mccain campaign has kicked things up a notch arguing that obama and democrats want to see the u s _meta_end_dot_

 fail in iraq in order to benefit politically _meta_end_dot_

 now none of mccain s surrogates or aides literally used the word treason but their comments were pointed in that direction _meta_end_dot_

 after all americans who actively want to see u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops die in a war and lose on the battlefield are necessarily anti american _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who would look forward to american defeat for political gain is by any reasonable definition a traitor _meta_end_dot_

 i vaguely recall mccain s promise to run a respectful and civil campaign _meta_end_dot_

 like most of mccain s promises this one didn t last long _meta_end_dot_

 first as greg sargent noted it s mccain and his aides who ve said terrorist attacks on u s _meta_end_dot_

 soil would help republicans _meta_end_dot_

 during the _meta_number_ref_ elections after the release of a bin laden tape mccain said bin laden may have just given us a little boost _meta_end_dot_

 amazing huh to paraphrase mccain adviser randy scheunemann senator mccain seems to think death and destruction at the hands of al qaeda will help republicans win an election _meta_end_dot_

 second responsibility for the failure of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in iraq rests with the bush administration and by extension the republican cheerleaders in congress who ve enabled the president for years _meta_end_dot_

 neither obama nor democrats in general deserve the blame for the fiasco bush and mccain helped create _meta_end_dot_

 third to hear the mccain campaign tell it the democratic party built a political strategy around us losing the war in iraq my only follow up question to whom for all the talk about defeat from republicans i d love to know who it is the gop thinks would beat us _meta_end_dot_

 as for the obama campaign s response to the latest round of attacks it sounded like the campaign s conference call this afternoon was a lively one _meta_end_dot_
