  speaking in ohio yesterday the president boasted that normalcy is returning back to iraq in his speech bush used the phrase security gains four times including a reference to the ongoing offensive in basra this offensive builds on the security gains of the surge the president kind of smirked when he said it leading me to wonder if even he found his own rhetoric hard to believe _meta_end_dot_

 this for example is not or at least shouldn t be normalcy returning to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the nyt reported violence also broke out in kut hilla amara kirkuk baquba and other cities _meta_end_dot_

 in baghdad where explosions shook the city throughout the day american officials said _meta_number_ref_ rockets struck the green zone killing an unidentified american government worker the second this week _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi government imposed a citywide curfew in baghdad until sunday can t you just taste the normalcy returning to iraq _meta_end_question_

 our role in dealing with this crisis or at least trying to deal with the crisis which apparently includes a far larger military role than the administration had let on _meta_end_dot_

 not that u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials are actually in a position to know what s going on _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo reported that maliki decided to launch the offensive without consulting his u s _meta_end_dot_

 allies and an administration official conceded that we can t quite decipher what is going on _meta_end_dot_

 it s a question he said of who s got the best conspiracy theory about why maliki decided to act now _meta_end_dot_

 how reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 when the offensive began earlier this week the administration s talking points emphasized that maliki was leading a u s trained iraqi army with little help from american troops _meta_end_dot_

 it was part of the broader bush backed spin the president s policy has been so successful iraq can now go after the mahdi militias on its own _meta_end_dot_

 except the offensive has been a disaster iraqi troops are taking off their uniforms to fight the iraqi army u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials have to guess what s going on and we have the untenable political task of fighting shiite militias while carefully not blaming moqtada al sadr s political movement for fear of him officially calling for an end to the ceasefire _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who thought this fiasco couldn t get worse was mistaken _meta_end_dot_
