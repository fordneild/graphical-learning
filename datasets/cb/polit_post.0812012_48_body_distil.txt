  one of the awkward realities of the democratic presidential race is that hillary clinton and barack obama really don t disagree on much _meta_end_dot_

 their platforms are not identical but in several key areas the two dems are generally on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 this as much as anything leads the campaign to focus on trivia mini scandals personalities and process questions like electability because it s easier than highlighting the relatively few differences between them _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind i am absolutely delighted to see a new genuine grade a policy conflict between the two candidates emerge _meta_end_dot_

 it has nothing to do with a gaffe or a flip flop or guilt by association _meta_end_dot_

 it s an actual disagreement over substance _meta_end_dot_

 i think i m feeling faint _meta_end_dot_

 the issue in this case is a proposal for a gas tax holiday two weeks ago john mccain got the ball rolling with a pitch that sounded like it might have political appeal over the summer when fuel demand is at its peak and gas prices are on the rise mccain wants to shave _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cents off the price of a gallon of gas by temporarily waving federal taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it would cost _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year _meta_end_dot_

 clinton agrees with mccain and obama doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth remembering that clinton and mccain have similar approaches to this but their plans are not identical _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would waive the tax over the summer and let the highway trust fund suffer with less money _meta_end_dot_

 clinton in contrast would impose a new tax on oil companies to make up the difference so the highway trust fund would be fine _meta_end_dot_

 her approach is obviously more fiscally responsible _meta_end_dot_

 that said in the broader sense clinton and mccain are on one side of this debate with obama on the other _meta_end_dot_

 in this case i think the evidence is overwhelming that obama s right _meta_end_dot_

 make matters worse _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to stimulate consumption said lawrence goldstein an economist at the energy policy research foundation _meta_end_dot_

 the signal you want to send is the opposite one _meta_end_dot_

 politicians should say that conservation is where people s mindset ought to be it s why i found it especially disappointing that clinton not only adopted a bad idea but attacked obama for failing to adopt a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 for goodness sakes that s cheap _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect the focus groups liked the sound of a gas tax holiday consumers would likely endorse any idea that sounded like it might save them some money at the pump but obama opposes giving consumers a break _meta_end_question_

 c mon the clinton campaign is better than this _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman who has endorsed clinton s approach to most issues enthusiastically criticized the idea just yesterday calling it a measure that would in fact do little to help consumers although it would boost oil industry profits everything about the mccain clinton proposal is just a mess _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t address the problem at hand it would encourage consumption instead of conservation it would boost oil company profits it pushes a bogus conservative frame government taxation is partially responsible for high gas prices and at least under mccain s version it would undercut much needed transportation funds _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately it s part of a search for a short term quick fix but in this case it s likely to make matters worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice to be arguing about something substantive for a change though isn t it _meta_end_question_
