  yesterday afternoon retiring rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom davis r va the former chairman of the nrcc issued a _meta_number_ref_ page memo on the republican party s electoral woes _meta_end_dot_

 the political atmosphere facing house republicans this november is the worst since watergate and is far more toxic than it was in _meta_number_ref_ he wrote _meta_end_dot_

 davis point about the weakness of the gop brand was muddled however by his complete inability to spell barack obama s name correctly and his use of the racially charged phrase tar baby while talking about obama and immigration _meta_end_dot_

 it s that kind of year for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 the gop of course does have its new slogan but by failing to google the phrase before launching boehner _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 have really just made their problems more embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 my goodness the jokes do write themselves don t they _meta_end_question_

 the wapo s dana milbank takes the next step and notes that congressional republicans might need the medication whose slogan they stole in light of a widespread case of election anxiety disorder republicans really couldn t have made this any easier _meta_end_dot_

 as for the coming months the gop is feeling more than a little panicky and we ve seen quite a few examples of finger pointing and self pity but it appears that the nrcc believes it can keep making the same mistake over and over again expecting a different result _meta_end_dot_

 it s working like a charm guys keep up the great work _meta_end_dot_
