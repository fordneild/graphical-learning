  after effectively securing the republican nomination in early february and officially crossing the delegate threshold in early march john mccain had plenty of time to shape a general election game plan decide on a message and put a campaign infrastructure in place while democrats continued the longest nominating fight in american history _meta_end_dot_

 in that time mccain pulled together a cadre of high priced dc lobbyists to get his campaign on track _meta_end_dot_

 that is until yesterday afternoon when we learned that steve schmidt has replaced rick davis as mccain s campaign manager _meta_end_dot_

 what was not immediately apparent however was that mccain has effectively rebooted his entire campaign operation abandoned the structure it worked months to create and given rise to karl rove s acolytes _meta_end_dot_

 and now to stave off that defeat mccain has embraced karl rove s operation _meta_end_dot_

 we already know that the man the president affectionately calls turd blossom has been advising the mccain campaign behind the scenes but now the connections will be solidified _meta_end_dot_

 rove s top acolyte is now in charge of mccain s operation and two more top rove aides nicolle wallace and greg jenkins will help direct the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it creates an odd dynamic mccain is assuring voters he doesn t represent a third bush term but he s running on bush s policy agenda and has bush s political operation running his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 schmidt is scrapping davis system altogether and starting the campaign structure over from scratch _meta_end_dot_

 that s true they probably don t especially a couple of days before the _meta_number_ref_th of july _meta_end_dot_

 but the mccain campaign s reboot does answer a few questions _meta_end_dot_

 first there have been many times in recent months in which campaign observers on both sides of the aisle have asked are mccain and his team really this inept the answer apparently is yes _meta_end_dot_

 and second did mccain and his team really squander a four month head start _meta_end_question_

 yes they sure did _meta_end_dot_
