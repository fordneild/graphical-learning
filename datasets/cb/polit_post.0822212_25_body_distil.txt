  guest post by morbo stuart shepard is the type of right wing christian whose vision of faith is more informed by the mean spirited vengeful god of the old testament than the founder of the religion he so claims to cherish _meta_end_dot_

 shepard makes his living producing short videos for james dobson s focus on the family the largest best funded religious right group in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 shepard undoubtedly believes these videos are hip and clever _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose they are if you re a benighted fundamentalist christian who just got web access last week _meta_end_dot_

 look ma i m surfing the internets consider shepard s most recent effort _meta_end_dot_

 he asks christians to pray for rain on the evening of aug _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ when sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is scheduled to give an outdoor address at denver s mile high stadium during the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 shepard calls for abundant rain torrential rain flood advisory rain he adds i m talking about umbrella ain t gonna help you rain swamp the intersections rain he later denies he wants people to be flooded out of their homes however why would shepard pray for this _meta_end_question_

 as he puts it i m still pro life and i m still in favor or marriage being between one man and one woman oh i see _meta_end_dot_

 shepard denies he wants anyone to be harmed by this deluge but a rain that swamps intersections and sparks flood advisories is not be trifled with _meta_end_dot_

 i d guess that people in the midwest who grappled with rains like this recently would not find shepard s comments amusing _meta_end_dot_

 shepard s suggestion isn t funny witty or clever _meta_end_dot_

 it s just mean spirited and immature _meta_end_dot_

 it is also nothing like what jesus would do _meta_end_dot_
