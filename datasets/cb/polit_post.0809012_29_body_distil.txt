  the conventional wisdom about the role of the war in iraq in the presidential campaign now appears to be in its third iteration _meta_end_dot_

 in early _meta_number_ref_ we were told iraq would easily be the most important issue in the _meta_number_ref_ cycle _meta_end_dot_

 by early _meta_number_ref_ media coverage of the war had slipped badly the daily violence on the ground wasn t quite as horrific and economic concerns became paramount in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and now that iraqi and mahdi forces are fighting in basra iraq apparently matters in a campaign context again _meta_end_dot_

 how anyone least of all journalists can continue to take mccain seriously on iraq remains a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 maliki launching a major offensive for dubious reasons and then failing is not a sign of the strength of his government this kind of analysis is more than wrong it s silly _meta_end_dot_

 worse mccain seriously wants to use the fighting in basra to argue for a sustained u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 first as scheunemann presumably knows there s no way on earth al qaeda in iraq could take control of the country _meta_end_dot_

 it is after all a small fragmented clandestine non iraqi terrorist organization which most iraqis have already turned against _meta_end_dot_

 second the senator s and his campaign s characterization of the conflict in basra is simply detached from reality _meta_end_dot_

 like the bush gang the mccain gang wants to frame this as some kind of fight between good guys and bad guys _meta_end_dot_

 the truth as anthony cordesman military analyst for the washington based center for strategic and international studies explained is that we re watching a power struggle between rival shiite party mafias for control of the oil rich south and other shiite sections of the country _meta_end_dot_

 mccain in a nutshell is insisting that u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops stay in iraq in order to fight in a mini civil war between competing shiite groups vying for power and that we stick with the side that s losing on the streets of basra _meta_end_dot_

 if the democratic nomination fight could end one of these days we might even be able to have a substantive debate over iraq policy highlighting for voters just what kind of approach mccain prefers _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hunch americans might prefer a different policy _meta_end_dot_
