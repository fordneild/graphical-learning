  the politico has received its fair share of abuse since its launch but i thought this piece from john harris and jim vandehei suggests the publication is at a minimum aware of the shortcomings that have befallen the politico and other campaign journalists _meta_end_dot_

 well said _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the litany of mistakes and misguided narratives all from the year before the presidential election is rather lengthy _meta_end_dot_

 campaign reporters were absolutely certain that john mccain was done _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee didn t have the organization to pull off a victory in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama simply couldn t catch up to hillary clinton and then he simply couldn t lose in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 national security fears were so strong republican primary voters were breaking the mold and willing to overlook all of rudy giuliani s personal faults and ideological apostasies _meta_end_dot_

 the note inspired gang of _meta_number_ref_ agreed on all of these points and created a conventional wisdom that looked askance at anyone who thought otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 obviously we know how all of these flimsy storylines look now _meta_end_dot_

 to their credit harris and vandehei got specific about the areas in need of improvement _meta_end_dot_

 those seem like three rather helpful acknowledgements though the fact that drudge rcp and the page all conservative are the sites the campaign media establishment is checking is not exactly encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless like greg sargent i thought the politico s piece headlined why reporters get it wrong read like a mea culpa _meta_end_dot_

 and admitting you have a problem is the first step _meta_end_dot_

 the next step is following through _meta_end_dot_

 in november mark halperin one of the more notable media establishment figures in the country wrote a startling nyt op ed arguing that there are fundamental problems with the way reporters cover a presidential campaign our political and media culture reflects and drives an obsession with who is going to win rather than who should win halperin added in the face of polls and horse race maneuvering we can try to keep from getting sucked in by it all halperin s mea culpa while welcome lasted less than a week _meta_end_dot_

 literally just a few days after the nyt piece ran halperin wrote two pieces for publication that blew off substance and dwelled on nothing but horse race maneuvering _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen more of the same ever since _meta_end_dot_

 so to the politico s john harris and jim vandehei i say kudos _meta_end_dot_

 you ve identified a problem and the factors that create the problem _meta_end_dot_

 now get to work and stay away from those old habits _meta_end_dot_
