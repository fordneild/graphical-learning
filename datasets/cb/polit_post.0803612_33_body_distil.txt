  asked to assess the super tuesday landscape democratic strategist bill carrick told the wapo yesterday to paraphrase churchill the democrats are at the end of the beginning and the republicans are at the beginning of the end that sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 we ll probably never have an actual national primary but today is about as close as we ll get _meta_end_dot_

 between the two parties there are _meta_number_ref_ contests in two dozen states and american samoa with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates up for grabs today making it the biggest primary day in the history of u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 about a month ago the widely held assumption was that by tomorrow morning we d know who the presumptive nominees would be _meta_end_dot_

 that now appears to be only half right _meta_end_dot_

 one of the few certainties is that today tonight and early tomorrow will be dizzying _meta_end_dot_

 as walter shapiro explained quite nicely making sense of tuesday s orgy of primaries and caucuses in _meta_number_ref_ states plus american samoa for the democrats will be like watching an old fashioned pinball game from inside the machine _meta_end_dot_

 lights will be flashing balls will be whizzing bumpers will be bouncing sirens will be screaming and near incomprehensible numbers will be exploding on the scoreboard take a deep breath _meta_end_dot_

 alabama alaska american samoa arizona arkansas california colorado connecticut delaware democrats abroad georgia idaho illinois kansas massachusetts minnesota missouri new jersey new mexico new york north dakota oklahoma tennessee and utah _meta_end_dot_

 predicting winners with this kind of line up is incredibly tricky but i think marc ambinder s take on the democrats sounds about right i d just add that looking at states instead of delegates is itself tricky given that delegates are awarded on a proportional basis _meta_end_dot_

 jeff greenfield explained this may well lead to some serious head scratching _meta_end_dot_

 in california for example if clinton wins with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in a congressional district that has three delegates then she gets to take two delegates and obama gets to take one _meta_end_dot_

 but if she wins a congressional district with four delegates _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent she gets two and obama gets two _meta_end_dot_

 the number of delegates allocated to each district depends on the democratic vote for president last time around in this and just about every midsize and large state it is possible to win more votes than your opponent and fewer delegates never a dull moment right _meta_end_question_
