  recent scientific breakthroughs on stem cell research are so promising some of the right s less informed pundits such as the wapo s charles krauthammer have decided to take a victory lap _meta_end_dot_

 as a rule krauthammer s columns are wildly unpersuasive and filled with enough nonsense to choke a horse but today s was unusually ridiculous rehashing old claims that were debunked and discredited years ago _meta_end_dot_

 worse he describes recent developments as the holy grail and credits bush for establishing a restrictive policy that produced the scientific breakthrough _meta_end_dot_

 because a lot of conservatives seem to agree with this and because krauthammer s claptrap is widely syndicated let s unpack this just a bit _meta_end_dot_

 delayed the progress _meta_end_dot_

 as james thompson whom krauthammer praises recently explained t he political controversy set the field back four or five years second that delay is morally indefensible _meta_end_dot_

 as michael kinsley explained today every year that goes by science opens new doors and every year as you get older and your symptoms perhaps get worse doors get shut _meta_end_dot_

 six years of delay in a field moving as fast as stem cell research means a lot of people for whom doors may not open until it is time for them to shut third krauthammer applauds the fact that human embryos will now be left alone unless krauthammer is also prepared to ban in vitro fertilization which would show unusual intellectual consistency on his part that s clearly false _meta_end_dot_

 fourth and perhaps most importantly while the reported breakthroughs are encouraging to insist that the issue is now settled is at best premature _meta_end_dot_

 susan l _meta_end_dot_

 solomon the ceo of the new york stem cell foundation explained today that krauthammer simply doesn t know what he s talking about and is not even close to being right _meta_end_dot_

 what do you suppose the chances are that the wapo will run a correction detailing all of krauthammer s errors _meta_end_question_
