  the politico s roger simon has a new item that raises a depressing point that probably warrants some additional scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 the question of course is just how big that percentage is and whether it includes anyone who might otherwise be willing to vote for a democratic candidate _meta_end_dot_

 simon noted an ap poll from earlier this month that about _meta_number_ref_ percent of whites would be uncomfortable voting for a black for president that of course is a ridiculously large number of people who are willing to admit to a pollster that they judge people based on the color of their skin _meta_end_dot_

 it s compounded by the suspicion that there are plenty more who are also motivated by race but are too embarrassed to admit it out loud while participating in a poll _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum noted a month ago most people say they personally don t care if a presidential candidate is black or white _meta_end_dot_

 however since most people either don t want to think of themselves as racist or else don t want to admit it we might take that with a grain of salt _meta_end_dot_

 a more accurate accounting perhaps comes from what all these colorblind folks think about their friends _meta_end_dot_

 answer _meta_percent_ref_ say that most of the people they know wouldn t vote for a black candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this means that either a lot of americans are very cynical about their friends or else a lot of americans are stone racists it s little wonder then that republicans simply expect nearly one in seven voters to oppose obama in a general election should he win the democratic nomination simply on the basis of skin color _meta_end_dot_

 simon also pointed to this washington post item published yesterday it s the _meta_number_ref_st century for crying out loud _meta_end_dot_

 now my hope is that we re talking about lunatics who wouldn t vote for a democrat anyway and may not even be registered _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense knuckle draggers wouldn t necessarily be in a position to influence the election s outcome _meta_end_dot_

 i m also curious to see if the duration of the campaign has any effect _meta_end_dot_

 people who might have initially hesitated to support an african american candidate or for that matter a woman candidate have the chance to get over the identity questions and consider the issues and the people on their merits _meta_end_dot_

 in other words obama gets the chance to win people over by virtue of a lengthy process _meta_end_dot_

 but to think that _meta_percent_ref_ of the united states is more racist than rational more bigoted than decent is almost too painful to believe _meta_end_dot_
