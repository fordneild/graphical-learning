  offering his take on the winners and losers from yesterday s democratic debate in iowa the wapo s chris cillizza highlighted one clear and obvious loser keyes nonsense notwithstanding i thought the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it was perhaps the one real benefit to having the two presidential fields gather for debates on successive days we could not only measure candidates against the primary rivals we could measure the fields against one another _meta_end_dot_

 i m obviously not a neutral observer when it comes to ideology but i like to think i m objective enough to evaluate the quality of the two sets of presidential hopefuls _meta_end_dot_

 and by every measurement i can think of the democratic field is more serious more credible more knowledgeable more consistent more principled and more dignified _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the main reasons i ve been comfortable this year remaining neutral in the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 whenever someone asks me about my personal favorite i always say the same thing i don t have a strong preference but i m really impressed with the field i started saying that in february _meta_end_dot_

 these guys haven t given me reason to change my mind one bit _meta_end_dot_

 markos expressed a grudging preference for obama but more as a result of process of elimination _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum responded with an analysis i endorse enthusiastically _meta_end_dot_

 hear hear _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i d add that the democratic field is so strong second tier candidates like chris dodd and bill richardson and even once in a great while joe biden are credible candidates with terrific platforms _meta_end_dot_

 it s like having a sports team in which your bench is stronger than the other team s starters _meta_end_dot_

 the two iowa debates brought this point home so clearly it was painful _meta_end_dot_

 watching the gop field one could easily go man by man explaining why each republican a can t win the nomination and b should only be allowed in the white house on a public tour _meta_end_dot_

 watching the democratic field it was the same experience in reverse each demonstrated a depth of knowledge and commitment the republicans couldn t come close to matching _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really have a point here other than to say that as much as most dems have one favored candidate over another it s probably worth pausing from time to time to appreciate the strongest field of candidates either party has produced in the modern political era _meta_end_dot_
