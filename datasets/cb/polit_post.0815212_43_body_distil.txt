  guest post by morbo i am very weary of newspaper columnists who carp about why candidate x won t tell the american people the hard truth about issue y when they know full well any candidate who did that would see his or her political career end _meta_end_dot_

 these columns spring up like weeds during every presidential election year _meta_end_dot_

 a recent example is thomas friedman s wednesday column in the new york times implying that barack obama should give a tough speech about energy _meta_end_dot_

 friedman proposes that obama or some hypothetical candidate propose establishing a floor price for gas at _meta_dollor_ref_ per gallon _meta_end_dot_

 that is even if gas dropped below _meta_dollor_ref_ per gallon the government should impose taxes to keep the price there _meta_end_dot_

 the idea is that this would encourage production of more fuel efficient cars and hybrids _meta_end_dot_

 sure it would be amazing _meta_end_dot_

 it would also be political suicide _meta_end_dot_

 obama is under no obligation to take a step that would cut his own throat politically especially when he has the option of using other arguments and approaches to get us toward a sane energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 coming out as the candidate in favor of perpetually high gas prices is not the way to do that _meta_end_dot_

 a huge segment of the voting population embraces childlike magical thinking the gas fairy will come back and lower prices soon right _meta_end_question_

 deep down inside many probably know the gas fairy isn t coming back but they continue to hope _meta_end_dot_

 rather than gloat over the death of the gas fairy and hand a big soft target to the republicans obama and other democrats can work toward a rational energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot to be said for easing into it _meta_end_dot_

 this is a lot better than standing up and promising to take steps to make sure that gas always costs at least _meta_dollor_ref_ per gallon _meta_end_dot_

 in this climate any candidate who does that has consigned himself to the political graveyard _meta_end_dot_

 obviously candidates should steer clear of pandering _meta_end_dot_

 the john mccain hillary clinton gas tax vacation plan is pandering of the worse type _meta_end_dot_

 it should be avoided _meta_end_dot_

 but that does not mean a candidate is required to unveil proposals that are likely to be despised by the public and that leave him or her open to easy attacks from the opposition party _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy for friedman to insist that candidates should do this _meta_end_dot_

 comfortable in his sinecure at the times he s not running for anything _meta_end_dot_

 a column proposing an unpopular idea might lead to him getting a few nasty e mails _meta_end_dot_

 for obama it could mean losing the election and the opportunity to begin addressing in a less inflammatory way the issue friedman claims to care so much about _meta_end_dot_

 i am reminded of a candidate who once boldly told the american people that yes he would raise their taxes _meta_end_dot_

 he was right taxes did have to be raised and it was gutsy to say it during a televised debate _meta_end_dot_

 gutsy and foolish _meta_end_dot_

 people didn t want to hear it and you might recall that in november of _meta_number_ref_ walter mondale did not do very well _meta_end_dot_
