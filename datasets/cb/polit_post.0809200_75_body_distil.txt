  the pennsylvania primary is three weeks from tomorrow and the polls out of the state are still pretty one sided _meta_end_dot_

 so what are campaign watchers to do during the lull _meta_end_question_

 watch the superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 since this report ran on the wsj s front page this morning klobuchar announced her support for obama but the part about north carolina s entire house delegation backing obama is apparently premature _meta_end_dot_

 obama aides denied it while rep _meta_end_dot_

 g k _meta_end_dot_

 butterfield the only dem from the delegation to endorse said obama will gain support this week from the state s lawmakers and the number will be more than one but less than six nevertheless the general trend of superdelegates seems tilted in obama s direction _meta_end_dot_

 clinton recently picked up the support of jack murtha and in pennsylvania his name carries enormous weight but he appears to be more the exception than the rule _meta_end_dot_

 i hadn t actually thought much about that last point _meta_end_dot_

 i d assumed the superdelegates would want to wrap up the process sooner rather than later because it will help the party s chances of winning the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but the wsj piece is also right a drawn out nomination fight culminating in a convention fracas eight weeks before election day doesn t help the superdelegates in congress themselves _meta_end_dot_

 clearly hillary clinton intends to keep fighting apparently for the next five months _meta_end_dot_

 but watch these superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 a senator here and a house member there might not seem like much but they add up and if the superdelegates begin to break in large numbers the writing on the wall will be impossible to ignore _meta_end_dot_
