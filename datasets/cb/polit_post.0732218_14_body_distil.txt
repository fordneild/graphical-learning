  after the recent brouhaha over hillary clinton and some planted questions most political observers had to concede that the practice is hardly unusual at the presidential level _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign got caught and it was embarrassingly sloppy for the usually flawless operation but the reaction was muted thanks in part to the frequency with which this occurs _meta_end_dot_

 so frequent that another candidate has been caught _meta_end_question_

 the chicago tribune s jill zuckman speculates after john mccain s most recent event in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 reporters covering the event apparently laughed in response to the incessant softballs but a senior mccain aide swore that no one from the campaign asked any voter to ask any question or make any statement zuckman seemed skeptical which is perfectly understandable given the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t help but wonder maybe a lot of republican audiences are just naturally sycophantic _meta_end_question_
