  i ve long suspected that the right has greater success pushing culture war issues to the fore when real issues lack political salience _meta_end_dot_

 take the _meta_number_ref_s for example _meta_end_dot_

 during a period of peace and prosperity grassroots conservatives continued to push divisive trivia gay people are scary why won t the government do more to promote the ten commandments because most americans were content with the direction of the country the culture war became a subject of serious discussion because people didn t have as much to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne jr _meta_end_dot_

 makes the case today that in _meta_number_ref_ with all of the challenges we face no one really wants to hear the right whine about god guns and gays anymore _meta_end_dot_

 dionne s case is pretty persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the evidence to bolster his case is already apparent while dems are minimizing and seeking to heal cultural and religious rifts john mccain was able to secure the republican nomination despite opposition from the party s culture warrior base _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is a modern first _meta_end_dot_

 indeed while my distaste for mccain is fairly intense i feel relatively confident that he probably won t emphasize gay bashing and gun grabbing throughout the fall _meta_end_dot_

 but there s still one whopping caveat to all of this _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ cycle will still be plenty divisive it s just more likely to be divisive on different issues _meta_end_dot_

 it s not so much that the culture war is over but rather it s picking up new issues _meta_end_dot_

 the old ones became passe and for lack of a better word boring _meta_end_dot_

 the right still hopes to divide americans but with demagoguery for a new generation _meta_end_dot_

 falwell is dead robertson is laughed at and dobson is wondering why people aren t jumping to return his phone calls anymore _meta_end_dot_

 the activists that made these religious right leaders wealthy and powerful are still around and they re still asking the same old questions but now they have kids who want to know why climate change and poverty aren t considered moral questions too _meta_end_dot_

 and mainstream americans consider the recession iraq and healthcare and energy costs and suddenly find it a lot more difficult to get worked up over civil unions and ten commandments displays _meta_end_dot_

 what s more i d go so far as to say the religious activists themselves are exhausted _meta_end_dot_

 they worked tirelessly in _meta_number_ref_ to get exactly what they wanted a far right president working with a far right congress _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of legislative accomplishments what big ticket items got crossed off their to do list _meta_end_question_

 not a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 these folks will certainly keep voting and will definitely keeping backing republicans but i think even they ve learned that their legislative dreams aren t going to come to fruition _meta_end_dot_

 dionne concluded if dionne is right and i think he is the country will be better for it _meta_end_dot_
