  as recently as the summer rudy giuliani was leading the field in michigan s republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as early december a rasmussen poll showed him within two points of first place _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the former mayor finished a distant sixth with a pathetic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 consider this giuliani not only had well under half of ron paul s support he finished with a similar vote total to dennis kucinich who was running in an uncontested primary and making no effort to actually win votes _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 it naturally came as no surprise then when i saw this cnn headline romney win may give a boost to giuliani s white house bid yes it appears bad news is good news for rudy _meta_end_dot_

 yes of course right on track in iowa new hampshire and michigan giuliani was at one time the leading candidate and yet he nevertheless failed miserably in every contest _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is evidence giuliani and the media tell us of a campaign that is right where it wants to be _meta_end_dot_

 quite a bit of this very silly spin _meta_end_dot_

 ari fleischer proclaimed last night that the results in michigan were great news for rudy gloria borger a prominent media personality added that this is just the scenario he wants giuliani told fox news let s see giuliani went from first to sixth in iowa first to fourth in new hampshire and first to sixth in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 he s tanking in south carolina he s slipping in florida he s losing to mccain in new york and he s blown a _meta_number_ref_ point lead in new jersey where he s now polling in single digits _meta_end_dot_

 all the while his campaign has so little money that his senior aides aren t even going to get paid in january _meta_end_dot_

 this is a strategy giuliani and his team selected as if the master plan included a series of humiliating defeats _meta_end_dot_

 looking at this landscape the usually reasonable chris cillizza explained yesterday that giuliani is still very much in it look i understand the scenario _meta_end_dot_

 there s no obvious gop frontrunner which means all the half way coherent candidates in the field still have a shot _meta_end_dot_

 presumably that includes giuliani who might even manage to eke out a win in florida _meta_end_dot_

 it s been a strange year maybe there s some merit hiding somewhere in this strategy but i really doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 and seeing the media talk up giuliani s chances are constant and repeated failures is getting a little grating _meta_end_dot_
