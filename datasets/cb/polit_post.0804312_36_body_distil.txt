  by any reasonable measure today is a pretty important day in the democratic presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 generally called the chesapeake primary dems and independents will vote today in virginia maryland and the district of columbia _meta_end_dot_

 obama is considered the favorite in all three _meta_end_dot_

 but on the front page of the nyt today the story isn t about today s three contests it s about two contests three weeks away _meta_end_dot_

 alan patricof one of clinton s national finance chairmen added w e can t wait to get to march _meta_number_ref_ the meaning of the comment is almost literal today s travel schedule for clinton includes three stops not in any of today s contests or in any state that votes in february but rather in texas _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the firewall has already been identified and is in the process of being fortified _meta_end_dot_

 it s a strategy fraught with risk _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton loses every single contest between super tuesday and the end of february the campaign will in effect say those losses don t count we re focused on ohio and texas and if she wins any of those contests after lowering expectations it s a pleasant surprise and if all of this sounds kind of familiar to you it s because we ve seen a related strategy on the other side of the aisle rudy giuliani had blown leads in several of the early contests but consistently argued that those defeats were irrelevant because he was focused on florida _meta_end_dot_

 clinton appears to be attempting a similar approach to justifying a series of setbacks though there are important differences _meta_number_ref_ clinton will finish a competitive second in every february defeat while giuliani was losing to ron paul _meta_number_ref_ clinton may actually wins a february contest or two and _meta_number_ref_ clinton s firewall states may actually come through for her _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the broader strategy is at least similar _meta_end_dot_

 every time giuliani lost a state he said florida every time clinton loses in february she ll say texas and ohio it s all about minimizing the impact of defeats and focusing attention on the future because the present isn t going well _meta_end_dot_

 whether any of this can actually work of course remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_
