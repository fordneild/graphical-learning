  john mccain recently acknowledged the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should that s a perfectly accurate self assessment but the republican presidential hopeful is in a bit of a jam he hoped to ride into the white house merely by being wrong about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now that the economy is the top issue on voters minds mccain has no choice but to at least pretend like he cares about the issue and has a clue as to what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday then was a big day for the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the senator and his team rolled out a big speech fanned out over the airwaves and put the economy on the front burner _meta_end_dot_

 the result big mistake _meta_end_dot_

 first as for the not something i ve understood line fox news carl cameron asked the pertinent question the poor guy is just making things worse _meta_end_dot_

 for a while mccain flatly denied ever having made the remarks about his own ignorance at all _meta_end_dot_

 now mccain is saying his comments were taken out of context in reality both denials were wrong and dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has made the admission over and over again and not while hanging out with his reporter buddies on a bus _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain admitted he really didn t jump into economic issues as a lawmaker _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he acknowledged i m going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 i still need to be educated as recently as december mccain announced the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should just yesterday on fox news one of mccain s top advisers noted that he did say it one time no question maybe twice and as it turns out as ridiculous as this was as a defense for mccain s admitted ignorance the rest of the day s rollout on economic issues wasn t much better _meta_end_dot_

 both were lying _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign also said obama would nearly double capital gains taxes _meta_end_dot_

 this too is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign also said obama would raise the cap on social security taxes meaning a tax increase for millions of americans _meta_end_dot_

 this became problematic not because it s false but because mccain also has a record of being open to raising the income cap on social security taxes _meta_end_dot_

 and in my favorite example the mccain campaign relied on the classic tax fairy argument to insist that the government would collect more revenue if it cut taxes _meta_end_dot_

 this is not only demonstrably ridiculous but even the bush white house s own economic team has dismissed this as fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 great rollout of mccain s economic plan guys _meta_end_dot_

 quite an impressive show _meta_end_dot_
