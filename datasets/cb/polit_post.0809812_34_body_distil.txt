  the professional demise of mark penn hillary clinton s pollster and top campaign strategist has been predicted expected and demanded for several months now but to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 despite having lost the support of key clinton supporters and staffers despite questionable advice and tactics and despite fairly obvious conflicts of interest penn maintained the confidence of the one person who mattered the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it took longer than expected but lobbying to pass a colombian trade deal that clinton opposes turned out to be the one controversy penn couldn t spin out of _meta_end_dot_

 a day after the colombian government fired penn clinton decided to make a change too _meta_end_dot_

 that last point is of particular interest in that there s some question as to whether penn jumped or was pushed _meta_end_dot_

 all evidence points to the latter _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a situation in which clinton detractors celebrate her campaign s internal disarray while clinton supporters dismiss the shake up as trivia _meta_end_dot_

 if anything it s largely the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 improved morale at campaign headquarters _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj talked to one clinton advisor last night who recalled that the team was saddened by the departure of patti solis doyle the senator s former campaign manager who was forced out several weeks ago but penn s demotion was welcome news _meta_end_dot_

 t here won t be a tear shed here i can assure you the advisor said _meta_end_dot_

 the word demotion is also of interest since it appears that penn wasn t actually fired he ll still reportedly be responsible for doing polling work for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it s not at all clear how this is going to work nor is it likely to mollify influential labor groups who don t want penn to be associated with the clinton campaign at all _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s a major development for the clinton team and raises a few questions will penn still linger in the background quietly feeding advice to the clintons or has he really stepped aside _meta_end_question_

 will the campaign now try to shift to messages and themes that haven t been shaped by penn _meta_end_question_

 is penn s demotion too late to really help _meta_end_question_

 two days before the ohio and texas primaries penn tried to argue that he had no real authority in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 how quickly will he make the same argument again _meta_end_question_

 will any major presidential campaign ever again make the mistake of putting one person in charge of strategy and polling _meta_end_question_

 the conflict is absurd penn crafted a plan and then provided his own data to show how right he was how soon will penn actually collect the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million the campaign still owes him _meta_end_question_

 inquiring minds want to know _meta_end_dot_
