  last week jonathan martin noted that it seemed as if barack obama and john mccain were itching to take each other on directly they just can t wait to go at it quite right _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that mccain and his team enjoy the benefits that come with a prolonged democratic nomination fight but they also don t want to spend the next five months waiting on the sidelines while the clinton obama show dominates the political world s attention _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind we saw a hint yesterday of a what a general election campaign might look at least with regard to the debate over iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 this is the way it s supposed to be _meta_end_dot_

 and the obama campaign fires right back _meta_end_dot_

 obama is inexperienced while mccain is misguided _meta_end_dot_

 there s a good reason the democrats want to have this debate in the fall it s eminently winnable _meta_end_dot_

 as for broader context i think we can glean a few tidbits from all of this _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain is very sensitive about the whole _meta_number_ref_ years line which suggests dems might want to keep emphasizing it _meta_end_dot_

 second i m encouraged by the fact that the obama campaign isn t backing down when it comes to national security and or foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is used to getting a free ride the sooner it ends the better _meta_end_dot_

 and third it seems the best way for hillary clinton to engage at this point is to go after mccain too _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday her campaign seemed largely focused on process criticizing calls for her withdrawal and pushing for progress on michigan s and florida s convention delegates _meta_end_dot_

 this probably isn t what the campaign wants right now stories about mccain and obama debating iraq policy while clinton is addressing the nomination fight _meta_end_dot_

 the more clinton goes after mccain the more mccain will have to respond and the more that will generate attention for her campaign _meta_end_dot_
