  reasonable democrats can disagree about the merit of hillary clinton s negative campaigning over the last few months _meta_end_dot_

 clinton supporters argue that the attacks against barack obama have been fair and accurate and if he can t overcome the harsh criticism now he ll wither against the gop in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters argue of course that the attacks have been counter productive inaccurate and eerily similar to rhetoric coming from the right _meta_end_dot_

 what seems far less debatable is the reality of the negative dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 clinton campaign staffers were themselves referring to the attack plan as far back as february as the kitchen sink strategy some party leaders referred to the tonya harding option putting aside whether the attacks are fair warranted or effective they exist _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in some ways they re a selling point the clinton campaign has subtly argued we re hitting obama hard now but we ll hit mccain even harder later given this i was confused by this washington post piece from doug schoen bill clinton s former pollster and a former partner of mark penn _meta_end_dot_

 as schoen sees it clinton s problem is that she s refused to go negative _meta_end_dot_

 if schoen wanted to argue that clinton needs to be even more negative i d understand his point _meta_end_dot_

 i think he d be wrong but the argument is not on its face foolish _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton needs to completely abandon her positive campaign _meta_end_question_

 she s shown determination to use a positive message until the democratic convention _meta_end_question_

 i don t imagine even clinton s most enthusiastic fans would agree with this _meta_end_dot_

 fascinating item on mccain in the new issue of new york magazine and he spoke with one leading republican party official about how the gop would go after obama in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 our strategy will look a fair amount like the one that hillary is running against him now the official said _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton were running an exclusively positive campaign somehow i doubt republican officials would make a comment like this _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure going negative can work _meta_end_dot_

 before the march _meta_number_ref_ contests last month obama was closing the gap quickly clinton went aggressively negative and stopped his momentum _meta_end_dot_

 she won ohio and texas despite being outspent _meta_end_dot_

 but schoen seems to believe that this simply didn t happen which is just odd _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly schoen brushes past the consequences of the attacks we ve already seen _meta_end_dot_

 a more relentlessly negative style would likely make these results even worse _meta_end_dot_

 now schoen may believe clinton doesn t have any other choice and he may very well be right _meta_end_dot_

 but for him to argue that clinton hasn t gone negative in recent months casts doubt on the rest of his thesis _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall was slightly less charitable but seriously what is schoen smoking
