  in july in one of the lower points for presidential campaign coverage the washington post s fashion writer robin givhan wrote an odd _meta_number_ref_ word piece about an outfit hillary clinton wore on the senate floor showing a very modest amount of cleavage _meta_end_dot_

 with clinton there was the sense that you were catching a surreptitious glimpse at something private givhan wrote _meta_end_dot_

 you were intruding being a voyeur _meta_end_dot_

 showing cleavage is a request to be engaged in a particular way it was an unusually silly article about a presidential candidate in one of the nation s most important daily newspapers and it deserved all the ridicule it received _meta_end_dot_

 today as michael froomkin noted givhan was at it again with a piece titled wearing the pants envisioning a female commander in chief it is you guessed it an entire piece in the a section devoted to the senator s pantsuits _meta_end_dot_

 now i try not to be a purist when it comes to articles about political trivia _meta_end_dot_

 presidential campaigns are bound to include some coverage of the candidate s personalities families interests etc _meta_end_dot_

 voters care about some of these details when evaluating presidential hopefuls so it s probably not realistic to expect major media outlets to be all policy all the time _meta_end_dot_

 having said that this piece about clinton s pantsuits is more than just silly it s demeaning _meta_end_dot_

 political analysis and worse yet psychoanalysis of candidates for national office based on preferences for colors and fabric _meta_end_dot_

 oh my _meta_end_dot_
