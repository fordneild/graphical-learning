  abc news reported this week that a group of so called principals including vice president dick cheney defense secretary donald rumsfeld secretary of state colin powell cia director george tenet attorney general john ashcroft and national security advisor condoleezza rice met dozens of times in the white house to discuss and approve specific interrogation techniques to be used against suspected terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 the ap added to the revelations yesterday noting among other things that cheney _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 took care to insulate president bush from a series of meetings where cia interrogation methods including waterboarding which simulates drowning were discussed and ultimately approved yesterday perhaps anxious to dispel the notion that he was out of the loop the president said arguably bragged that he endorsed the principals work from the outset _meta_end_dot_

 when faced with more than seven years of scandals and outrages of various shapes and sizes it s easy to get inured to low expectations _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s difficult not to get hardened _meta_end_dot_

 but that s all the more reason to pause to consider just what the president was conceding yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 digby s take was spot on curiously the president s concession to abc seems to be of only mild interest this morning _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo had an item on page a_meta_number_ref_ but the nyt didn t mention the remarks and there s no ap story _meta_end_dot_

 even abc news itself is downplaying the significance of its own story on its website the main story is the debate over whether obama is right about working class families bitterness followed by an item about hillary telling bill to stop talking about bosnia _meta_end_dot_

 the lead video on abc news site isn t the bush interview it s dumb robber leaves resume then there s a story about the president endorsing his team s torture efforts _meta_end_dot_

 somehow it seems like this story deserves a little more attention _meta_end_dot_
