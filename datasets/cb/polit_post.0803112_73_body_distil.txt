  after skipping a couple of republican presidential candidate debates lately i thought it was time to get back in the game _meta_end_dot_

 after all the field is down to just four candidates which led me to believe that last night s event at the reagan library in california might be a little more substantive than most _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it also seemed likely to be more lively given that for the first time in a year there s an obvious frontrunner who seemed like an obvious target _meta_end_dot_

 alas i was quickly reminded as to why i gave up on watching these things in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 there was one exchange that was particularly heated and which will probably draw the most media attention today _meta_end_dot_

 the lat s janet hook asked obviously iraq is still a major issue in this campaign and over the last few days there s been a real back and forth going on here _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain has said over and over again that you supported a timetable for phased withdrawal from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 is that true romney responded mccain responded and from there we were treated to a back and forth squabble that seemed to last for hours _meta_end_dot_

 how bad was it _meta_end_question_

 it took ron paul to help make sense of the bickering _meta_end_dot_

 paul received more applause than he s heard at a gop debate in quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is the endless squabble over whether romney backed timetables for withdrawal in april _meta_number_ref_ objectively he did not didn t do either candidate any favors _meta_end_dot_

 for his part mccain was lying and it was pretty obvious _meta_end_dot_

 as for romney the underlying point that romney was not enthusiastic in support for the bush policy in iraq is fair and he was trying to weasel out of it _meta_end_dot_

 worse by spending what seemed like forever bickering over a one sentence comment from april about iraq romney wasn t able to talk about the economy which is safer ground for him _meta_end_dot_

 as for the bigger picture since there were only four candidates on the stage let s go one at a time mccain the frontrunner appeared tired and a little confused at times _meta_end_dot_

 worse he was intentionally deceptive more than once on the timetables thing and when he told the audience that he voted twice to make bush s tax cuts permanent _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain had a strategy last night it was hiding well _meta_end_dot_

 slate s chadwick matlin wrote as my trailhead colleague mr _meta_end_dot_

 beam pointed out he s the senile grandfather you let prattle on because it s too sad to tell him to shut up will any of this change the dynamics of the race overall _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 romney he s actually become a pretty good debater but his goal for the night was to score some points at mccain s expense _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t see that happening last night _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i saw more of romney trying to be too slick for his own good such as refusal to answer a question about whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 is better off now than it was eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee huck clearly has the best rhetorical skills of the gop field but he got screwed last night with very few questions and at times one forgot that he was even on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 i did notice though that at one point in the debate huckabee said you can t have a president who sees a whole bunch of america as invisible isn t that almost the exact same line that hillary clinton used in her iowa ads _meta_end_question_

 paul at one point early on after some discussion between the other candidates paul said i would like to take one minute since i didn t get a chance to answer this discussion on conservative versus liberal at which point anderson cooper cut him off _meta_end_dot_

 i promise you we re going to have a you re going to have another opportunity to do that i promise you coming up in like two minutes or two questions cooper said _meta_end_dot_

 he broke his promise and paul wasn t heard from again for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 paul for his many faults at least kept some of the other debates interesting with an untraditional perspective _meta_end_dot_

 last night cnn ignored him altogether _meta_end_dot_

 so what did you think _meta_end_question_
