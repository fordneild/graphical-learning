  yesterday leading mccain campaign surrogate carly fiorina a top advisor to the republican candidate insisted that barack obama s plan to raise taxes on those who make more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year would hurt small businesses _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been hearing this quite a bit lately _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago after the obama campaign issued its first general election ad emphasizing that obama had been taught values straight from the kansas heartland the mccain campaign in an odd non sequitur responded barack obama wants more taxes from _meta_number_ref_ million small businesses and the week before that mccain delivered a speech to the national small business summit arguing senator obama s plans would add to the difficulties of small business in other ways too _meta_end_dot_

 currently there are the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million sole proprietorships filing under the individual income tax _meta_end_dot_

 when senator obama talks about raising income tax rates on those making over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dollars that includes these businesses as well both the hill and bloomberg news passed along mccain s claim as if it were true _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s demonstrably false and like far too many of the mccain campaign s talking points has been debunked repeatedly _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as the mccain campaign is going to keep repeating blatant untruths we might as well go to the trouble of explaining why _meta_end_dot_

 meet reality _meta_end_dot_

 to her credit jay newton small fleshed this out in even more detail _meta_end_dot_

 ok so mccain his aides and his surrogates have been clearly getting this wrong _meta_end_dot_

 either they re repeating bogus talking points without knowing what they re talking about or they re deliberately lying _meta_end_dot_

 which one is it _meta_end_question_

 apparently it s the latter _meta_end_dot_

 we know this because time asked fiorina to explain how she arrived at the _meta_number_ref_ million figure _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain advisor surrogate responded so confronted with reality the mccain campaign digs in to lie some more _meta_end_dot_

 or as newton small concluded this statement while factually true is terribly misleading since only a small percentage of the _meta_number_ref_ million small businesses would actually see tax increases and the obama campaign argues that under his administration small businesses would benefit from his universal healthcare plan offsetting any tax increases the top tier earners might see _meta_end_dot_

 so when running hp did _meta_number_ref_ million a few hundred thousand _meta_end_question_

 no wonder she got fired for that matter let s also not forget that for the mccain campaign it was part of a day filled with obvious and transparent falsehoods on economic matters _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that honorable campaign mccain had promised us _meta_end_dot_
