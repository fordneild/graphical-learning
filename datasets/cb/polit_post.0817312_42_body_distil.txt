  first amendment law is pretty unambiguous about where the church state line in drawn in public school classrooms which is why it s disappointing to hear about teachers who continue to impose their religious beliefs onto students _meta_end_dot_

 but while there s no shortage of incidents involving teachers promoting creationism i don t think i ve ever heard of a controversy like this one out of ohio _meta_end_dot_

 so far so routine _meta_end_dot_

 a teacher rejected modern science ignored the school s curriculum and standards and screwed over his students _meta_end_dot_

 freshwater was told to stick to the lesson plan but refused _meta_end_dot_

 but when consultants were called in to investigate this teacher s work they also found that freshwater burned crosses onto students arms using an electrostatic device seriously _meta_end_dot_

 it s not altogether clear why freshwater would be burning xs into students arms anyway but the columbus dispatch report includes a photo and that s a cross _meta_end_dot_

 the family of one of the branded students filed a lawsuit last week against freshwater and the district saying the student s civil rights were violated _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the clincher with the exception of the cross burning episode _meta_end_question_

 look if the report about freshwater s classroom antics is accurate he generally sounds like just another fundamentalist with no business leading a science classroom _meta_end_dot_

 he ignored the curriculum on modern biology he kept a bible on his desk at all times and he labeled homosexuality a sin _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is legally problematic but guys like freshwater are a dime a dozen _meta_end_dot_

 but once a teacher starts getting into branding students in the classroom with crosses it s a little tougher to just dismiss his behavior as routine _meta_end_dot_
