  headline i wish i d come up with from the nyt s timothy egan goodbye rudy tuesday hmm where have i seen that trend before _meta_end_question_

 oh right everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 we know from a certain new hampshire contest that pre primary polls aren t always reliable but all available evidence suggests giuliani who came up with a post hoc florida rationale for failing badly everywhere else is tanking in his designated firewall state _meta_end_dot_

 but if the former mayor isn t going to win in florida who is _meta_end_question_

 one florida pollster said giuliani for all intents and purposes has virtually no chance to win in florida how bad is it _meta_end_question_

 i saw some analyses yesterday that giuliani was missing valuable opportunities by not attacking his rivals in florida nearly enough _meta_end_dot_

 apparently though that s intentional giuliani may expect to lose and figures staying positive now may help his post candidate business career _meta_end_dot_

 obviously strange things happen and i m reluctant to label any candidate toast prematurely but i m feeling quite a bit of relief lately over giuliani s collapse _meta_end_dot_

 all of the republican presidential candidates to varying degrees strike me as awful but a giuliani presidency would have been a nightmare _meta_end_dot_
