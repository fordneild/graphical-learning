  late last week mark demoss arguably the most prominent public relations executive in the evangelical world raised a few eyebrows when he told beliefnet that many evangelicals have a fascination with barack obama demoss concluded i will not be surprised if he gets one third of the evangelical vote _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t be surprised if it was _meta_number_ref_ percent and what about the republican nominee _meta_end_question_

 beliefnet asked how is john mccain doing among evangelicals a crucial republican constituency demoss said from his perspective no one in the evangelical community is really talking about mccain at all _meta_end_dot_

 following up it appears some evangelicals are talking about mccain but the campaign probably wouldn t care for what they re saying _meta_end_dot_

 bob novak wrote in his latest column about mccain s evangelical problem as evidenced by mccain s estranged relationship with james dobson and the campaign s clumsy handling of the john hagee blunder _meta_end_dot_

 and the nyt notes today just how challenging it is to resolve this problem _meta_end_dot_

 so is the outreach working _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 latest numbers are striking _meta_end_dot_

 how can this be _meta_end_question_

 for one thing mccain s outreach is half hearted in part because he s afraid of alienating the middle while he pursues the right _meta_end_dot_

 for another conservatives have noticed _meta_end_dot_

 the record is getting pretty long _meta_end_dot_

 mccain denounced the religious right agents of intolerance eight years ago and bungled the hagee and rod parsley fiascos _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t even talk about how when and whether he switched from being an episcopalian to a baptist without sounding completely incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 the times piece added that mccain s advisers say they re in a listening mode with evangelical leaders i get the sense the advisers will get an earful _meta_end_dot_
