  mike huckabee was taking a bit of a chance appearing on meet the press with just a few days left before the iowa caucuses an unimpressive showing would have created quite a bit of negative media buzz in the closing days but the former governor didn t make any errors that were so serious they re likely to hurt his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that said he made several noteworthy comments _meta_end_dot_

 for example there was this odd exchange on huckabee s opinions on homosexuality _meta_end_dot_

 tp has the video i see _meta_end_dot_

 so huckabee doesn t actually care if someone is gay he cares whether or not gays are celibate _meta_end_dot_

 tendencies don t matter to huckabee whether gays act on those tendencies is what counts _meta_end_dot_

 and here i thought his years of bizarre criticism of the gay community were a sign of intolerance _meta_end_dot_

 i ve clearly misjudged him _meta_end_dot_

 russert also quizzed huckabee on his stated desire to take the nation back for christ i haven t the foggiest idea what that means _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said he hopes people take the united states back for christ what difference does it make who his audience was _meta_end_question_

 either he wants to lead the country in an officially explicitly christian direction or he doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 why would it be appropriate for him to make this proclamation in front of one audience and not another _meta_end_question_

 maybe a huckabee supporter might say none of this really matters because he s vowed not to let his faith dictate government policy _meta_end_dot_

 that s true he has offered that assurance _meta_end_dot_

 but there s that gubernatorial record of his that occasionally gets in the way of his campaign promises _meta_end_dot_

 now to be fair it s worth noting that there s no indication that huckabee s decision to delay the bill adversely affected anyone _meta_end_dot_

 but the state legislation in question sought to protect tornado victims from insurance companies that might cancel their policies and used language acts of god which is standard in many insurance policies _meta_end_dot_

 one state senator noted instead of getting focused on getting aid to the areas he s in an uproar over words _meta_end_dot_

 it was kind of silly huckabee told russert yesterday that the best way to consider whether he would blend faith and public policy is to look at how i served as a governor that s hardly reassuring _meta_end_dot_
