  we learned two weeks ago that an american company is moving forward with a half billion dollar project the baghdad zoo and entertainment experience a massive american style amusement park that will feature a skateboard park rides a concert theatre and a museum _meta_end_dot_

 it is being designed by the firm that developed disneyland baghdad s entertainment experience will reportedly occupy no pun intended _meta_number_ref_ acres in the heart of downtown adjacent to the green zone _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan stein raised the point on the minds of many sure _meta_end_dot_

 a massive disneyland style amusement park operated for american profit plunked in the middle of baghdad that won t be a target for hostilities _meta_end_dot_

 not at all as it turns out other developers are willing to bet on a baghdad rebound as well _meta_end_dot_

 a navy captain who led the team that created the development plan said a deal for a new marriot has already been completed _meta_end_dot_

 there are a couple of concerns associated with these plans _meta_end_dot_

 ok more than a couple _meta_end_dot_

 but in the interim even the possibility has driven real estate prices through the roof _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i m sure locals are thrilled about baghdad property they can no longer afford _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter developers have some logistical problems to consider such as the absence of any kind of local infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like it might be tough to build a marriot under those circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 and then of course there s the question of how actual iraqis in baghdad might feel about western style hotels condos and shopping coming in and taking over their downtown _meta_end_dot_

 given that there s already a wee bit of resentment towards the u s _meta_end_dot_

 now i can t help but wonder if this might make matters considerably worse _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i m not even sure why the pentagon is involved with this in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 if the defense department is going to take on economic development projects should basic utilities be higher on the list than this _meta_end_question_

 spencer ackerman concluded that iraqis experience shortages of water electricity fuel cooking oil medical care security and more _meta_end_dot_

 the rise of this hotel compound will drain resources away from a desperate population what could possibly go wrong _meta_end_question_
