  after writing five posts in five days on the increasingly ridiculous debate over a gas tax holiday i was prepared to let the subject go _meta_end_dot_

 really i was _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt had an interesting item about the role of the gas tax idea within the broader context of clinton s and obama s economic perspectives but i read it thinking must avoid topic but this morning hillary clinton effectively taunted me into yet another post _meta_end_dot_

 it s really not my fault it s hers _meta_end_dot_

 that banging sound you hear is me hitting my head against my desk _meta_end_dot_

 first stephanopoulos question was pretty reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 the huffington post spent most of thursday trying to find a single economist left right center dem republican even former clinton administration officials who could defend clinton s idea _meta_end_dot_

 zero turned up _meta_end_dot_

 literally not one _meta_end_dot_

 that should give us a hint about the merit of the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 second clinton s disgust for elite opinion is not only entirely out of character for her it s a textbook george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush move _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no excuse for any democrat especially one as sharp and knowledgeable as clinton to do this _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the fact that clinton can make these remarks with a straight face is rather disconcerting _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has been citing these experts for years _meta_end_dot_

 elite opinion hasn t been behind policies that haven t worked well for hard working americans elite opinion has been pushing in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 bush hasn t been operating with the support of policy experts he s been blowing off policy experts as liberal eggheads who think too much _meta_end_dot_

 and now clinton appears ready to join him _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect by the end of the week clinton will be railing against the man who s always trying to keep us down consider an example _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt s paul krugman is one of the most influential liberal thinkers in the country _meta_end_dot_

 he s also been a pretty reliable ally of hillary clinton during the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 on this issue though krugman has already explained how wrong clinton is _meta_end_dot_

 is it clinton s position that paul krugman is against policies that benefit most americans _meta_end_question_

 is she now arguing that krugman has stood behind policies that don t work for hard working americans _meta_end_question_

 if clinton s anti intellectual anti expertise rhetoric sounds familiar it s because we ve been listening to the bush gang rail against elites in the exact same way for the last eight years _meta_end_dot_

 the irony is clinton is at her best her most impressive and most inspiring when she s showing off the depth of her knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonk clinton is absolutely amazing she knows details and policy minutiae better than almost anyone on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonk clinton loves studies evidence and reason _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonk clinton is a bit like al gore only with better political instincts and shrewder campaign skills _meta_end_dot_

 she s the type of candidate i can really get excited about _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonk clinton however has left the building and has been replaced with shameless pandering clinton who sounds like bush while promoting john mccain s gas tax ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner we can get the real clinton back the better _meta_end_dot_
