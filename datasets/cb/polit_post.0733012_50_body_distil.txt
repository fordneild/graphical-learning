  there have been rumors about senate minority whip trent lott s r miss future plans but this news will almost certainly catch the political world off guard _meta_end_dot_

 lott was just re elected to another term a year ago so he wouldn t have to face any kind of challenge until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even then most would agree that lott s is one of the safest seats in the chamber _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s a bizarre time for lott to end his career _meta_end_dot_

 after a humiliating fall from grace in _meta_number_ref_ lott had mounted a slow but steady comeback _meta_end_dot_

 he d finally rejoined the senate republican leadership elected as the minority whip earlier this year _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter as of a few months ago he d raised about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million for his leadership political action committee which senators on the verge of resignation rarely do _meta_end_dot_

 there really haven t been any hints of this announcement at all _meta_end_dot_

 far from preparing an exit lott has been acting like someone more engaged in the political process than ever even hosting a meeting last month with a handful of the senate s most notable compromisers to figure out how to unclog the gridlock that has slowed the chamber s progress this year and yet a month later lott is not only prepared to retire but poised to give up his seat five years ahead of schedule _meta_end_question_

 we ll probably hear something about spending more time with his family but there s something odd about this story _meta_end_dot_

 helpful details about possible successors _meta_end_dot_

 moore would definitely be a credible senate candidate giving dems a possible pick up opportunity exactly what republicans don t want to hear right now _meta_end_dot_

 in fact lott s departure would make him the sixth republican senator to step down this cycle making a difficult landscape all the more challenging and reviving democratic hopes of possibly reaching a _meta_number_ref_ vote filibuster proof majority _meta_end_dot_

 as for today the ap reports that lott has scheduled two news conferences in mississippi today _meta_end_dot_

 according to congressional sources lott s resignation is not due to health problems but simply that the senator has other opportunities he plans to pursue _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
