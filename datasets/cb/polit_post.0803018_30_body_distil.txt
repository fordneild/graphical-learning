  a few months ago there was a spate of retirement announcements among house republicans but it wasn t too big a deal _meta_end_dot_

 the announcements were a little early but the numbers were in line with normal turnover that happens in practically every cycle _meta_end_dot_

 but what started as a modest trend is starting to look like an exodus _meta_end_dot_

 at this point house republican incumbents are fleeing from the house as if it were on fire _meta_end_dot_

 the latest is rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom davis r va davis retirement announcement comes just one day after rep _meta_end_dot_

 ron lewis r ken said that he too is stepping down _meta_end_dot_

 and lewis announcement came just one day after rep _meta_end_dot_

 kenny hulshof r mo said he would also give up his seat this year _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 dave weldon r fla announced his retirement and this came just a day after rep _meta_end_dot_

 jim walsh r n y said he too is stepping down _meta_end_dot_

 in all there are now _meta_number_ref_ house republicans who will not seek re election about _meta_percent_ref_ of the house gop caucus including five retirement announcements in five days _meta_end_dot_

 one almost gets the sense that republican lawmakers a aren t fond of being in the minority and b aren t confident that _meta_number_ref_ will be a gop year _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t have happened to a more appropriate group of guys _meta_end_dot_
