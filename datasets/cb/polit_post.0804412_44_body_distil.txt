  it doesn t get mentioned nearly enough but one of the factors that may help the democrats this fall is that john mccain when he talks about iraq policy tends to fly off the handle and say things that don t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 here he is on monday campaigning in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who can t watch videos online the clip shows mccain responding to a question about his willingness to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who worries about how long we re in iraq does not understand the military and does not understand war said mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he added that it is really almost insulting to one s intelligence to question how long we re in iraq because he believes the current strategy is succeeding now it s worth noting that when it comes to iraq john mccain has been hopelessly almost comically confused for many years now _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he d prefer to forget about it now but his pre war predictions look ridiculous in retrospect _meta_end_dot_

 he claims to have rejected the white house policy years ago but he was actually a cheerleader for the bush rumsfeld strategy repeatedly emphasizing the need to stay the course all of his assurances about the benchmarks of the surge have proven false _meta_end_dot_

 what s more about a year ago mccain insisted that parts of baghdad are safe for americans to go for a stroll and that general petraeus travels around the city almost every day in a non armed humvee claims that senior military officials on the ground found literally laughable _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter he went to a baghdad market surrounded himself with _meta_number_ref_ soldiers three blackhawk helicopters and two apache gunships and then told reporters that was able to walk freely in iraq s capital _meta_end_dot_

 and yet now he wants to lecture others about who really understands iraq _meta_end_dot_

 matt yglesias take was particularly spot on as for mccain s assertion that it s insulting to care about the duration of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 occupation the senator seems to be inadvertently insulting senior military leaders _meta_end_dot_

 as the campaign moves forward over the next several months watch for these gaffes to pile up _meta_end_dot_

 mccain just can t help himself _meta_end_dot_
