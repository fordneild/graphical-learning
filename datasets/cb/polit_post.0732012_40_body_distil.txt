  at _meta_number_ref_pm last night the debate in las vegas was supposed to begin but cnn s wolf blitzer was the only person on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this was intentional cnn wanted to show the audience what a photo op looks like blitzer after introducing the candidates one at a time told the audience we thought you know what _meta_end_question_

 we re going to bring that to you as well tonight why _meta_end_question_

 because it presumably makes better television than the actual debate _meta_end_question_

 later when members of the audience got a chance to ask question we saw this gem got that _meta_end_question_

 a smart voter asked a smart question _meta_end_dot_

 as someone who cares a lot about the supreme court i was genuinely curious to hear the candidates responses _meta_end_dot_

 but cnn s suzanne malveaux decided the voter s question wasn t quite good enough so she decided to fix it twisting it into a more conventional question about litmus tests _meta_end_dot_

 after dodd answered the question blitzer added insult to injury all right let s go through the whole panel _meta_end_dot_

 i want everybody to weigh in _meta_end_dot_

 this is an important question that was raised _meta_end_dot_

 i ll start with senator biden _meta_end_dot_

 would you insist that any nominee for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court supported abortion rights for women in other words according to blitzer the important question that was raised wasn t the one from the undecided voter it was the one from suzanne malveaux who changed the important question from the undecided voter _meta_end_dot_

 these insufferable debates can be difficult enough to endure _meta_end_dot_

 cnn seemed anxious to make the event akin to root canal surgery _meta_end_dot_

 pushing the candidates into political controversies _meta_end_dot_

 actually informing the public was an afterthought _meta_end_dot_

 a few times the candidates most notably biden and obama pushed back against blitzer s annoying habits but not enough _meta_end_dot_

 i d have been tempted to endorse the candidate who said wolf just shut up post script as oliver willis noted the post debate wrap up was just as bad _meta_end_dot_

 there has to be a better way of covering a political event _meta_end_dot_
