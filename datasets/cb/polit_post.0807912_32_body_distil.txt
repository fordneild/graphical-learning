  at first blush it sounds pretty silly _meta_end_dot_

 realistically it seems foolish to think there are voters in florida who think i prefer democrats to john mccain on iraq the economy the environment and taxes but i m not going to vote for them in november because of a dispute over convention delegates sure people can base their votes on superficial reasons but c mon _meta_end_dot_

 no one is that foolish are they _meta_end_question_

 well it s a funny story _meta_end_dot_

 specifically poll respondents were asked if florida s delegates are not counted are you any less likely to support the democratic candidate for president two thirds said this would not affect their vote but _meta_percent_ref_ of florida dems said they are much less likely to support the dems ticket in november while _meta_percent_ref_ said they are somewhat less likely it s worth taking a moment to consider how truly ridiculous this is _meta_end_dot_

 michael crowley argued that this shouldn t concern the democratic party at all because there s no way voters would actually do this _meta_end_dot_

 i want to believe this i really do _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to believe voters would put the nation s interests and their own interests far above petty concerns about nominating calendars and convention delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but if this poll is any indication there s at least some chance that this dispute could cost the party one of the biggest and most competitive states in the country _meta_end_dot_

 the saving grace may prove to be time _meta_end_dot_

 when the election rolls around in november the convention will have been three months past and the rule breaking primary will have been _meta_number_ref_ months past _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what s going to happen with those delegates but dems can at least hope that the wound will heal by election day _meta_end_dot_
