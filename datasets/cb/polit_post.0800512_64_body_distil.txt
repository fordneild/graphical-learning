  because of the compressed calendar there are just five short days between the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary which poses a challenge for hillary clinton s and john edwards campaigns how to blunt barack obama s post iowa momentum quickly _meta_end_dot_

 tom edsall offers a look at the chosen avenues of attack _meta_end_dot_

 just as i go to the trouble of defending the clinton campaign from charges of triangulation it turns around and starts blasting liberal voting records worse according to time s karen tumulty a clinton media advisor said voters would soon see some very sharp ads from the senator s campaign which may include criticizing obama for being liberal on gun control _meta_end_dot_

 there s been quite a bit of discussion in recent weeks about whether obama has been relying on conservative frames to get ahead _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton is going to take on obama from the right that discussion is going to shift in a hurry _meta_end_dot_

 given what we know this sounds like something for obama to brag about not something for clinton to use as a cudgel _meta_end_dot_

 and obama thinks mandatory minimum are a mistake _meta_end_question_

 they are a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 this makes me like obama more not less _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly enough we then have edwards new tack _meta_end_dot_

 hmm clinton is poised to hammer obama for being a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is already hammering obama for not being liberal enough _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i have a hunch the obama campaign finds all of this pretty helpful _meta_end_dot_
