  when it comes to the nominating process nothing is ever straightforward _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush yesterday s results of the democratic caucus in nevada weren t complicated at all hillary clinton enjoyed a modest victory over barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 she won he lost and then they re off to south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 no muss no fuss _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s the delegate question to consider _meta_end_dot_

 here was the news as of late afternoon yesterday and sure enough by _meta_number_ref_ pm eastern both ap and nbc changed their delegate counts to reflect _meta_number_ref_ for obama and _meta_number_ref_ for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign immediately started referring to the nevada results as a shared victory could clinton have won the state while losing the delegates _meta_end_question_

 based on the bizarre rules it s possible but complicated _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is neither clinton nor obama won any nevada delegates yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith helps translate just for good measure last night the obama campaign was needling the clinton camp by circulating a recent quote from howard wolfson who said this is a race for delegates it is not a battle for individual states _meta_end_dot_

 as david knows we are well past the time when any state will have a disproportionate influence on the nominating process for more on the delegate count chris hayes and ari melber who help make sense of what is obviously a very silly process _meta_end_dot_
