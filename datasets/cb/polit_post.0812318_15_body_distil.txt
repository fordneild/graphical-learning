  it s obviously just a conversation piece meant for water cooler fodder but it s friday afternoon and i kind of like mulling over conversation pieces like these _meta_end_dot_

 london s telegraph likes to run occasional lists about american politics _meta_end_dot_

 it s latest installment counts down the most influential political pundits in the country _meta_end_dot_

 an added goal the telegraph said was to reward those with the most potential to influence events over the coming months rather than simply the stalwarts of past years _meta_end_dot_

 while being opinionated did not guarantee consideration having strong opinions was a key factor _meta_end_dot_

 many important journalists have been left out because they portray themselves as objective and seek to inform rather than persuade now that i ve seen who made the list and who didn t i m left with a few questions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mark halperin the political analyst for time and a ubiquitous television presence _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 david brooks the nyt columnist and a ubiquitous television presence _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 jon stewart host of the daily show _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert host of meet the press and dc bureau chief of nbc news _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 matt drudge proprietor of the drudge report _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john harris and jim vandehei founders of politico com _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh radio talk show host _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 sean hannity fox news host and radio talk show host _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 chris matthews host of hardball and the chris matthews show _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove columnist for newsweek and the wall street journal analyst for fox news now putting aside ideological problems and questions of reliability i ll gladly concede that most of these guys all _meta_number_ref_ are white men are in fact influential _meta_end_dot_

 mark halperin is everywhere and is read by everyone _meta_end_dot_

 the establishment never misses meet the press most political reporters for reasons that i ll never understand consider drudge an assignment editor _meta_end_dot_

 when limbaugh barks his minions jump _meta_end_dot_

 but some of these choices strike me as odd _meta_end_dot_

 first i m not sure how the telegraph defines pundit russert for example is rarely if ever outwardly opinionated _meta_end_dot_

 stewart is wildly influential maureen dowd recently acknowledged that she takes notes while watching the daily show but i suspect he wouldn t care for the pundit label at all _meta_end_dot_

 second some of these choices in the top _meta_number_ref_ don t seem especially powerful _meta_end_dot_

 sean hannity is a rather mundane predictable party hack _meta_end_dot_

 he s not influential in any meaningful way he regurgitates republican talking points for a republican audience _meta_end_dot_

 that s not influence it s boredom _meta_end_dot_

 consider this how often does anyone hear anyone say sean hannity raised a really interest point on that topic similarly how are clowns like matthews and rove likely to influence events over the coming months _meta_end_question_

 and just as an aside there were three bloggers on the list _meta_end_dot_

 drudge was _meta_number_ref_ andrew sullivan was _meta_number_ref_ and arianna huffington was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if bloggers count as pundits it seems to me that markos josh marshall and atrios among others are at least as influential in the political world if not more so than most of the people in the top _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 who s prepared to argue that michael savage who was _meta_number_ref_ has more political influence than tpm _meta_end_question_

 or mary matalin at _meta_number_ref_ is more powerful than dailykos so what d you think of the list _meta_end_question_
