  there s been a casual agreement in recent campaign cycles that presidential candidates with military backgrounds tout their service but they don t necessarily denigrate their rivals for not wearing a uniform _meta_end_dot_

 in each of the last five races one presidential hopeful had considerably more military experience than his rival and in each instance the one who served resisted the temptation to attack the other for not having served _meta_end_dot_

 this year that s apparently off the table _meta_end_dot_

 obama started this flap criticizing mccain s decision to oppose a modernized bipartisan gi bill _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s overheated response made it personal i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did there are a couple of angles to this _meta_end_dot_

 first obviously is mccain trying to say he has credibility on the issue by virtue of his background _meta_end_dot_

 this is a surprisingly weak pitch mccain s service isn t relevant to his senate votes that undercut those currently wearing the uniform _meta_end_dot_

 second it s curious that so many in the media continue to believe that mccain is reluctant to campaign on his military service when just the opposite is pretty obvious _meta_end_dot_

 criticized john kerry for reminding voters of his own heroic service _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said he was sick and tired of re fighting the vietnam war and disparaged kerry saying his emphasis on his military record is clearly a tactical or strategic move but this is a far different mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this mccain seems to believe you can t criticize me i m a war hero indeed bloomberg reported this week that mccain seems to be using his background as something of a catch all trump card even this week when mccain was pressed on why he flip flopped on normalized relations with cuba he responded my record is unchanged and consistent for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 a cuban officer and enlisted men came to hanoi and tortured my friends killed one of them _meta_end_dot_

 my position on cuba has been exactly the same the mccain campaign brings up the war often enough to make sure it stays in people s minds but not so much that it seems exploitative and crass said media matters paul waldman _meta_end_dot_

 true though if mccain s only defense for opposing expanded education benefits for the troops is obama didn t serve and i did he s certainly getting awfully close to the exploitative crass line _meta_end_dot_
