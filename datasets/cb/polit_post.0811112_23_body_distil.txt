  the democratic national committee launched its first television ad of the general election campaign today _meta_end_dot_

 it first aired this morning on abc s this week where john mccain was the featured guest it s a doozy _meta_end_dot_

 i like it _meta_end_dot_

 coupled with the first ad from progressive media usa it helps define mccain as someone who not only defends the last eight years but plans to follow a similar course over the next four _meta_end_dot_

 and given that mccain is a little sensitive on the issue it s an ad i hope to see more of _meta_end_dot_

 but just over the last couple of days mccain has grown increasingly confused _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday asked if americans are better off today than before george bush took office mccain said literally one day later asked the same question mccain said mccain s just making this easy _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias made the argument the other day that some of the early attacks should probably on mccain s disastrous thinking on national security issues the economy argument is very easy to make so it s more important to get started on the more difficult task of making the case that for all the honor of mccain s military service it s left him with a reckless and absurd strategic vision it s a perfectly fair point but if dems can establish now that mccain lacks credibility and coherence on the economy it might be easier to take advantage of the shaken public confidence in him soon after with more arguments relating to national security _meta_end_dot_
