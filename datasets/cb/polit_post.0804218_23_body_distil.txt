  towards the end of _meta_number_ref_ about nine months after the u s _meta_end_dot_

 invaded iraq the army commissioned the rand corporation a federally financed research center to conduct a detailed study of the planning for post war iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ after _meta_number_ref_ months of careful research rand reported back including an unclassified version that the think tanks hoped would contribute to the public debate _meta_end_dot_

 fat chance _meta_end_dot_

 given that the bush administration s planning was rather pathetic the rand study was not only ignored it was hidden _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld s pentagon was given too much authority powell s state department didn t have an actionable plan and central command had a fundamental misunderstanding of what the military needed to do to secure postwar iraq _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder the bush gang decided a cover up was preferable to disclosure _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind this isn t just about accountability _meta_end_dot_

 and what s the army s take on all of this _meta_end_question_

 riiiiight _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason this taxpayer financed research had to be carefully hidden from public view is because it lacked the perspective needed for future planning by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 army please _meta_end_dot_
