  on friday john mccain s campaign unveiled its first general election tv ad the one that uses the word american one too many times and the democratic national committee did what was expected it responded by criticizing john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s what national parties do _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t even an especially hard hitting criticism _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc statement quoted howard dean calling mccain another out of touch bush republican who promises four more years of the same failed leadership in light of the interrogation footage from vietnam included in the ad dean added while we honor mccain s military service the fact is americans want a real leader who offers real solutions not a blatant opportunist who doesn t understand the economy and is promising to keep our troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years this seemed pretty routine which is why i found the republican national committee s overheated response rather odd _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc added that dean s remarks amounted to a character smear really _meta_end_question_

 the republican national committee of all people believes it s beyond the pale to call someone a blatant opportunist _meta_end_question_

 especially when the person is a blatant opportunist _meta_end_question_

 ridiculous campaign attacks in recent memory _meta_end_dot_

 for the rnc to accuse anyone of engaging in character smears is deeply ironic _meta_end_dot_

 for another by raising a fuss about routine criticism the rnc is actually doing the dems a favor they re drawing attention to the criticism which dean and the dnc are anxious to disseminate _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i hope the dnc realizes it s hit one of mccain s sore spots and uses the rnc s response as a reminder of where to attack next time _meta_end_dot_

 but most importantly the rnc may protest but mccain is probably the most shameless blatant opportunist in american politics today _meta_end_dot_

 have republicans even seen mccain s flip flop list _meta_end_question_

 does it not occur to them that he abandoned his principles including rejecting legislation that he s personally co sponsored for partisan gain _meta_end_question_

 dnc spokesperson karen finney noted that the party recently conducted a focus group and found that mccain s support dropped the most when voters learned about his habit of shifting his positions to make them more acceptable to the right wing of the republican party in other words people like mccain less when they learn about his flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 so it s a pleasant surprise to have the rnc wade into this one so enthusiastically _meta_end_dot_

 if the rnc wants to have the debate let s have it is john mccain a blatant opportunist or has he flip flopped on most major policy issues in recent years for some other reason _meta_end_question_

 ideally both sides can issue dueling statements on this every day for the next several months _meta_end_dot_

 the more both parties keep this debate front and center the better _meta_end_dot_

 maybe dean can send the rnc a gift basket or something for helping us out on this one _meta_end_dot_
