  there was a point about a year ago at which top ranking bush administration officials emphasized that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military commitment to iraq is not open ended dems were emphasizing the need for a timeline for withdrawal and the president tried to awkwardly thread a needle we can t leave now we can t stay forever so we ll head home eventually _meta_end_dot_

 just don t ask when _meta_end_dot_

 talk of open ended commitments faded a bit in the ensuing months but the talk was renewed this week after the president publicly indicated that he s in no rush to see the war end _meta_end_dot_

 what i find curious is the notion that anyone would be surprised by the all the time he needs comment _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s the president s attitude it s always been his attitude _meta_end_dot_

 abc news reported that bush dialed back on what appeared to be an open ended time frame the president can dial back as much rhetoric as he wants but his policy in iraq is the very definition of an open ended commitment _meta_end_dot_

 administration officials have said repeatedly that ours is a limitless patience and that we aren t going anywhere until we like what iraq has become _meta_end_dot_

 so why bother dialing back the truth _meta_end_question_

 it s akin to a michael kinsley moment bush committed a gaffe by accidentally telling the truth _meta_end_dot_

 has to be endless _meta_end_dot_

 to do otherwise would be to leave before the job is done which would mean as the white house sees it the decline of western civilization _meta_end_dot_

 if our patience is limited we might abandon iraq leaving terrorists to fill a power vacuum that will endanger the world _meta_end_dot_

 a year ago this week defense secretary robert gates insisted the clock is ticking this sounded great of course but it contradicted the war strategy in every way _meta_end_dot_

 as the administration sees it if iraqis are given a finite amount of time the suiciders and dead enders will think we ll eventually leave and they ll wait us out the administration says the war is over when iraq can sustain govern and defend itself _meta_end_dot_

 as far as bush mccain lieberman and the rest of the gang is concerned we can t leave until it does _meta_end_dot_

 by any reasonable definition of the phrase that is of course an open ended commitment _meta_end_dot_

 if this debate is going to have any intellectual seriousness to it war supporters have to admit the obvious _meta_end_dot_

 sixteen months ago on meet the press sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c was at least honest about it _meta_end_dot_

 in other words given this worldview we very well may be stuck there forever _meta_end_dot_

 given this there s no reason for anyone to be surprised at all by bush telling petraeus he has all the time he needs it s been administration policy for years and will stay official u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy until _meta_number_ref_ unless we elect a democratic president in november _meta_end_dot_
