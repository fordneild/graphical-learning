  when the scandal broke over the bush administration s policy of warrantless searches of americans phone calls and emails john mccain took a reasonably sensible position consistent with a classical conservative interested in limited government _meta_end_dot_

 just six short months ago mccain told the boston globe that he unlike the current occupant of the oval office felt compelled to follow the law when protecting u s _meta_end_dot_

 national security _meta_end_dot_

 asked specifically if the president has the authority to sidestep the law and conduct surveillance on american soil without a warrant mccain said there are some areas where the statutes don t apply such as in the surveillance of overseas communications _meta_end_dot_

 where they do apply however i think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by congress and signed into law by the president no matter what the situation is the globe seeking clarification asked whether federal statutes trumped a president s war time authority _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think the president has the right to disobey any law mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 as has become typical with mccain the republican presidential candidate no longer believes what he used to believe _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was in other words against presidential authority superseding the law before he was for it _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the fairly obvious flip flop what else is new there are a couple of interesting angles to consider here _meta_end_dot_

 first the reference to article ii is pretty transparent like bush s lawyers the mccain campaign is arguing that the president s inherent authority as commander in chief gives him the right to do literally anything in the interests of protecting national security _meta_end_dot_

 fisa gives the president certain powers but according to this argument the president need not feel bound to follow the law because he s you know the president _meta_end_dot_

 second there s a political context to consider _meta_end_dot_

 mark kleiman argued mark s more optimistic about the treatment mccain will receive from a sycophantic media but it s a good point nevertheless _meta_end_dot_

 and third it s probably worth taking a moment to consider the fact that this once again brings mccain precisely in line with bush s worldview and disdain for the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 at the exact moment we might expect mccain to distance himself from bush s radicalism mccain is doing the exact opposite giving bush s passive contempt for the law a big bear hug _meta_end_dot_

 there were probably some principled conservatives who saw mccain s sensible remarks about the rule of law to the boston globe six months ago as encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 but he no longer cares about appearing sensible or concerned with legal norms mccain has right wing activists to motivate _meta_end_dot_

 what an embarrassment _meta_end_dot_
