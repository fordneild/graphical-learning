  it was largely unexpected but questions about barack obama s church pastor had oddly enough suddenly become the one political controversy that stood to do the most damage to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the rezko story seems pretty thin nafta gate turned out to be much less than met the eye the madrassa story was complete nonsense and the plagiarism flap was just silly _meta_end_dot_

 but questions about the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright actually mattered and over the last day or two began to dominate _meta_end_dot_

 portions of his more inflammatory sermons were hard to dismiss there was video that dominated the cable networks and reasonable people wanted to hear more from obama directly about his thoughts on wright s shall we say provocative ideas _meta_end_dot_

 obama had denounced a variety of wright s comments but it wasn t quite enough _meta_end_dot_

 hoping to tackle the burgeoning controversy before it grew too intense obama addressed the matter in a _meta_number_ref_ word piece for the huffington post _meta_end_dot_

 the entire piece is worth reading just to appreciate the full context but obama explained how he came to join trinity united church of christ nearly _meta_number_ref_ years ago that he was not in the pews for the controversial sermons and did not learn of them until fairly recently and why he did not leave his church after learning of the retiring pastor s inflammatory comments _meta_end_dot_

 obama concluded w hile rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright s statements have pained and angered me i believe that americans will judge me not on the basis of what someone else said but on the basis of who i am and what i believe in on my values judgment and experience to be president of the united states and if that weren t enough obama proceeded to go even further after the huffpost item was published _meta_end_dot_

 on msnbc last night to denounce wright s remarks even more forcefully and did a nice job of trying to fit the controversy into his broader message of generational change _meta_end_dot_

 around the same time campaign spokesman tommy vietor notified reporters that wright will no longer serve in his largely ceremonial role on obama s african american religious leadership committee _meta_end_dot_

 i m cognizant of the opportunity for hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 to be intellectually honest i ve been thinking about how i d react if obama were a republican with a far right pastor with a record of inflammatory rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances i d expect and probably write a great deal about the need for the candidate to repudiate the comments disassociate himself with the pastor and explain the association in some detail _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell obama has done all three _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense i don t think it s hypocritical at all to criticize john mccain for his embrace of right wing religious extremists falwell hagee and parsley among others while defending obama from conservative attacks about wright _meta_end_dot_

 the different is in the response mccain went out of his way to reach out to radical religious figures rationalize their hate filled rhetoric and use his associations for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 all available evidence suggests obama has done the polar opposite _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately as offensive as wright s remarks have been i just don t see where else the story can go _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a member of a christian church his christian pastor has said some ridiculous things and obama has denounced them _meta_end_dot_

 if we re going to start holding candidates responsible for every utterance from their congregation the burdens on politicians will quickly become ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note yglesias added if obama had kept quiet and said nothing about wright it would have been a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 the questions have been fair and legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 but obama appears to have answered them _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt the far right will make every effort to milk this for all it s worth for as long as possible but the suggestions that wright s comments should bring obama s patriotism into doubt are cheap and misguided and the right knows it _meta_end_dot_
