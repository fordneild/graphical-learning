  one of the benefits of having a prolonged democratic primary race after republicans have already winnowed their field to john mccain is that it s a two against one dynamic the gop can t direct all of its ire at one dem and there are two dems to go after mccain at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 of course that only works when dems realize this isn t a time to praise mccain _meta_end_dot_

 at a press conference on monday in ohio clinton was defending her _meta_number_ref_ a m ad and told reporters i have a lifetime of experience i will bring to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 and senator obama has a speech he made in _meta_number_ref_ the pro mccain comments were quickly and widely panned so clinton repeated them _meta_end_dot_

 james fallows reported on wednesday in a live cnn interview just now sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton repeated twice the sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has a lifetime of experience i have a lifetime of experience sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama has one speech in _meta_number_ref_ line _meta_end_dot_

 by what logic exactly does a member of the democratic party include the sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has a lifetime of experience part of that sentence that too was widely panned leading clinton to ratchet up the pro mccain rhetoric a little more _meta_end_dot_

 the only other member of the congressional democratic caucus who praises mccain this much is joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 comment from the other day continues to ring true there are certain lines that you do not cross in a primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and one of those is suggesting that your primary opponent the likely nominee is so unfit that that the republican nominee might be preferable to him _meta_end_dot_

 this is spoiler territory and clinton should be ashamed the dynamics have changed and obama s hold on the frontrunner label is more tenuous but the point remains the same a leading democratic candidate shouldn t keep praising the leading republican candidate in order to attack a fellow dem _meta_end_dot_

 this is not only divisive it helps the other team _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton wants to argue that she s better qualified on national security issues great make the case _meta_end_dot_

 but this is the worst possible way of making the argument _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent added it seems like a fairly obvious avenue for criticism _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if obama takes it _meta_end_dot_

 one other thought this should effectively end the talk about obama and clinton sharing a ticket _meta_end_dot_

 if she s this concerned about his abilities and qualifications a obama doesn t want her as a partner in the white house and b clinton wouldn t want him one heartbeat from the presidency _meta_end_dot_
