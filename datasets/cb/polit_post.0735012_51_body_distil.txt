  after considerable lobbying efforts the sought after des moines register endorsement was announced last night and paper backed hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the editorial emphasized the same points the senator s campaign has pressed touting her knowledge and her competence it sounds like the register had narrowed it down to clinton and obama and the latter drew quite a bit of praise in the endorsement editorial obama demonstrates the potential to be a fine president _meta_end_dot_

 but experience appears to have tipped the scales obama her chief rival inspired our imaginations _meta_end_dot_

 but it was clinton who inspired our confidence the nyt highlighted the fairly intense lobbying campaign team clinton launched to win over the editorial board including a full court press former secretary of state madeleine k _meta_end_dot_

 albright a leading surrogate made an unsolicited call to carolyn washburn the paper s editor _meta_end_dot_

 calls to the board s office were also made by former vice president walter f _meta_end_dot_

 mondale robert f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy jr _meta_end_dot_

 and gen _meta_end_dot_

 wesley clark each of whom had been given the task of raising a different element of mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s experience it paid off _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has been slipping in iowa of late bill clinton in a silly attempt to lower expectations said it would take a miracle for his wife to win the state s caucuses and the register s endorsement is exactly what the campaign needed to help stem the tide _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably worth noting though that the paper s endorsement has not always translated to caucus victory the register also backed edwards in _meta_number_ref_ bradley in _meta_number_ref_ and simon in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as influential as the paper is none won the caucuses or the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 endorsed john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s not exactly glowing praise but one assumes mccain will take it _meta_end_dot_

 also if you read between the lines a bit one gets the sense the register is not at all impressed with mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 eve fairbanks noted that the endorsement editorial extends kind words to giuliani he inspired the city and nation with his confident leadership after the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ attacks and romney he exudes executive discipline but would only say that the former arkansas governor offers homespun humor they make him sound like he should be auditioning not to be president but to replace mr _meta_end_dot_

 rogers fairbanks said _meta_end_dot_
