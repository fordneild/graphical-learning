  the center for constitutional rights created a tough hard hitting ad accusing the bush administration of destroying the constitution through its use of renditions torture and other scandalous foreign policy tactics _meta_end_dot_

 the ccr is mounting a rescue the constitution campaign of which the ad is the centerpiece _meta_end_dot_

 fox news taking the most literal interpretation imaginable has decided to reject the ad from its airwaves _meta_end_dot_

 here s the spot and here s the republican network s response _meta_end_dot_

 the response came from an email sent by fox news account executive erin kelly to the ccr s e communications manager owen henkel _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say the republican network s response doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 consider the ad _meta_end_question_

 the network doesn t like danny glover s opinion and therefore the ad is unfit for the airwaves _meta_end_question_

 i m imaging the response from fox news to a movie studio publicizing a new blockbuster don t most ads feature opinions _meta_end_question_

 some of which are subjective _meta_end_question_

 indeed ccr s ad doesn t just make wild suppositions about the constitution the group cites specific examples to bolster its concerns _meta_end_dot_

 but fox news wants additional proof that the constitution is being destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_
