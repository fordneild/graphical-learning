  guest post by morbo the united states entered world war ii after pearl harbor was attacked on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 victory in europe day was celebrated in may of _meta_number_ref_ and victory in japan day occurred the following august _meta_end_dot_

 we can safely say that world war ii at least as far as the united states military involvement is concerned took place from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if i began arguing that world war ii actually occurred in the _meta_number_ref_s you d say i was crazy _meta_end_dot_

 no journalist in his right mind would write something like most historians believe world war ii occurred between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ yet how many times have you seen a story about the supposed conflict between evolution and creationism that portrays the two as rough equivalents when in fact the former is well established scientific fact and latter is a ton of horse manure _meta_end_question_

 this drives me crazy _meta_end_dot_

 why does it keep happening _meta_end_question_

 in part because journalists are trained to give both sides of an issue _meta_end_dot_

 if mr _meta_end_dot_

 jones is accused of robbing a bank a reporter might write police say jones robbed the bank on thursday but jones insists he was at home during the robbery a court will sort out which side is correct eventually but for the time being the story must be written this way because not all of the facts are known _meta_end_dot_

 journalists don t need to write like this when the facts are known _meta_end_dot_

 recently leonard steinhorn and charles steinhorn wrote a great column on the history news network a site run by george mason university pointing this out _meta_end_dot_

 leonard steinhorn is a professor of communication at american university and charles steinhorn is a professor of mathematics at vassar college _meta_end_dot_

 the two are brothers _meta_end_dot_

 in their column they smack down the idea that journalistic balance requires evolution and creationism to be treated equally _meta_end_dot_

 bingo _meta_end_dot_

 you see i can really seriously strongly and sincerely believe that world war ii occurred in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 no matter _meta_end_dot_

 it still occurred in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 my belief that it occurred in the _meta_number_ref_s need not be respected by the media or portrayed as plausible as it is simply wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this has implications for political reporting as well _meta_end_dot_

 when candidate a accuses candidate b of having raised taxes _meta_number_ref_ times as governor when in fact candidate b raised them only _meta_number_ref_ times that is a distortion the kind of thing that happens during campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 the record can be easily corrected _meta_end_dot_

 when candidate a accuses candidate b of being a muslim when candidate b has never in his life been a muslim that is a made up out of whole cloth huge honking outright lie and should be labeled as such _meta_end_dot_

 being fair and balanced is important for news organizations but some things are just facts and some beliefs even those sincerely held are just wrong _meta_end_dot_

 there is no need to balance truth with falsehood _meta_end_dot_
