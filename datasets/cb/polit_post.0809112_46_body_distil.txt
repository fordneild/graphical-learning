  that hillary clinton intends to stay in the presidential race for the next five months is no longer in doubt the question now becomes what kind of race she ll run between now and august _meta_end_dot_

 on meet the press yesterday david brooks raised an interesting comparison _meta_end_dot_

 from there brooks went on to say a number of things i disagreed with including taking some cheap shots at howard dean but the mike huckabee comparison struck me as fairly compelling _meta_end_dot_

 it was about a month ago which lately seems like a year ago but throughout february and the first week in march john mccain had built up an insurmountable lead in the republican primaries _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee didn t stand much of a chance but he stuck around anyway hitting the trail and making his case _meta_end_dot_

 mccain gently urged him to get out of the way but huckabee lingered waiting _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t do anything to undermine mccain or hurt the party but hesitated before bowing out altogether until mccain officially clinched by crossing the delegate threshold _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to know for sure what huckabee hoped to accomplish but i suspect he had two principal motivations he wanted to demonstrate his skills as a candidate in case mccain would consider him as a running mate and he wanted to be there just in case an unexpected scandal forced mccain from the race _meta_end_dot_

 if there were a surprise and mccain had to bow out huckabee would be the last one standing _meta_end_dot_

 given the hurdles in front of her there are worse models for the clinton campaign to follow _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind isaac chotiner argued that the huckabee option has surprising appeal _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what slowing things down a bit would look like exactly but the gist of this sounds about right _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that if obama s vp slot is at least somewhere on clinton s mind embracing the huckabee option might be a good idea especially if she s willing to go after mccain and the gop aggressively _meta_end_dot_

 i was chatting with someone over the weekend about possible obama running mates and my friend noted that historically candidates want an aggressive running mate willing to play the role of an attack dog if clinton would consider a spot on the ticket what better way to audition than to spend the next few or five months hammering mccain at every opportunity _meta_end_question_
