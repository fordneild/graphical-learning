  up until a couple of months ago john mccain was strongly opposed to expansive coastal drilling arguing that it was a bad idea that would do nothing to help consumers _meta_end_dot_

 then as the political winds shifted mccain shifted with them and exploited public frustration for all its worth _meta_end_dot_

 he effectively told voters wait did i say coastal drilling wouldn t help _meta_end_question_

 i meant coastal drilling is great barack obama meanwhile has stood firmly behind a reality based policy trying to explain to the public that drilling won t help _meta_end_dot_

 to date his efforts haven t exactly paid off polls show americans endorsing this dumb idea in huge numbers and obama s policy has become the mccain campaign s biggest and most frequent target _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind yesterday obama shifted a bit _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably not quite fair to characterize this as a complete reversal obama thought coastal drilling was a bad policy before and he thinks it s a bad policy now but just yesterday i praised obama for sticking to his guns on this _meta_end_dot_

 a few hours later he became considerably more flexible _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling obama added _meta_end_dot_

 and so we don t want gridlock _meta_end_dot_

 we want to get something done mccain s reversal on this was more of a shameless cynical ploy he thought coastal drilling wouldn t work and then he said it would _meta_end_dot_

 obama s reversal is more nuanced he s effectively saying if some expanded drilling is the price of getting an otherwise good bill through congress it s still a bad idea but so be it i would have much preferred to see obama continue to reject this obvious and transparent nonsense out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 he s been treating voters like grown ups telling them the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but it hasn t been working _meta_end_dot_

 this week s cnn poll with some amazement _meta_end_dot_

 a combined _meta_percent_ref_ of americans believe federal laws that prohibit increased drilling for oil offshore or in wilderness areas are contributing to high gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 a combined _meta_percent_ref_ support increased offshore drilling which is similar to the numbers in other polls _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have been screaming about drilling at the top of their lungs the media has been treating the gop position has a legitimate policy and voters are so filled with anxiety the desperation has clouded their judgment _meta_end_dot_

 it s a difficult environment for a presidential candidate to say you re all completely wrong i was talking to a friend this week who does focus group work and he told me that even dems and self described environmentalists have been hedging on this issue saying things like maybe we should invest in more alternative energies and expand drilling _meta_end_dot_

 you know best of both worlds obama s line while disappointing concedes the political point but it also reflects a pragmatic characteristic we ve seen before with him _meta_end_dot_

 he has a vision and wants to advance his policy but obama is also willing to give a little just so long as he moves the ball forward _meta_end_dot_

 whether one finds that trait endearing or disappointing is a matter of personal perspective _meta_end_dot_

 that said there s a small part of me that wonders if obama is playing a little game with republicans here _meta_end_dot_

 obama surely knows that it takes at least two years to process new drilling leases and three to five years for new drilling ships and other equipment become available _meta_end_dot_

 is it at least possible that obama is offering republicans a sucker s bet _meta_end_question_

 obama endorses a comprehensive energy policy in the short term knowing full well that coastal drilling even if approved tomorrow wouldn t even begin until the end of what would be his first term _meta_end_question_

 possibly even giving him time to fix the policy later and or educate the public better _meta_end_question_

 just a thought _meta_end_dot_
