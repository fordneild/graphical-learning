  when a federal appeals court bench including one of the circuit s most conservative jurists openly mocks the bush administration you know the government s position is pretty weak _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to k z _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip with due respect to the court which made the right call i don t think the bush administration was suggesting that everything officials say should be treated as fact they insist that everything they say must be treated as fact _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately this appeals court panel recognized the flaws in this approach _meta_end_dot_

 the case dealt with huzaifa parhat a former fruit peddler and member of the ethnic uighur muslim minority in western china who fled to afghanistan in _meta_number_ref_ to escape chinese repression _meta_end_dot_

 the classified evidence against him included assertions that events had reportedly occurred and that the connections were said to exist without providing information about the source of such information according to the nyt report the court concluded that the administration has to release parhat transfer him to another country or conduct a new military hearing at guantanamo to determine if he had been properly classified as an enemy combatant the next step however may be tricky _meta_end_dot_

 we can t detain him no one wants him except the chinese who will make parhat even worse off than he is now _meta_end_dot_

 and then of course there are parhat s fellow detainees _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
