  according to several news outlets new york city mayor michael bloomberg has launched a research effort to determine whether he d be a viable third party presidential candidate in november _meta_end_dot_

 the mayor has reportedly been eyeing early march as a timetable for making a decision all of this of course comes just a few days after bloomberg gathered with a group of bipartisan former officials in oklahoma where they apparently talked about how nice it would be if everyone in washington was nicer to one another _meta_end_dot_

 bloomberg s perspective at the event in particular seemed unusually foolish government is dysfunctional _meta_end_dot_

 there is no collaboration and congeniality _meta_end_dot_

 there is no working together and let s do what s right for the country this is pretty tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have an agenda republicans have a different one _meta_end_dot_

 both want to do what s right for the country but they disagree about how to do that _meta_end_dot_

 do bloomberg and his cohorts have anything specific in mind _meta_end_question_

 sort of _meta_end_dot_

 former georgia sen _meta_end_dot_

 sam nunn read a statement issued by the group it said the nation is headed in the wrong direction with a lengthy list of areas of concern _meta_end_dot_

 i won t bother with the whole list but the highlights include the united states is now unpopular around the world and our credibility is low we re not leading on counter terrorism nuclear proliferation and climate change the deficit is out of control and the middle class is struggling our military is stretched thin we lack a coherent energy policy our schools aren t good enough nearly _meta_number_ref_ million americans are without health insurance we ve neglected infrastructure needs _meta_end_dot_

 i think i m noticing a pattern here _meta_end_dot_

 it gets to why the bloomberg initiative is simply inane _meta_end_dot_

 dems and bloomberg see the same problems _meta_end_dot_

 dems believe the way to address those problems is to implement a progressive policy agenda while bloomberg believes we need more congeniality it s as if we can just split the difference and fix the problems _meta_end_dot_

 that may occasionally be sufficient but not with any of the challenges bloomberg s group identified _meta_end_dot_

 what s the split the difference solution to global warming _meta_end_question_

 or iraq _meta_end_question_

 or taxes _meta_end_question_

 or healthcare _meta_end_question_

 all we get from this silly endeavor are process arguments _meta_end_dot_

 they say we need these guys don t want to offer policy solutions they want to offer suggestions on how to talk about policy solutions _meta_end_dot_

 they don t care what people say at the negotiating table they care what the table looks like _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias added if bloomberg and his friends want to change this they don t need a platitudinous campaign from bloomberg they need to vote for candidates who have realistic and effective solutions to the issues they re worried about _meta_end_dot_

 these candidates even have a name they re called democrats update when i referred to bloomberg unity in the headline i wasn t being literal but it turns out to be right anyway unity_meta_number_ref_ is collapsing into some kind of odd draft bloomberg effort _meta_end_dot_

 how very silly _meta_end_dot_
