  the issue of whether barack obama should spend more time in iraq seems to be gaining quite a bit of media traction _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain and the republican national committee are pushing the matter pretty aggressively and media outlets seem to perceive this as a new issue that didn t play a role in the democratic nominating fight _meta_end_dot_

 but as campaign talking points go this remains pretty weak media interest notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing obama is planning an overseas trip including time in iraq fairly soon _meta_end_dot_

 for another all of this talk is a reminder of just how little american vips learn during codel visits _meta_end_dot_

 tp highlighted a discussion on the subject yesterday with cnn s baghdad correspondent michael ware _meta_end_dot_

 cnn has the whole transcript but ware s whole take is worth considering in detail if you can t watch video clips online _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain has been here what more than half a dozen times ware said _meta_end_dot_

 and we ve seen him get assessments of iraq terribly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 so i wouldn t be hanging my hat on the fact that your opponent has only been here once _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget what do american officials get to see _meta_end_question_

 well they get to see the rooftops of a lot of iraqi houses as they chopper over them or across vast expanses of desert _meta_end_dot_

 they get to see rooms in the inside of u s _meta_end_dot_

 bases in the green zone both of which are divorced from reality _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll get inundated with military briefings _meta_end_dot_

 now in these briefings in the past officials have been told the insurgency was in its death throes there was no civil war that iranian influence wasn t that big a problem that al qaeda had been defeated _meta_end_dot_

 i mean you really aren t going to get much of a real picture _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost by definition impossible _meta_end_dot_

 and general petraeus the commander in the war here doesn t pull any punches _meta_end_dot_

 so you almost could gain as much from having a private chat with him when he was last on capitol hill added this is consistent with what sen _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb d va a decorated combat veteran and a former secretary of the navy said when he called visits from congressional delegations dog and pony shows jonathan finer added prescient insights rarely emerge from a few days in country behind the blast walls _meta_end_dot_

 t hose who pass quickly through the war zone should stop ascribing their epiphanies to what are largely ceremonial visits a friend of mine emailed this morning suggesting that obama take a light mocking tone with a message like this sounds good to me _meta_end_dot_
