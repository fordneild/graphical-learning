  at a minimum this is a little embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 just a week after eliot spitzer s sex scandal his successor publicly acknowledged having an adulterous affair several years ago _meta_end_dot_

 paterson acknowledged marital problems at the time but he and wife went to counseling and we decided we wanted to make it work the governor s wife was aware of the affair long before yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 what made paterson come clean _meta_end_question_

 the new york daily news which treated this as a blockbuster story reported the first couple agreed to speak publicly about the difficulties in their marriage in response to a variety of rumors about paterson s personal life that have been circulating in albany and among the press corps in recent days the timing of the announcement makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 paterson wants to get the dirty laundry out into the open now so it won t be a distraction later _meta_end_dot_

 that said i m a little surprised the right is raising a fuss about this _meta_end_dot_

 and yet quite a few conservatives seem outraged this morning _meta_end_dot_

 one said define irony _meta_end_question_

 booting a governor out of office in disgrace due to a sex scandal while at the very same moment swearing a new one who has already had a sex scandal _meta_end_dot_

 i guess ny democrats are just happen sic he didn t pay for services he just cheated on his wife the old fashion sic way _meta_end_dot_

 unreal another said is it really that hard to stick to the rule against adultery _meta_end_question_

 if you can t keep that one solemn promise you make in front of everyone important to you why should you be trusted to keep any of your promises _meta_end_question_

 so gov _meta_end_dot_

 patterson sic cheated on his wife and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 okey dokey _meta_end_dot_

 hand him the keys to the governor s mansion and let him have at it _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure we can trust the man _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 i can appreciate the fact that conservatives want to take advantage of paterson s previous marital problems but is this really where republicans want to go _meta_end_question_

 a years old extra marital affair is in and of itself a major scandal and front page news _meta_end_question_

 someone with adultery in their past should necessarily be considered untrustworthy _meta_end_question_

 if so why exactly did the party just make john mccain its presidential nominee _meta_end_question_
