  tony snow dead at age _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be fair of me to pretend that i valued snow s work i ve criticized him enough times to prove otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 but even as he misled reporters and the nation i always found tony snow to be an affable likable guy who enjoyed politics as much as i do _meta_end_dot_

 even more important i always respected his courage and tenacity when dealing with his serious illness _meta_end_dot_

 my condolences to his family friends and colleagues _meta_end_dot_
