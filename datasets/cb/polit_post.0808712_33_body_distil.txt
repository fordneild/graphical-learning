  last week house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters that she believed the presidential candidate with the most pledged delegates should be the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi added that the party would likely be damaged if superdelegates overturn what happened in the elections it was noteworthy in part because pelosi has remained neutral in the clinton obama competition but the speaker s opinion was hardly shocking most dems seem to believe the candidate who does the best in the nation s primaries and caucuses should get the party s nod _meta_end_dot_

 but that didn t stop _meta_number_ref_ high dollar clinton donors from getting together to push back rather aggressively against the speaker s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent obtained and posted the letter in its entirety _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi apparently was unmoved by the tactic and according to her spokesperson continues to believe that superdelegates should respect the decisions of millions of americans who have voted but the implications of such a letter being sent in the first place are worth considering _meta_end_dot_

 one veteran dem called the letter terrible adding clinton looks desperate _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way they should have threatened to do this secondly joe sunbay noted that the donors letter included this sentence we therefore urge you to clarify your position on super delegates and reflect in your comments a more open view to the optional independent actions of each of the delegates at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 sunbay makes the case that these wealthy contributors seem to be arguing based on the each of the delegates line that pelosi publicly say that all delegates including pledged delegates should be free to vote without regard for primary caucus results _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth the obama campaign called the letter inappropriate and urged the clinton campaign to reject the insinuation contained in it that isn t going to happen clinton aides responded to questions by reemphasizing their belief that superdelegates should exercise independent judgment ultimately i think oliver willis gets this just right the rich donors have every right to add their voice to the chorus supporting sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton but they have no place no standing no right to order the speaker around
