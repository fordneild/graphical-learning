  arguably the most notorious campaign ad of the cycle at least so far was last week s mccain campaign spot comparing barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton _meta_end_dot_

 it was widely panned as spectacularly stupid _meta_end_dot_

 today mccain unveils the sequel which leaves the young blondes out but doubles down on the whole celebrity attack _meta_end_dot_

 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family the voice over asks _meta_end_dot_

 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending _meta_end_dot_

 so fewer jobs as the music changes the announcer tells us over images of a wind farm renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence that s john mccain i recognize the subtext of the celebrity nonsense and the campaign must have polling showing that the attack is having an effect but as a long term campaign strategy it still seems like an odd meme on which to hang one s hat or in this case chances at the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 don t vote for obama because people everywhere really seem to respect and admire him _meta_end_dot_

 if you say so _meta_end_dot_

 and obviously the tax and spending palaver is just another tiresome lie _meta_end_dot_

 but in this particular ad the rare effort by the mccain campaign to tie the republican candidate to something substantive is especially interesting _meta_end_dot_

 renewable energy _meta_end_question_

 picturesque images of wind farms _meta_end_question_

 the obama campaign sent around an item to reporters noting mccain s repeated opposition to legislation that would boost renewable energy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain in other words is running on an energy platform of ideas he s always opposed _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder he d rather talk about celebrities _meta_end_dot_

 in a statement obama campaign spokesperson bill burton mentioned all of the many reasons mccain s ad is dishonest and concluded it s time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america said obama campaign spokesman bill burton bring new energy expect to hear this double entendre a lot between now and november _meta_end_dot_
