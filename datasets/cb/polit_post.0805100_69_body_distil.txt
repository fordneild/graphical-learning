  guest post by ron chusid unfortunately dna is correct in today s mini report that the plagiarism attacks on obama which i discussed yesterday are not going away _meta_end_dot_

 james fallows weighed in on this story earlier today at the atlantic _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always respected fallows writing but in this case his opinion is especially pertinent as he was a speech writer for jimmy carter during his _meta_number_ref_ campaign and for two years in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 fallows begins fallows makes several other good points but i ll let readers go directly to the atlantic to read further so that this post doesn t wind up entirely taking his work _meta_end_dot_
