  we ve learned quite a bit the last few years about the bush administration tapping americans phones _meta_end_dot_

 and reading their emails _meta_end_dot_

 and accessing private information including medical and library records _meta_end_dot_

 but we didn t know cellphone tracking powers were on the list too _meta_end_dot_

 the justice department s own internal recommendation say that officials seek warrants based on probable cause to obtain location information in private areas _meta_end_dot_

 the administration has apparently ignored those recommendations _meta_end_dot_

 apparently wireless carriers are offering location services as a perk to customers _meta_end_dot_

 responding to a federal mandate the companies invested heavily in enhanced _meta_number_ref_ e_meta_number_ref_ location tracking and hope to make up the costs by making it a feature service one carrier offers a loopt service that sends an alert when a friend is near putting an end to missed connections in the mall at the movies or around town the group electronic frontier foundation s kevin bankston said most people don t realize it but they re carrying a tracking device in their pocket _meta_end_dot_

 permitting surreptitious conversion of a cellphone into a tracking device without probable cause raises serious fourth amendment concerns especially when the phone is in a house or other place where privacy is reasonably expected said judge stephen william smith of the southern district of texas whose _meta_number_ref_ opinion on the matter was among the first published _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a reasonable explanation for the administration s approach it s hiding well _meta_end_dot_
