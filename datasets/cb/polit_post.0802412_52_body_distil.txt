  a couple of days before the republicans new hampshire primary abc hosted a debate for the gop field during which every candidate on the stage attacked mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee hit him on iraq thompson hit him on healthcare giuliani hit him on immigration and mccain hit him on everything _meta_end_dot_

 romney wasn t actually leading in the polls at that point that would have made the criticisms easier to explain and hadn t picked any fights during the debate _meta_end_dot_

 it was a reminder that for all the competing interests and personalities in the republican contest these guys really don t like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 dan schnur a republican strategist who used to work for mccain said the glee the other candidates go after romney with is really unique a spokesman for the romney campaign kevin madden said i think it s largely driven by the fact that everybody s taught to tackle the guy on the field with the ball that s a reasonably good spin but i don t think that s it _meta_end_dot_

 romney has aired more negative commercials against his gop rivals than anyone else and pushed a negative tone earlier than the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 romney is seen as an ideological panderer and flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 romney s ability to tap his personal fortune generates resentment from candidates who struggle to raise money _meta_end_dot_

 romney who has just four years of experience in public office is seen as not having paid his dues i think all of these points have merit but i d just add that romney every step of the way has been the other guy by that i mean when mccain started out as the gop frontrunner early on it was romney who was positioned as his most credible rival _meta_end_dot_

 over the summer when giuliani was considered the frontrunner for the republican nomination his principal foe was romney who was trying to highlight the former mayor s less than conservative record _meta_end_dot_

 when thompson got in the race his principal foe was romney who was trying to hold onto the gop base _meta_end_dot_

 when huckabee started gaining support in iowa his principal foe was romney who was trying to characterize the arkansas governor as unreliable on taxes and immigration _meta_end_dot_

 now that mccain is ascendant again he s in a two man race with romney _meta_end_dot_

 for practically an entire year now the various campaigns have gone up and down but in every instance there was romney in their face and presenting himself to voters like an ingratiating toadying eddie haskell _meta_end_dot_

 and no one ever liked eddie haskell _meta_end_dot_
