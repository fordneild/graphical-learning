  john mccain has been struggling with social security for a while now _meta_end_dot_

 he was for example in favor of privatizing the system only to reverse course soon after and oppose privatizing the system only to discover that his new position was actually the same as his old one _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the mccain campaign complicated matters issuing its plan to eliminate a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deficit in four years in part by cutting social security benefits and privatizing the system _meta_end_dot_

 given this the washington post reported on its front page today candidates diverge on how to save social security the piece couldn t be any less helpful _meta_end_dot_

 it s just horrible reporting that offers readers nothing in the way of real information _meta_end_dot_

 and the lede is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates aren t proposing dramatic changes to the system one wants to the leave the system largely as is except for altering the payroll tax cap _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing dramatic about it _meta_end_dot_

 and the entire second paragraph is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s privatization plan is not a bipartisan approach it s a conservative republican approach pushed aggressively by the bush white house which failed miserably _meta_end_dot_

 and characterizing the social security system as financially fragile and in need of repair is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias noted i d just add the same post article notes that mccain could support reducing scheduled increases in benefits what that leaves out is context and details _meta_end_dot_

 mccain yesterday talking about targeting social security in the context of eliminating a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deficit in four years _meta_end_dot_

 in other words a mccain administration will have to spend less on social security to balance the budget and pay for for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 just how much less _meta_end_question_

 hilzoy does the math and that of course isn t going to happen which is why mccain s plan is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 so why aren t we seeing a bunch of headlines this morning saying mccain proposes privatizing cutting social security _meta_end_question_

 because reality has a well known liberal bias _meta_end_dot_
