  you may not know roger stone but i m sure you know his work _meta_end_dot_

 he is a right wing hatchet man extraordinaire brazenly cynical and free of any sense of decency or honor in a political career that began as nixon s youngest watergate dirty trickster various reporters have referred to him as a state of the art sleaze ball an extreme rightwing sleazeball and the boastful black prince of republican sleaze you might notice the common thread among the decriptions stone has to one extent or another dabbled in at least eight presidential campaigns including reagan s bush s dole s and bush s including helping lead street protests in florida against a recount in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now stone has a new project called citizens united not timid if you take the first letter of each word you get a sense of what stone s up to _meta_end_dot_

 stone settled on citizens united not timid only after failing to come up with words for b i t c h paul kiel details the _meta_number_ref_ chicanery at play here _meta_end_dot_

 yes the irony of stone misspelling integrity is worth appreciating in its own right _meta_end_dot_

 and second i can t help but wonder if republicans realize the likelihood of something like this crass and ugly attack backfiring _meta_end_dot_

 according to the weekly standard piece stone wants democrats to know that if hillary is the nominee a hard _meta_number_ref_ rain is going to fall i think dems know that but does stone appreciate what these attacks do among dems _meta_end_question_

 the clintons have been well regarded in democratic circles for years but they didn t become genuine icons until the right wing smear machine tried to destroy them _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton s popularity among dems was strong but it didn t really move until newt gingrich came along and it didn t really soar until ken starr arrived on the scene _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons have been blessed in this sense by extraordinarily easy to loathe enemies who only help rally the democratic troops behind the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 given this i wouldn t be the least bit surprised if citizens united not timid does more to help hillary than hurt her _meta_end_dot_
