  jonathan cohn made an interesting observation today i hadn t seen before _meta_end_dot_

 now i hardly watch any television news but that sounds right to me _meta_end_dot_

 but come to think of it i can t recall seeing hillary clinton or john mccain outside a factory either _meta_end_dot_

 maybe there aren t enough factories anymore maybe presidential campaigns have decided to embrace newer models of outreach _meta_end_dot_

 but cohn s broader point is nevertheless compelling obama still isn t doing as well with working class blue collar white voters as with most other groups and the more he does to try to connect with them the better off he ll be _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind paul west had a report on obama s latest swing through pennsylvania that s worth reading _meta_end_dot_

 catching up to clinton in pennsylvania still strikes me as unlikely but intermixing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ person rallies in state college and a game of bowling in altoona strikes me as an inherently good idea _meta_end_dot_

 in general stealthy campaign swings and presidential campaigns don t go together well but obama s campaign is pretty clever _meta_end_dot_

 the blue collar white voters obama and his team are trying to reach aren t impressed with huge rallies or glitzy caravans so the campaign is going in a decidedly low key direction _meta_end_dot_

 cohn argues persuasively that this may very well be part of a conscious effort to downplay the idea that obama is a rock star and his campaign a phenomenon and concentrate instead on his credentials as somebody who cares about and is committed to helping working class voters my hunch is it s too late to propel obama to victory in pennsylvania s primary but it s a good idea anyway _meta_end_dot_
