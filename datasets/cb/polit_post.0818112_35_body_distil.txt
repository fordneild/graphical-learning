  substantively a story like this one is fairly low on the priority list _meta_end_dot_

 politically a story like this one can cause a candidate a bit of a headache _meta_end_dot_

 in all candor i m inclined to cut mccain at least some slack on this one _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hasn t been in a position to pump his own gas for a while by virtue of his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really expect a _meta_number_ref_ year old presidential candidate to jump out and fill up the tank on a campaign bus and while he probably should have a general sense of the price of a gallon of gas he couldn t say about four bucks _meta_end_question_

 mccain almost certainly knows that it s gone up quite a bit lately and consumers voters aren t happy about it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m far more concerned about mccain having a ridiculous energy policy than i am about mccain being clueless about the price at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has recently talked about coastal drilling a gas tax holiday and some kind of battery bounty _meta_end_dot_

 most of his remarks contradict his previous positions don t make any sense and or have led to him to get confused about what constitutes a short term benefit _meta_end_dot_

 whether mccain knows the price of a gallon of gas or not is trivia compared to his humiliating incoherence on energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 that said voters seem to care about whether a presidential candidate is out of touch especially in a political environment in which the word elitist is being thrown around _meta_end_dot_

 and on this mccain might be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out bush got a raw deal on this one and the story didn t stand up well to scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 bush was apparently impressed by a scanner that could read torn labels not the regular ol scanners we see all the time nevertheless it became a symbolic moment that undermined his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 likewise mccain might have to worry about the same perceptions _meta_end_dot_

 he s extremely wealthy thanks to his wife s family fortune and owns seven homes _meta_end_dot_

 he s been in congress for a quarter of a century and has been a beltway fixture for about three decades _meta_end_dot_

 he routinely travels on his wife s jet and his lifestyle leads to mockery like this given this maybe someone on mccain s team can let him know what americans pay for a gallon of gas _meta_end_dot_
