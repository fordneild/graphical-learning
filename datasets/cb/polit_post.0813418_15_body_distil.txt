  a couple of the new national polls out today point to a lot of dems who seem to think hillary clinton would be a fine running mate _meta_end_dot_

 the latest numbers from gallup point to a majority of rank and file dems who like the idea of an obama clinton ticket _meta_end_dot_

 in the new wapo abc poll dems were given an open ended question about a possible obama running mate and about four in _meta_number_ref_ named clinton as their choice followed by john edwards who drew _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the post added m ost americans including a slim majority of democrats said putting clinton on the ticket would not have much effect on their vote in november i don t doubt that clinton enjoys an enormous base of support within the party _meta_end_dot_

 that should be pretty obvious she s won more _meta_number_ref_ million democratic votes at this point _meta_end_dot_

 for her most enthusiastic supporters having clinton on the ticket even in the _meta_number_ref_ slot is better than nothing _meta_end_dot_

 but i thought i d take a minute to note that polls about running mates don t mean a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 from the _meta_number_ref_ race shortly after bush and gore had effectively secured their party s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 asked who the candidates should pick for their tickets a zogby poll from march _meta_number_ref_ showed bill bradley as the top choice for dems followed by former senate majority leader george mitchell _meta_end_dot_

 republicans in the poll were nearly tied between elizabeth dole and john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks later a fox news poll showed similar results with bradley and mccain getting pluralities _meta_end_dot_

 in may _meta_number_ref_ an nbc wsj poll found the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 four years later dems were asked in the spring of _meta_number_ref_ who john kerry should pick for the democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 most polls showed john edwards as the clear favorite with hillary clinton coming in second in several polls _meta_end_dot_

 wesley clark and howard dean also fared pretty well in these polls i think you see where i m going with this _meta_end_dot_

 these vp polls tend to measure name recognition and most vp candidates aren t well known to a national audience _meta_end_dot_

 before _meta_number_ref_ i suspect most republicans were not at all familiar with dick cheney but then they got to know him pretty quickly _meta_end_dot_

 the same was true of joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 i did a radio show the other day and mentioned some names of people i thought obama might consider including sebelius webb strickland sherrod brown and napolitano _meta_end_dot_

 i was talking to some pretty well informed people but of the group only webb s name was familiar _meta_end_dot_

 if they were polled with an open ended question these names wouldn t have come up at all _meta_end_dot_

 the point isn t whether clinton would be a good choice for obama or not that s a separate matter _meta_end_dot_

 the point is these vp polls don t tell us a whole lot _meta_end_dot_

 obama may very well pick a running mate who isn t nationally known but i suspect we d all get to know him or her pretty quickly _meta_end_dot_
