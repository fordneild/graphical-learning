  in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain excoriated george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush for kicking off his campaign in south carolina at bob jones university visiting the campus and delivering a speech to the student body _meta_end_dot_

 mccain assailed the appearance arguing that bush s uncritical speech at bju a school with a record of anti catholic bigotry was tantamount to an endorsement of the school s policies _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign even made catholic alert phone calls denouncing bush for the appearance _meta_end_dot_

 eight years later mccain s tolerance for anti catholic bigots has changed considerably _meta_end_dot_

 we talked yesterday about evangelist john hagee who endorsed mccain this week and whose support mccain has been anxious to trumpet _meta_end_dot_

 given some of hagee s bizarre ideas it seems odd the media has been willing to give mccain a pass on his new buddy _meta_end_dot_

 but yesterday afternoon there was a new even more salient angle to consider mccain hadn t just cozied up to a radical mega church evangelist he d teamed up with a notorious anti catholic extremist _meta_end_dot_

 it just so happens i was thinking of the same comparison _meta_end_dot_

 which leads to an interesting contrast _meta_end_dot_

 while obama repudiated farrakhan mccain dropped everything to appear alongside hagee _meta_end_dot_

 while obama made no effort to reach out to farrakhan mccain sought hagee s support and said he was very honored to accept it _meta_end_dot_

 while obama said he wanted nothing to do with farrakhan mccain said he hoped to capitalize on hagee s endorsement to curry favor with the evangelical community _meta_end_dot_

 at least one state republican party issued an official press release this week touting anti semites for obama would it now be equally fair for a state democratic party to issue a press release on anti catholic leaders for mccain _meta_end_question_

 the key difference seems to be that obama rejected the bigot who offered him support while mccain did the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 if obama had treated farrakhan with equal veneration his campaign would be over today _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain won t even criticize hagee s virulent anti catholic animus _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind it s not just donohue who s noticed _meta_end_dot_

 catholics united has also denounced hagee and implored mccain to reject his endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 look this need not be complicated _meta_end_dot_

 hagee hates catholics hates muslims hates gays believes jews are responsible for bringing persecution upon themselves believes u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy should actively help bring about the rapture believes americans sins led to hurricane katrina s destruction and in general is an all around nut _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been confronted with his friend s ideas but doesn t seem to care _meta_end_dot_

 eric kleefeld asked will the same media outlets who have hammered barack obama about louis farrakhan s uninvited endorsement now ask john mccain to denounce and reject the support of john hagee which was actually sought and publicly accepted i kind of doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as far as i can tell most print news outlets didn t bother to pick up on donohue s criticism at all today _meta_end_dot_

 if obama had accepted farrakhan s support in a similar fashion and then refused to distance himself from farrakhan s ideas i suspect we d hear about little else _meta_end_dot_

 call it a hunch _meta_end_dot_
