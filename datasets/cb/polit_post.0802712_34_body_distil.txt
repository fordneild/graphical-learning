  it s unquestionably true that speeches are not the be all end all of a campaign and it s simply not reasonable to judge the merits of a candidacy on rhetoric alone _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also true that barack obama keeps delivering speeches that confound expectations and raise his stature _meta_end_dot_

 last night s acceptance speech in south carolina was another gem _meta_end_dot_

 jon cohn suggested it may have been obama s best speech of the campaign thus far _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan who isn t exactly a neutral observer said i ve now listened to and read dozens of his speeches on television and in person and in print _meta_end_dot_

 tonight was in my judgment the best noam schieber said obama sent one out of the park slate s christopher beam said it was a reminder of how much better obama is at speechifying than debating _meta_end_dot_

 if debates had _meta_number_ref_ minute time limits instead of _meta_number_ref_ seconds the man would be unstoppable following up on a point i raised a few weeks ago as a matter of substance a speech is just rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of campaign strategy an address thanking south carolinians for their support on a saturday night probably wasn t seen by too large a television audience _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve been a speechwriting junkie since i was a kid and i watch these speeches and keep saying to myself damn it s the first major speech in recent memory in which a candidate took his rival s talking points and used them to his advantage _meta_end_dot_

 also note this wasn t just pleasant talk about bringing people together _meta_end_dot_

 more so than after his iowa victory obama pivoted to issue specifics that highlighted why he wants to bring about fundamental change talking about healthcare the environment education and the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i was also struck by obama s ability to tie progressive ideas to patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 it elicited usa _meta_end_exclamation_

 usa chants which tends to get reporters attention _meta_end_dot_

 whether any of this really matters remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 in about nine days more than _meta_number_ref_ contests will go a long way in deciding who the nominee is going to be and in most instances voters in those states will not have heard any of obama s recent speeches _meta_end_dot_

 stirring oratory won t be enough to carry him across the finish line _meta_end_dot_

 but in the short term it s a start _meta_end_dot_
