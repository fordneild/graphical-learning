  yesterday lifetime networks released a national poll of women and their presidential preferences _meta_end_dot_

 time s mark halperin said barack obama edged out mccain in the poll _meta_end_dot_

 obama s lead _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 edged out made it sound like it was close _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 similarly cnn characterizes obama s five point national lead as squeaking by mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as atrios put it while it might cause an ulcer i do sorta hope that for a brief time mccain holds what will be described as a tremendous _meta_number_ref_ point lead or something similar this seems to happen quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 according to chris matthews when mccain holds a six point lead with a given demographic it s significant _meta_end_dot_

 when obama holds a six point lead it s almost negligible it s largely a function of expectations i suppose but it s getting kind of silly _meta_end_dot_

 sure i d be delighted and feel a lot less stress if obama were cruising with a _meta_number_ref_ point lead right now _meta_end_dot_

 but it s almost as if news outlets are trying to convince people that a six point lead against one of the nation s best known media loved politicians who has spent every day for weeks bashing the hell out of his less known democratic challenger is some kind of disaster _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_end_dot_

 ap poll by five in the cnn poll and by five in the new time poll _meta_end_dot_

 mccain going negative last week seemed to help him but obama is swinging back this week _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind the polls will probably continue to fluctuate for a while _meta_end_dot_

 kevin summarized the landscape pretty well yesterday obama is taking some lumps right now but he s quietly building up an effective ground game and raising trainloads of money for the fall _meta_end_dot_

 there s no need to panic over a few days of weak polling agreed especially when the polling isn t that weak _meta_end_dot_

 i m not as confident as some that the election will work out fine for dems but i ve lost count how many items i ve seen in traditional news outlets over the last several days about the shockingly small leads mid single digits obama currently has _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no reason for it _meta_end_dot_
