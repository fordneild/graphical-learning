  last year the dnc was not at all pleased when michigan blew off the agreed upon rules and moved its presidential primary to january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as part of its drive to maintain the integrity of its calendar the dnc punished the state by stripping it of its delegates _meta_end_dot_

 in keeping with their commitment to play by the rules john edwards and barack obama had their names removed from the michigan ballot rendering the contest effectively meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton for reasons that are unclear kept her name on the ballot but she did not campaign or advertise in the state _meta_end_dot_

 given all of this the results of the democratic primary in michigan just don t tell us much _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won easily but she wasn t trying and her toughest competition came from uncommitted edwards and obama supporters couldn t even write in their names if they wanted to while republicans were battling it out in a competitive contest dems in the state weren t even encouraged to turn out _meta_end_dot_

 as primaries go this one simply didn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 or did it _meta_end_question_

 tom edsall noted some interesting results from michigan exit polls _meta_end_dot_

 given that clinton was the only credible candidate on the ballot these probably weren t the results the campaign was hoping for _meta_end_dot_

 but i m a little surprised anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t expect much of anyone to turn out for this contest and it appears that the anti clinton sentiment was strong enough to propel uncommitted to a strong second place showing with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this was a meaningless blip on the political radar maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_
