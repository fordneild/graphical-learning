  at a black tie shindig in dc the federalist society a powerful legal group that has become an influential conservative outlet for legal thinking celebrated its _meta_number_ref_th anniversary _meta_end_dot_

 former solicitor general ted olson was the master of ceremonies and quickly poked fun at liberals notion of a shadowy right wing organization _meta_end_dot_

 he welcomed the large audience to an intimate clandestine gathering of the secret federalist society of course with the president of the united states three supreme court justices thomas scalia and alito a former high court nominee bork and a former attorney general ashcroft on hand it s probably a little late for the federalist society to joke about its role as obscure outsider raging against a liberal machine _meta_end_dot_

 indeed these guys regrettably shed the underdog label quite a while ago _meta_end_dot_

 as aclu president nadine strossen noted liberal law professors might still be writing the law review articles but conservatives are writing the laws _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly the most substantive of observations but i couldn t help but notice that clarence thomas one of the three sitting high court justices on hand doesn t exactly inspire confidence with his public appearances _meta_end_dot_

 thomas who is well known for not saying a word during _meta_number_ref_ years of oral arguments probably should start bringing his reticence on the road with him _meta_end_dot_

 lamenting the fact that the senate doesn t let him stack the federal courts with more federalist society members _meta_end_dot_

 well at least bush didn t say it s me _meta_end_exclamation_

 i see myself moving around
