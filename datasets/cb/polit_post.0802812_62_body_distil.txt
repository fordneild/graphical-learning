  on friday the day before barack obama s easy victory in south carolina s presidential primary the nyt noted that the clinton campaign had every intention to keep bill clinton in attack mode that was the day before the primary _meta_end_dot_

 the day after the campaign has come to a very different conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 scaling back however may not be easy _meta_end_dot_

 second as much as i respect and admire bill clinton s many many strengths he s tough to muzzle _meta_end_dot_

 if the plan is to keep him on the campaign trail but as a positive advocate instead of an attack dog there s always the risk that bc will get asked a question about obama and he just won t be able to help himself _meta_end_dot_

 it leads to problems like the one we saw on saturday with bc s jesse jackson comparison which was universally panned as the wrong thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 that said if the campaign is serious about shifting bc s role i think it d be a step in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 from my perspective hrc is a very capable candidate with a compelling campaign pitch _meta_end_dot_

 bc for all he brings to the campaign has begun to distract from his wife s message _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
