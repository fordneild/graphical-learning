  i had no intention of returning to mitt romney s martin luther king story yet again but the former governor is just making this too easy _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing any presidential candidate needs worse yet one with a history of dissembling two weeks before the iowa caucuses is a flap that leads to embarrassing word parsing but that s exactly what romney has here _meta_end_dot_

 oh my _meta_end_dot_

 consider this nine word sentence i saw my father march with martin luther king as of now romney wants to parse the words saw march and with when the questions continued yesterday romney added i m an english literature major _meta_end_dot_

 when we say i saw the patriots win the world series it doesn t necessarily mean you were there as josh marshall said a fter all i ve said about his strengths in the gop nomination race i think mitt owes me a little more than to make a fool of himself like this but no romney chose a different direction one that includes debating the meaning of uncomplicated words _meta_end_dot_

 it even came to this _meta_end_dot_

 yes we re now down to debating the meaning of the word with romney and his campaign really aren t doing themselves any favors here _meta_end_dot_
