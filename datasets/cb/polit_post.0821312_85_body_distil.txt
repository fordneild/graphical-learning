  the mccain campaign s three most recent television ads come together to paint an interesting picture _meta_end_dot_

 over the last week or so ads approved by john mccain have blamed barack obama for high gas prices falsely accused obama of snubbing wounded u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and compared obama to britney spears and paris hilton _meta_end_dot_

 it is of course only july _meta_end_dot_

 taken together the three ads combine to make mccain look desperate or relentlessly negative but there s another adjective that comes to mind small of all the reactions to the campaign s new advertising the most striking came from john weaver _meta_end_dot_

 what s striking about this is that weaver sees mccain as a hero _meta_end_dot_

 an example of american greatness _meta_end_dot_

 a leader with the kind of character to make the nation strong again _meta_end_dot_

 weaver to borrow a phrase is a true believer when it comes to mccain all mccain needs to do is show voters what s in his heart and he ll do just fine _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain has clearly chosen a different path and in the process done something dems have wanted to do for years make mccain appear small self indulgent and rather ordinary _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s david ignatius has a column today wondering where the old admirable mccain disappeared to _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really buy into the notion that mccain is trying to please other people i hold mccain more responsible for his own actions decisions and staff hires but it is interesting to see a growing number of observers argue that mad dog mccain is pretending to be something he is not _meta_end_dot_

 tom edsall also had an interesting report _meta_end_dot_

 someone has no doubt convinced senator small that these tactics will pay off in the end _meta_end_dot_

 he ll have to sell his soul but come january he ll get to be president _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had better hope so because at this point he s losing a presidential race and what s left of his character _meta_end_dot_
