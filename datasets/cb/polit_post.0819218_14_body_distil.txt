  i ve been following john mccain for quite some time but my single favorite mccain story of all time came in march _meta_number_ref_ when the senator was chatting with some reporters aboard his campaign bus _meta_end_dot_

 the subject turned to sexual health and contraception and mccain hadn t the foggiest idea what to say _meta_end_dot_

 asked whether federal grants to education should focus on abstinence only mccain wasn t sure _meta_end_dot_

 asked whether he believes contraceptives help stop the spread of hiv mccain said he had no idea _meta_end_dot_

 asked if contraceptives stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases mccain was dumbfounded looked at the ceiling and urgently motioned for his staff to rescue him _meta_end_dot_

 these weren t trick questions but mccain ended up looking like a fool _meta_end_dot_

 after a quarter century in congress during which time mccain has participated in thousands of policy hearings and has voted on hundreds of bills relating to public health but as a presidential candidate he hasn t the foggiest idea if contraceptives can stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases the subject continues to confound the poor man _meta_end_dot_

 this week carly fiorina a leading mccain advisor surrogate and the republican national committee s victory chairman was discussing consumer driven health insurance when she proposed a real live example which i ve been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but won t cover birth control medication _meta_end_dot_

 those women would like a choice yesterday reporters asked mccain if he agrees with his top advisor there s a very good reason mccain doesn t want to talk about this _meta_end_dot_

 reported mccain voted against a _meta_number_ref_ bill requiring health insurance companies to cover birth control pills as well as viagra so we get confused and bumbling answers like the one in the video _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t watch the clip the wsj described the scene nicely if it sounds to you like some of the reporters were trying to help mccain get out of this we re on the same page _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless let s not lose the forest for the trees here _meta_end_dot_

 sure it s embarrassing that mccain can t answer a fairly easy question on an issue of concern to millions of women _meta_end_dot_

 and sure it s amusing that mccain and one of his top advisors don t agree on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 but the key thing to remember here is that mccain s record on reproductive rights and sexual health is utterly miserable _meta_end_dot_
