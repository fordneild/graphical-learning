  one way or another florida s republican presidential primary was going to answer some key questions _meta_end_dot_

 who s the gop frontrunner _meta_end_question_

 can john mccain win in a state with a primary that excludes independents _meta_end_question_

 could mitt romney capitalize on voters economic fears _meta_end_question_

 would rudy giuliani s fiasco come to a merciful end _meta_end_question_

 all of these questions and more seem considerably clearer this morning _meta_end_dot_

 with just about all of the precincts reporting the final results from florida look like this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ it s worth noting that romney s results were actually pretty impressive _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as a couple of weeks ago he was running fourth in florida behind huckabee mccain and giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to a very aggressive push and a huge investment he closed the gap quickly and came within five points of the upset _meta_end_dot_

 also keep in mind that mccain while winning his first closed primary still struggled to connect with the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 exit polls showed _meta_percent_ref_ of florida gop voters identified themselves as conservative and preferred romney to mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain cruised among republicans who described themselves as moderate or left leaning beating romney among these groups by nearly a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 the result of course is an undisputed frontrunner for the republican nomination _meta_end_dot_

 mccain not only walks away with a hefty _meta_number_ref_ delegate night florida has a winner take all primary but will also enter feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ with its _meta_number_ref_ contests with everything in place to seal the deal _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain what mccain fans are saying that s mister republican frontrunner to you _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain critics are saying are we really stuck with this guy _meta_end_question_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 fans are _meta_end_dot_

 the snowball is rolling getting bigger and picking up steam _meta_end_dot_

 fundraising will pick up republican donors love to bet on a winner and the base will slowly start to resign itself to the political reality _meta_end_dot_

 over the last year the presidential campaign has produced no end of surprising twists and turns and it s possible some still unknown scandal or health problem could pop up but short of that it s hard to see how mccain falters from here on out _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney what romney fans are saying we came this close and could have won if we had a little more time _meta_end_dot_

 what romney critics are saying don t spend too much of that personal fortune mitt because it s not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 well probably both _meta_end_dot_

 watch to see if romney left with no other choices launches a last gasp scorched earth strategy against mccain because staying positive at this point won t help close the gap _meta_end_dot_

 ann romney said last night this is not an end this is a beginning it s hard to see how that s true rudy giuliani what giuliani fans are saying we finally beat ron paul _meta_end_exclamation_

 what giuliani critics are saying don t go away mad rudy just go away _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are as evidenced by the fact that giuliani spoke of his campaign in the past tense during his concession speech last night _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is dropping out today and endorsing mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i ll have more on this in the next post mike huckabee what huckabee fans are saying wouldn t our guy make a great running mate for mccain _meta_end_question_

 what huckabee critics are saying hope you enjoyed your _meta_number_ref_ minutes of fame mike because they re done _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless huckabee is planning to stick around for a while he has nothing else to do which will certainly help mccain in large part because the party s anti mccain conservatives will remain split _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee probably has some intention of competing in southern feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states such as arkansas alabama georgia and tennessee but he won t have the resources to make a serious go at it _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul what paul fans are saying tis but a flesh wound _meta_end_dot_

 what paul critics are saying you re a loony _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 critics are but there s actually a more important question to consider _meta_end_dot_

 paul clearly has no realistic shot at winning any republican contest moving forward and the gop nomination will apparently go to a war supporter with neocon tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 if paul is serious about mounting a third party effort he ll have to get started very soon _meta_end_dot_
