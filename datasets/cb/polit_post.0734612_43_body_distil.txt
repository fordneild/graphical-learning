  between cia revelations months of reports detainee testimony and john kiriakou s very public comments there is no longer a question as to whether bush administration officials used waterboarding to torture suspects _meta_end_dot_

 but the white house can t concede reality because a the bush gang has to maintain the fiction that it opposes torture and b torture is still illegal _meta_end_dot_

 it led to an abbott and costello like press briefing with dana perino yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 a reporter asked whether the questioning of abu zubaydah conformed with the interrogation program approved by president bush perino would only say all have been done within the legal framework that was set out after september _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 the entire program has been legal after the obligatory the united states does not torture we saw this exchange _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 we know u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials used waterboarding perino wants us to know u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials techniques were legal but she doesn t want us to connect point a to point b _meta_end_dot_

 she can t say waterboarding is legal it s not she can t say it s illegal it is so she can t say anything coherent at all _meta_end_dot_

 reason perino won t comment on waterboarding is because get this terrorists might be listening to the white house press briefing _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately the press corps didn t find this persuasive either _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point it s already been spoken about publicly _meta_end_dot_

 at great length _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a secret it s a torture technique developed during the spanish inquisition and prosecuted by previous administrations as a war crime _meta_end_dot_

 it s in the news it s in congressional hearings it s even in presidential debates _meta_end_dot_

 so what on earth is dana perino talking about _meta_end_question_
