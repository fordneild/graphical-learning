  one need not be a campaign insider to recognize before last night s debate in new hampshire what the leading democratic candidates were likely to try to do _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama entered the debate riding an iowa driven wave and would stay positive while avoiding any momentum killing gaffes _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards was likely to take a few rhetorical shots at hillary clinton in the hopes of making this a two man contest _meta_end_dot_

 clinton would want to highlight her competence and experience and get in some digs at obama _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense all three largely accomplished what they set out to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 obama showed a little more policy depth than he has in previous debates and avoided mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 edwards took on clinton characterizing her as the candidate of the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton demonstrated policy chops while rolling out some new attacks on obama _meta_end_dot_

 was any of this game changing _meta_end_question_

 probably not but it was actually a pretty good debate _meta_end_dot_

 now there was one exchange that stood out and which everyone who watched will remember _meta_end_dot_

 before getting to the clip let s set the stage _meta_end_dot_

 clinton had just characterized obama as some kind of flip flopper on healthcare it was frankly a bit of stretch as arguments go _meta_end_dot_

 obama responded and explained why clinton was mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 edwards jumped in rallying to obama s defense _meta_end_dot_

 any time you speak out powerfully for change the forces of status quo attack edwards said _meta_end_dot_

 that s exactly what happens _meta_end_dot_

 w hat will occur every time he speaks out for change every time i fight for change the forces of status quo are going to attack _meta_end_dot_

 every single time _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t hear these kinds of attacks from senator clinton when she was ahead _meta_end_dot_

 now that she s not we hear them clinton visibly annoyed pushed back _meta_end_dot_

 in a campaign season filled with rorschach tests this was a doozy _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand clinton some have argued became too aggressive _meta_end_dot_

 the more she fought the more defensive she became and the closer she came to losing her temper _meta_end_dot_

 immediately after the debate the clinton campaign distributed youtube links to her best moments from the debate and this wasn t in the list but the republican national committee distributed its own youtube links and this did make the rnc s list _meta_end_dot_

 folks can certainly draw their own conclusions about impassioned vs _meta_end_dot_

 shrill but i was struck by something clinton said not just how she said it we don t need to be raising the false hopes of our country regardless of tone or theatrics that s really not a positive message particularly with a group of voters looking to be inspired _meta_end_dot_

 other random observations from my notes wmur s scott spradling the co moderator for the debate referred at one point to edwards and obama double teaming clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen similar comments elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what this is in reference to edwards went after clinton but i didn t see obama going after clinton at all _meta_end_dot_

 i was disappointed that clinton implicitly compared obama to bush you know in _meta_number_ref_ we unfortunately ended up with a president who people said they wanted to have a beer with who said he wanted to be a uniter not a divider who said that he had his intuition and he was going to you know really come into the white house and transform the country _meta_end_dot_

 and you know at least i think there are the majority of americans who think that was not the right choice in context this was in response to a point about obama s likability _meta_end_dot_

 someone can love obama or they can hate him but comparing him to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is just about the ultimate in democratic insults and in this case completely unfounded _meta_end_dot_

 towards the end of the debate clinton dismissed the significance of speeches _meta_end_dot_

 obama defended the power of language the truth is actually words do inspire _meta_end_dot_

 words do help people get involved _meta_end_dot_

 words do help members of congress get into power so that they can be part of a coalition to deliver health care reform to deliver a bold energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 don t discount that power because when the american people are determined that something is going to happen then it happens richardson responded immediately afterwards you know this is the kind of washington bickering that the public turns off i have no idea what richardson was referring to given that no one was actually bickering _meta_end_dot_

 all in all i d have a hard time picking a clear winner john edwards was as good as i ve seen him in any debate obama was very good presidential and might have helped convince some skeptics who questioned whether he knew his stuff richardson was repetitive and disjointed and clinton did exactly what she hoped to do _meta_end_dot_

 so what d you think _meta_end_question_
