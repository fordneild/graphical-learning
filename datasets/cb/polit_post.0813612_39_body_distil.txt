  while there have been plenty of polls suggesting john mccain would enjoy more support from elderly voters than barack obama i ve taken some solace in the fact that very few voters in any age group realize just how wrong mccain is about social security _meta_end_dot_

 for voters over a certain age it has the potential to be quite a political problem _meta_end_dot_

 compounding the problem of course is that mccain seems to have trouble keeping track of what his position on social security is _meta_end_dot_

 take his interview this morning on live with regis and kelly regis philbin isn t exactly known as a tough questioner but this exchange was interesting first mccain s factual claims are just odd _meta_end_dot_

 social security isn t going broke what s more he doesn t believe in privatization but rather wants workers to take their money out of the social security system and into private accounts _meta_end_dot_

 this as far as mccain is concerned is not privatization _meta_end_dot_

 second the mccain campaign can t seem to settle on one consistent position on the policy _meta_end_dot_

 in a different direction _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the change mccain rejected his own campaign s social security policy _meta_end_dot_

 i m totally in favor of personal savings accounts _meta_end_dot_

 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines that president bush proposed when reminded that his campaign website says something completely different mccain said his site would be changed _meta_end_dot_

 two and a half months later the site remains the same _meta_end_dot_

 as a result mccain and his campaign have taken completely different positions on the issue with the candidate embracing the same policy pushed by bush which americans rejected overwhelmingly _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder what seniors in florida are going to think about this _meta_end_question_
