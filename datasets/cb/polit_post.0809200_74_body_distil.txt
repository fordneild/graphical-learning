  like her poll numbers hillary clinton s campaign finances have seen some ups and downs _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign looked to be in good shape in december but then struggled a few months ago prompting clinton to make a _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan to herself _meta_end_dot_

 after the media highlighted the campaign s troubles clinton donors rallied and seemingly put the campaign back on track though by the end of february it looked as if team clinton was operating in the red again _meta_end_dot_

 with this background in mind reports about the campaign failing to pay its bills are only going to feed the perception that the clinton operation has financial troubles _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to push off paying high priced consultants clinton reportedly owes mark penn _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million but the campaign s problems are more noteworthy because they affect small businesses many of which have employees who seem quite annoyed that their bills have so far gone unpaid _meta_end_dot_

 complicating matters the politico added today that among the campaign s debts are unpaid health insurance premiums for clinton s campaign staff _meta_end_dot_

 i m still trying to decide though whether stories like this have an impact or not _meta_end_dot_

 that said as far as public relations are concerned this probably isn t the kind of story the clinton team welcomes _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand it makes it appear as the campaign isn t looking out for small businesses and on the other hand this is a point at which the clinton team is anxious to prove to the party and its donors that the campaign is strong and prepared for the long haul _meta_end_dot_

 stories with the word deadbeat in the lede aren t helpful at all _meta_end_dot_
