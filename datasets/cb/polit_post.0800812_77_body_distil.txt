  the brookings institution s michael o hanlon a supporter of bush s iraq policy who was advising hillary clinton s presidential campaign has been wrong about the war pretty consistently since well the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t seem to stop him from weighing in on the issue at every available opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 in his latest salvo o hanlon takes on barack obama s opposition to the war in a wall street journal piece yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon accuses obama of not being inclusive enough because he rejects the pro war arguments of people like o hanlon _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon concludes that obama should consider non ideological nonpartisan wisdom which presumably would lead the senator to agree with o hanlon _meta_end_dot_

 this is all wildly unpersuasive _meta_end_dot_

 look it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this argument is over _meta_end_dot_

 it s been over for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 re litigating the now obvious mistake of invading iraq is more than just silly it s useless _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon still wants to debate how close saddam was to get nuclear weapons _meta_end_question_

 now _meta_end_question_

 brian katulis added if there s a silver lining to this it s the realization that should obama win the presidential race in november there s no way on earth he ll hire o hanlon for a job in the administration _meta_end_dot_
