  ok new rule for democratic presidential campaigns unhelpful praise for john mccain should from now on be off limits _meta_end_dot_

 sure the candidates may get along well with mccain and mccain may be a nice guy to hang out with but this is a partisan exercise and a zero sum game _meta_end_dot_

 as much as i love the big dog there s just no reason to make things easier on mccain with comments like these _meta_end_dot_

 no no no _meta_end_dot_

 assuming the quotes weren t taken out of context abc news has screwed over clinton with this before clinton s comments were wrong on the merits and the wrong strategic message _meta_end_dot_

 substantively mccain isn t a moderate he doesn t even claim to be a moderate _meta_end_dot_

 it s a media myth that dems are trying to knock down not reinforce _meta_end_dot_

 as for mccain on torture and global warming he s let everyone down on both recently as he s moved further and further to the right _meta_end_dot_

 dems need to remind people why mccain is wrong on these issues not suggesting he may be right _meta_end_dot_

 and strategically having one of the leading democratic candidate s top surrogates complimenting mccain in a key battleground state really doesn t seem like a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is playing for the other team _meta_end_dot_

 raising his positives right now is the opposite of what dems hope to do _meta_end_dot_

 hillary seemed to be on the right track on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 i agree it wouldn t be wise at all _meta_end_dot_

 but that s all the more reason to avoid calling him a moderate who breaks with republicans on key policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 here s a tip to the campaigns if you re going to say something nice about mccain do so in such a way as to subtly criticize him at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 for example barack obama has on a variety of occasions called mccain a genuine american hero who represents the politics of yesterday you re getting the nice part in there genuine hero while also staying on message politics of yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is poised to go to great lengths to tell voters he has a mainstream ideology and doesn t always toe the party line _meta_end_dot_

 for dems to help him make this case simply doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_
