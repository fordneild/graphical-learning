  in a bizarre ruling a narrow supreme court majority decided last year that americans who face wage discrimination only have _meta_number_ref_ days to challenge the initial discrimination in court _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if your employer is paying you less money for equal work and you don t find about the discrepancy until seven months after the problem began you can t contest this in court _meta_end_dot_

 the house already passed a measure to improve workers rights in this area and the senate was poised to do the same _meta_end_dot_

 a bipartisan majority supported the legislation but they couldn t overcome republican obstructionism _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the final roll call the measure had the support of _meta_number_ref_ senators harry reid switched his vote for procedural reasons giving him the ability to bring the bill back to the floor before the end of the session _meta_end_dot_

 every democrat and both independents lieberman and sanders supported the measure along with six republicans four of whom coleman collins smith and sununu are facing tough re election fights this year _meta_end_dot_

 what a remarkable coincidence republicans sure do get more moderate on good legislation when they re worried about losing their seats _meta_end_dot_

 as for the rest of the republican caucus they relied on some pretty ridiculous arguments to oppose the bill _meta_end_dot_

 this one was especially striking _meta_end_dot_

 well actually yes _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point if american workers are facing unjust wage discrimination they should be more lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 those are worthwhile lawsuits challenging an injustice _meta_end_dot_

 ideally employers would stop discriminating and in turn there d be fewer lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 it s about creating an incentive _meta_end_dot_

 as for the politics of this both hillary clinton and barack obama came back to the senate to vote for and speak out on behalf of this legislation _meta_end_dot_

 and what about john mccain _meta_end_question_

 he didn t show up for work again but he made a point of telling reporters he s against the legislation in new orleans today mccain explained his opposition to the bill by claiming it opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems he added that instead of legislation allowing women to fight for equal pay they simply need education and training it s almost as if he doesn t want women to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 one last thought was this bill really worth filibustering _meta_end_question_

 was the legislation so offensive to the republican minority that they couldn t even allow an up or down vote on a measure to protect pay equality in the workplace _meta_end_question_

 or did a bunch of corporate lobbyists show up at republican lawmakers offices demanding that they shut this down _meta_end_question_
