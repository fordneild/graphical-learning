  it makes perfect sense that the mccain campaign would make at least cursory efforts to reach out to hillary clinton s most ardent supporters _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain does after all have very little to lose _meta_end_dot_

 there are some lingering hard feelings after the longest and closest democratic presidential primary ever and even though the intra party factions agree on everything and share a common agenda mccain hopes to convince a few dems that his ideas vision issue positions platform and voting record are completely irrelevant in a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 as far as mccain is concerned if it works great he ll be the first conservative republican to succeed with the support of liberal democrats _meta_end_dot_

 if it doesn t work mccain might score a few points with independents who appreciate his outreach _meta_end_dot_

 either way it s time well spent _meta_end_dot_

 but in his drive to divide dems mccain has once again embraced the role of con man _meta_end_dot_

 mccain of course is anxious to stack the federal judiciary with very conservative jurists _meta_end_dot_

 asked about this last night mccain assured clinton supporters that he supported bill clinton with both ginsburg and breyer similarly when asked about marriage equality for gay couples one attendee said mccain explained that his position is the same as john kerry s position in other words in attempting to divide democrats mccain has decided to try blatant deception and hope clinton supporters don t know the difference _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason on earth to think this will work _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of clinton supporters are disappointed and resentful but they re not crazy _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even pointing to these two votes is a classic red herring _meta_end_dot_

 the question isn t whether mccain voted to confirm qualified judges nominated by a democratic president the question is what mccain will do to the judiciary if he s the president _meta_end_dot_

 we already know the answer to that question because mccain has told us over and over again of his deeply held desire to make the courts even more conservative than they are now _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain is telling anyone who will listen that he d be even further to the right than bush on this issue subtly criticizing griswold and by extension the very notion of a right to privacy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain did after all champion robert bork s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 might he really be a maverick when it comes to the supreme court _meta_end_question_

 the answer almost certainly is no _meta_end_dot_

 the senator has long touted his opposition to roe and has voted for every one of bush s judicial appointments the rhetoric of his speech shows that he is getting his advice on the court from the most extreme elements of the conservative movement what s more mccain will not only replace supreme court justices but also lower court judges and entire executive branch bureaucracy with conservative republican officials _meta_end_dot_

 how conservative is mccain on judges _meta_end_question_

 even joe lieberman has expressed concerns about mccain and the judiciary and i refuse to believe that resentful clinton supporters are to lieberman s right on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 as for gay rights for mccain to equate his position with john kerry s is utterly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 kerry supports civil unions mccain doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 kerry supports allowing gay americans to serve openly in the military mccain doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 hell mccain actively supported and campaigned for an amendment to arizona s constitution that would ban gay marriages and deny government benefits to unmarried couples similar to kerry _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday a long time friend of the blog who was largely sympathetic to clinton during the primaries noted that these hard feelings in democratic circles are a personal emotional thing he argued that it s a mistake to reason with strong feelings fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 emotional reactions often don t make sense emotions sometimes even lead people to make horrible mistakes that they later regret _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case mccain is trying to reason with strong feelings by perpetrating a fraud pretending to be something he s not _meta_end_dot_

 i m hard pressed to imagine anyone who was smart enough to be a progressive democrat being foolish enough to fall for such a transparent scam _meta_end_dot_
