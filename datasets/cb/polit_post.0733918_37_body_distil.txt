  at yesterday s white house press conference a reporter asked the president for his thoughts in response to americans concerns about the state of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 your administration is considering a plan to help people out with their mortgage payments the reporter said but i wonder if there s anything else beyond that that you ve got in mind after a rambling answer that emphasized a trade deal with peru bush concluded this reminded me of a good piece jonathan chait recently had in tnr _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts according to the white house bush s congressional allies and most of the political world are the appropriate solution for a weak economy a strong economy a large deficit and large surplus and presumably the common cold _meta_end_dot_

 but a small dose of reality makes clear that bush s talking points are wrong _meta_end_dot_

 so clinton raised taxes bush lowered them _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s economy soared bush s economy didn t _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s deficits disappeared bush s deficits blossomed _meta_end_dot_

 now republicans will argue reasonably that this is an overly simplistic view of what transpired _meta_end_dot_

 the president s tax policies the right will no doubt insist do not necessarily have a direct effect on the nation s broader economic health _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point bush says any kind of tax increase now would take an economy that s already slowing down and bring it to a full halt _meta_end_dot_

 except as chait noted that doesn t make any sense especially given the gop s rationalization of clinton s successes _meta_end_dot_

 conservative arguments fundamentally depend on denying a lot of things this is just keeping with the trend _meta_end_dot_
