  a week ago newsweek asked john mccain about remarks he made during his infamous widely panned lime jell o speech near new orleans in which he criticized the media for not having been fair enough to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 when newsweek brought it up mccain immediately denied it i did not say that that was in prepared remarks and i did not say it i m not in the business of commenting on the press and their coverage or not coverage the problem of course was that mccain was confused _meta_end_dot_

 his media criticism was in his prepared remarks and mccain read the words out loud _meta_end_dot_

 we d all just heard his speech and it was kind of disturbing to hear mccain deny having said what we all knew he d just told a national audience _meta_end_dot_

 the emphatic denial suggested mccain had no idea what was in his own speech _meta_end_dot_

 the incident wasn t too big a deal but it raised questions about mccain s honesty memory and state of mind _meta_end_dot_

 discussing the incident the other day on countdown there was an interesting exchange between keith olbermann and newsweek s jonathan alter _meta_end_dot_

 alter said i think this largely right _meta_end_dot_

 it s an odd defense for mccain s casual relationship with the truth but it s probably a reasonable enough explanation of why he keeps saying things that demonstrably false _meta_end_dot_

 put it quite right _meta_end_dot_

 it s not so much that mccain wants to intentionally deceive people though he does occasionally do just that but rather mccain just isn t accustomed to caring about details _meta_end_dot_

 he came of age in a time when political leaders could just say whatever came to mind _meta_end_dot_

 telling stories sharing anecdotes relaying experiences mccain likes to make a point but he doesn t like to worry about pesky particulars like facts _meta_end_dot_

 he can flub details here or there with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 who s going to know _meta_end_question_

 well under the new rules everyone is going to know _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t know what google is and what s worse he doesn t know that the rest of us do know what google is _meta_end_dot_

 it helps explain why mccain is constantly committing gaffes he s just not accustomed to caring about facts _meta_end_dot_

 worse it s a little late in the game to teach a septuagenarian presidential candidate to change _meta_end_dot_
