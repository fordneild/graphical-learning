  left with little else to say the mccain campaign started attacking the media this week accusing reporters of going easy on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 frank rich found this rather laughable noting the press still gives free passes to its old bus mate john mccain but let s take this one step further and consider a more quantifiable look at the phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives tend to think reality has a well known liberal bias but as it turns out the media doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 most of the reporting from the evening news was opinion free but when on air media personalities strayed _meta_percent_ref_ of the statements about obama were positive while _meta_percent_ref_ was negative _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast _meta_percent_ref_ of the statements about mccain were positive while _meta_percent_ref_ was negative _meta_end_dot_

 in other words network reporting was tilted against both major party candidates but obama faced a far more hostile environment than the barbecue offering donut receiving mccain _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have been emphasizing that obama has been getting far more coverage than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out that s true _meta_end_dot_

 but if most of the coverage of obama is negative the mccain campaign should probably quit its whining and start sending producers thank you notes and gift baskets _meta_end_dot_

 one assumes the right will respond to this report by trashing the center for media and public affairs no doubt labeling it a liberal propaganda outlet _meta_end_dot_

 so let s preemptively set the record straight the center is run by robert lichter a favorite of right wing clowns like glenn beck and bill o reilly _meta_end_dot_
