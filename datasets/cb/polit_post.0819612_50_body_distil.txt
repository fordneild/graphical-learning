  you d think at this point in the presidential race that mccain campaign surrogates would be prepped on how to answer some of the easy obvious questions such as are there any differences between bush and mccain on economic policy this came up in may when rep _meta_end_dot_

 roy blunt r mo the second highest ranking republican in the house was asked to name a difference and he couldn t come up with one _meta_end_dot_

 it came up again in june when sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c couldn t think of any differences either _meta_end_dot_

 and it was especially amusing to see this clip from cnn yesterday for those who can t watch clips online cnn s wolf blitzer asked campaign surrogate and south carolina gov _meta_end_dot_

 mark sanford r a man rumored to be a vp possibility for john mccain are there any significant economic differences between what the bush administration has put forward over these many years as opposed to now what john mccain supports it a painful display sanford hemmed and hawed for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 i mean for instance take you know take for instance the issue of i m drawing a blank and i hate it when i do that particularly on television he said before adding but take for instance the contrast on nafta when blitzer noted that bush and mccain have identical policies on trade sanford said he was making a point about an area of disagreement between mccain and barack obama _meta_end_dot_
