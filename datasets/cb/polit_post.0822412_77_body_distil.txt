  as part of his new found interest in appearing independent again john mccain and his aides like to remind folks about his role in taking on jack abramoff the disgraced republican lobbyist _meta_end_dot_

 it s not an entirely unreasonable pitch mccain did some decent work on the scandal in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is bragging about his role now and that s probably appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 at least it was _meta_end_dot_

 in an inexplicable move even by republican standards mccain has decided to cozy up to ralph reed the disgraced right wing activist and abramoff business partner _meta_end_dot_

 the atlanta journal constitution s jim galloway has this jaw dropper by the time john mccain cozied up to jerry falwell after falwell blamed americans for the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks it was pretty obvious that mccain would embrace literally anyone if he thought he could get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain shouldn t get away with befriending ralph reed _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s been a couple of years and mccain can be a little forgetful but the abramoff scandal left reed a humiliated disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t just some embarrassing misunderstanding the scandal ruined him _meta_end_dot_

 permanently _meta_end_dot_

 remember this one from june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 or how about this one _meta_end_question_

 or this _meta_end_question_

 mccain knows all of this _meta_end_dot_

 mccain helped document all of this _meta_end_dot_

 and yet now we have reed hosting a fundraiser for mccain in atlanta _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t think mccain could stoop this low _meta_end_dot_

 i underestimated his cravenness _meta_end_dot_
