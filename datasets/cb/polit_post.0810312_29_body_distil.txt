  gallup released a poll this week that offered barack obama some good news and some bad all relating to an education gap as jonathan chait noted obama s lead over clinton among white college educated democrats and democratic leaners has risen from _meta_number_ref_ points to _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 among those with post graduate degrees it s exploded from an _meta_number_ref_ point lead to a _meta_number_ref_ point lead _meta_end_dot_

 but among white voters with a high school degree or less his deficit has barely budged from _meta_number_ref_ points to _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 as it stands the educational chasm is stark if obama is struggling with the working class blues something tells me this won t help _meta_end_dot_

 the response could fairly be described as ferocious _meta_end_dot_

 almost immediately john mccain s campaign told reporters it shows an elitism and condescension towards hardworking americans that is nothing short of breathtaking _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to imagine someone running for president who is more out of touch with average americans hillary clinton nearly as quickly delivered a speech in which she said people who ve faced hard times are not bitter at all adding pennsylvanians don t need a president who looks down on them they need a president who stands up for them i think obama s remarks from last weekend were a little clumsy but hardly scandalous _meta_end_dot_

 here s the contentious quote in a slightly larger context for those of us who ve read what s the matter with kansas _meta_end_question_

 the quote probably doesn t sound especially noteworthy _meta_end_dot_

 awkwardly phrased but largely a common explanation for the ways in which voters place social concerns and the culture war above their economic interests _meta_end_dot_

 reading over obama s quote a few times i get the sense he ran into trouble by putting two thoughts together without any real transition _meta_end_dot_

 the god and guns idea isn t exactly the same as the america first idea though they re part of the same broader dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless there are two main angles to consider going forward _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that after a slow week in which nothing especially shocking happened in the presidential campaign this is the new new thing the media will now obsess over accusations of elitism in part because clinton and the gop have settled on the same talking points and in part because the media has nothing else to do right now _meta_end_dot_

 the story broke late on a friday night but the discussion will dominate the sunday morning shows and fox news will incorporate the comments into every segment between now and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the second is that obama did a pretty good job in indiana last night of pushing back on the story _meta_end_dot_

 to my ear this provides important context and meaning to what obama said on sunday though the comments are not identical _meta_end_dot_

 last night was effectively his way of saying what i meant was that may work it may not _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_

 if recent history is any guide the bitter quote won t change anything _meta_end_dot_

 people sympathetic to obama won t find this especially noteworthy and are inclined to agree with his sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 obama s detractors will characterize his remarks as evidence of liberal elitism _meta_end_dot_

 we can discuss at painful length whether people are actually bitter or optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 or both _meta_end_dot_

 or something else altogether _meta_end_dot_
