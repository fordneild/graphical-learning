  well i ve finally seen everything _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain who enjoys more media affection than any political figure in recent memory has taken to complaining that reporters are overly fond of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the video is a three minute montage the mccain campaign put together with evidence of the media s pro obama bias _meta_end_dot_

 most of the clip is made up of comments from chris matthews and remarks from various surrogates for the clinton campaign during the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 the release of the video is part of a new contest the mccain campaign has launched under the headline the media is in love with barack the contest apparently is for republicans to pick the best song to capture the media s devotion to obama _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s possible for the mccain campaign to come up with a more ridiculous hypocritical line of attack but it s hard to imagine what that might be _meta_end_dot_

 honestly hearing the mccain campaign whine about someone getting fawning media coverage is a bit like hearing barry bonds accuse someone getting an unfair advantage by abusing steroids _meta_end_dot_

 look i don t doubt that there are some media personalities who are inclined to support obama _meta_end_dot_

 there clearly are _meta_end_dot_

 but to suggest that obama has benefited more from media bias than mccain is insane _meta_end_dot_

 news outlets hammered obama relentlessly on the meaningless rezko story _meta_end_dot_

 and nafta gate and the alleged plagiarism when videos surfaced of jeremiah wright s sermons every network put them into constant rotation practically every day for months _meta_end_dot_

 when videos surfaced of radical televangelists associated with mccain the media took a pass _meta_end_dot_

 when obama opted out of the public financing system the media went ballistic _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain violated campaign finance law the media took a pass _meta_end_dot_

 when obama said he would continue to refine his policy on iraq the media spent nearly three weeks screaming flip flopper when mccain completely reinvented himself and flip flopped on everything under the sun the media praised mccain as a maverick when obama attended a conference of the nation s newspaper editors ap chairman dean singleton quizzed obama about whether he would send more troops to afghanistan where obama bin laden is still at large when mccain attended the same conference ap reporters brought him his favorite donuts and a cup of coffee made just the way he likes it _meta_end_dot_

 the media has deemed mccain s scandalous personal life off limits _meta_end_dot_

 and questions about mccain s national security incompetence _meta_end_dot_

 and questions about the _meta_number_ref_ years remark _meta_end_dot_

 and the keating five scandal _meta_end_dot_

 dems can t even use the word confused without reporters accusing them of attacking mccain s age _meta_end_dot_

 once in a while reporters have even admitted that mccain gets less scrutiny than everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has on more than one occasion referring to the national press corps as his base for crying out loud a detailed book was recently published chronicling the astoundingly biased coverage mccain has enjoyed for years _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain wants to complain that the media favors obama _meta_end_question_

 is the mccain campaign completely out of their minds _meta_end_question_

 i m reminded of this brilliant item amanda at tp had last month in which she noted that no matter what happens the media finds a way to defend mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the chutzpah of the mccain campaign is truly limitless _meta_end_dot_
