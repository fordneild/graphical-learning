  the reality is the punishment was never really supposed to matter _meta_end_dot_

 florida and michigan were breaking the party s rules by moving their primaries up and they were willing to accept the dnc s punishment as a consequence but everyone acted with a wink and a nod once a candidate emerged in the primaries as the nominee the states delegates would get seated anyway _meta_end_dot_

 of course given the state of the competition it s obviously not working out that way _meta_end_dot_

 how to proceed has quickly become a dominant point of discussion in democratic circles _meta_end_dot_

 obviously because the rule breaking states would be a huge boon to her campaign clinton wants to scrap the punishment and have her victories honored even if it means changing the rules in the middle of the game _meta_end_dot_

 the more likely scenarios seem to involve a second round of contests in florida and michigan that would count _meta_end_dot_

 though there s considerable disagreement about how do over contests would be paid for the clinton camp as of yesterday signaled that they were open to a revote under certain conditions harold ickes a top clinton adviser told the nyt we haven t ruled out rerunning these contests his boss however may feel differently _meta_end_dot_

 the opposite position _meta_end_dot_

 it s a little hard to know for sure how inflexible clinton may be on this point _meta_end_dot_

 her comments to u s _meta_end_dot_

 news came on wednesday and her campaign was saying something very different yesterday when intra party discussions began in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible clinton s remarks on wednesday were just bravado and that she s more open to negotiation than she let on _meta_end_dot_

 that said i suspect she d continue to oppose caucuses under any circumstances given that she almost always loses caucuses as opposed to primaries the fight over money meanwhile is no small matter _meta_end_dot_

 the states don t want to foot the bill for another contest and the dnc can t afford it _meta_end_dot_

 caucuses would be considerably cheaper but clinton won t want to take the risk _meta_end_dot_

 what a mess _meta_end_dot_
