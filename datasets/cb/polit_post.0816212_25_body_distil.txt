  considering how worked up john mccain gets if anyone confronts him with his _meta_number_ref_ years comments on iraq it s odd that he continues to articulate a policy of indefinite war _meta_end_dot_

 the jed report highlighted this clip from last night s nbc nightly news for those who can t watch clips online brian williams asks the videotape clip of your comment about being in iraq _meta_number_ref_ years if need be of course is still kicking around _meta_end_dot_

 you ve since given a speech to more closely define your position on iraq but given your support for the surge and where you believe this nation is in iraq today where do you see it going and will your support be there for however many u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops are required mccain replied yes _meta_end_dot_

 and the fact is we are winning in iraq in other words mccain s policy for iraq is to stay the course indefinitely with as many troops and resources as required _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough that was also his policy in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and come to think of it _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 just keep doing what bush has been doing and wait for it to work _meta_end_dot_

 every step of the way when asked just say that the policy is either working or winning and hope no one looks too closely to see if that s right _meta_end_dot_

 of course this isn t a policy it s a joke _meta_end_dot_

 already confused about how many troops are currently in iraq is that we should be prepared to leave troops in iraq for up to a century after the war ends _meta_end_dot_

 but how long do we keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq during the war _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out that s indefinite too _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of a recent piece from ron brownstein who explained why it s incumbent on mccain to go into a little more detail _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hasn t been able to answer either question _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t even tried _meta_end_dot_

 he has argued that after the war without end is over and u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops remain in a stable iraq for generations their mission would be to deter external aggression the same way american troops are in south korea to prevent north korea from getting any ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t work in iraq s case either _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hates the _meta_number_ref_ years talk because as he sees it the discussion removes the context _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain can t offer any context with depth because he doesn t really have a policy _meta_end_dot_

 so what are we left with _meta_end_question_

 mccain s approach is to fight an indefinite war followed by an indefinite military presence _meta_end_dot_

 as he sees it hopefully the iraqis will reconcile and hopefully iraq will become stable and then hopefully they won t mind if we stick around for a generation or five while we keep their allies at bay _meta_end_dot_

 and remember americans are supposed to believe that foreign policy and national security are mccain s strengths _meta_end_dot_
