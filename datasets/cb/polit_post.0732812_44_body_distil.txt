  guest post by morbo a few years ago my daughter and i read the golden compass the first volume of british author philip pullman s trilogy titled his dark materials we moved on to the second book but never finished it _meta_end_dot_

 now i m thinking we made a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 a movie version of the first book opens dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and the religious right is throwing a fit _meta_end_dot_

 if the religious right does not like this series it must be worth looking at _meta_end_dot_

 baptist press bp an arm of the southern baptist convention is warning christians about the film and the books _meta_end_dot_

 bp notes that the series is very popular and is marketed to school aged children through the scholastic books firm _meta_end_dot_

 naturally this being the united states some of the more controversial themes of the series have been toned down in the film version _meta_end_dot_

 but bp still warns that interest in the movie will lead more kids to the books and from there straight to hell _meta_end_dot_

 the southern baptist convention is the largest protestant denomination in america _meta_end_dot_

 while there are many fine southern baptist in this country who still hold to the baptist view that separation of church and state is a good and necessary thing the leadership long ago went over to the jerry falwell camp _meta_end_dot_

 in washington d c the southern baptist lobbying office operates more or less as a religious right group _meta_end_dot_

 these folks need to take a deep breath _meta_end_dot_

 likewise millions of children read the harry potter series which fundamentalists have also attacked _meta_end_dot_

 the final potter book was published in the summer _meta_end_dot_

 christianity appears to have survived _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood is in odd place these days _meta_end_dot_

 after the success of the passion of the christ some executives got the idea that maybe there was something to these religious movies after all and green lighted a number of other pious projects _meta_end_dot_

 they have not done as well but they do serve a niche market _meta_end_dot_

 now a movie is coming out that might be critical of religion although to me it sounds like the overt criticism has been removed _meta_end_dot_

 in the film the church is called the magisterium chances are most kids will look at this movie as a cool adventure story with nifty special effects _meta_end_dot_

 the book features armor plated bears flying witches and all kinds of interesting characters adults who see it might pick up on an anti religious message but chances are those folks have already made up their minds about god _meta_end_dot_

 in short if your faith is so weak that it can be shaken by a film adaptation of a kid lit book it wasn t of much use to begin with _meta_end_dot_
