  ok one more thing about wednesday night s democratic debate and then i ll let it go _meta_end_dot_

 determining which of the discussion topics was the most inane is tricky but i d have to go with the flag lapel pin question _meta_end_dot_

 early on in the debate charlie gibson said he wanted to offer a question that goes to the basic issue of electability gibson said i t is a question raised by a voter in latrobe pennsylvania a woman by the name of nash mccabe from videotape mccabe then asked obama if he believe s in the american flag and why he doesn t wear the flag for abc this offers a little distance from the trivia the moderators didn t ask about lapel pins some regular ol person did _meta_end_dot_

 i had assumed that abc went around western pennsylvania looking for voters with good questions and thought mccabe s was provocative _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not quite what happened _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of weeks ago mccabe told the new york times that she can t back obama _meta_end_dot_

 how can i vote for a president who won t wear a flag pin the recently unemployed clerk typist said _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall explained presumably a researcher for abc or gibson saw the piece in the times figured hey this lady hates obama and is seriously ginned up about the lapel issue _meta_end_dot_

 let s send a camera crew and film her slamming obama to his face _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be great in the debate or as will bunch put it yes but the claim isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 closer look at mccabe s circumstances and found a very sad story _meta_end_dot_

 ironically she sounds like one of the frustrated small town voters obama has been reaching out to for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps if abc news had focused a little more on mccabe s economic circumstances and a little less on her flag pin interest we may have been able to learn something useful in the debate _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting that the original nyt article that quoted mccabe and made her interesting to reporters wasn t about questioned patriotism it was about racial attitudes in western pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 it led bunch to conclude
