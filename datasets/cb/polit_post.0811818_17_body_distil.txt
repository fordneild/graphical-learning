  the mccain campaign doesn t seem especially concerned about democratic attacks that he s running to give the nation a third bush term _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t seem to care when people highlight his age _meta_end_dot_

 he shrugs off questions about his reputation as a hothead with a nasty temperament who flies off the handle on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 he couldn t care less when he s caught flip flopping abandoning long held principles or getting confused about the basics of public policy _meta_end_dot_

 but bring up his line about leaving troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years and mccain goes completely apoplectic _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to be the one point of criticism that mccain and his campaign fear most _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately thanks to the republicans coordinated freak out the democratic national committee knew precisely where to poke mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as nico pitney noted the mccain campaign has sent out no less than _meta_number_ref_ emails decrying the use of the _meta_number_ref_ years line by his political opponents but there s nothing in the dnc ad that s false while some at times have falsely suggested that mccain has vowed to keep the war going for _meta_number_ref_ years this commercial just uses the senator s own words _meta_end_dot_

 in a press release unveiling the ad dnc chairman howard dean carefully worded his attack to make sure it s absolutely factual what john mccain doesn t understand is that the american people aren t fine with being in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years in any capacity _meta_end_dot_

 the american people want a president who will responsibly end the war not more of the same failed policy in iraq that continues to cost _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a month _meta_end_dot_

 they want a president who will invest that money here at home to create jobs and ensure our kids have health care _meta_end_dot_

 the more voters learn about john mccain we re confident they will recognize that he is the wrong choice for america s future sounds good to me _meta_end_dot_

 explained a couple of weeks ago no one wants to be in iraq _meta_number_ref_ years from now even if mccain stipulates to the fantasy that iraqis will be happy having us occupy their country forever and that the place will become like finland _meta_end_dot_

 and none of our soldiers will ever get killed there and it won t cost any money _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the explanation for why we shouldn t be concerned that he s happy to stay in iraq for a century that just tells people that mccain is living in a fantasy world second it s an awful policy prescription _meta_end_dot_

 as joe klein recently noted the problem with john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years in iraq formulation isn t that he s calling for _meta_number_ref_ more years of combat he isn t but that he thinks you can have a long term basing arrangement in iraq similar to those we have in germany or korea _meta_end_dot_

 that betrays a fairly acute lack of knowledge about both iraq and islam _meta_end_dot_

 it may well be possible to station u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in small peripheral kingdoms like dubai or kuwait but iraq is and has always been volatile tenuous centrally located and nearly as sensitive to the presence of infidels as saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 it is a terrible candidate for a long term basing agreement _meta_end_dot_

 and third mccain has flip flopped more than once on whether he actually thinks his own idea is any good _meta_end_dot_

 there s simply no reason for democrats to feel even the slightest bit hesitant about using this _meta_end_dot_

 even in its full context mccain has said on multiple occasions that he s comfortable leaving u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for a century or more _meta_end_dot_

 the only way that s even possible is to establish permanent bases which are opposed by both iraqis and americans and which fuel anti american violence _meta_end_dot_

 he said it he meant it and democrats would be insane not to tell voters about it _meta_end_dot_

 and yet mccain and republicans have for several weeks launched a coordinated carefully orchestrated campaign to get people everyone really to stop using the words mccain iraq and _meta_number_ref_ years in the same sentence _meta_end_dot_

 no one can do push back as well as the republican machine and these guys are intent on making it impossible to hit mccain where it hurts _meta_end_dot_

 as such i m delighted the dnc is ignoring the push back and poking the sore spot _meta_end_dot_
