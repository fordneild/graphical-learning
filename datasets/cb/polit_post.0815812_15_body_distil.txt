  one need not look too hard to find talk from hillary clinton supporters who at least for now are prepared to vote for conservative republican john mccain in november _meta_end_dot_

 personally i m pretty confident that this talk is temporary emotions are running high right now but in the coming weeks cooler heads will prevail _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has worked too hard for too long to have her supporters suddenly betray everything she believes in out of some sense of spite _meta_end_dot_

 this is especially important when it comes to women s issues realizing of course that clinton also has millions of supporters who are men _meta_end_dot_

 obviously mccain s intention to move the supreme court even further to the right and overturn roe is high on the list of concerns but scott lemieux had a good item this week reminding us that roe is just part of a bigger picture _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 we re not just talking about esoteric issues like supreme court cases and speculative high court retirements this is about the kind of impact mccain policies can and would have on women s lives every day _meta_end_dot_

 as st _meta_end_dot_

 paul mayor chris coleman an enthusiastic clinton backer said this week you don t spend your life fighting for women s rights and then vote for sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain as it turns out we can even go further on this point _meta_end_dot_

 especially good item this week on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast barack obama and hillary clinton agree on all of these issues _meta_end_dot_

 this really isn t a close call _meta_end_dot_
