  senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ken sat down the wsj s james freeman this week and noted after more than a year of record breaking obstructionism he s rather pleased with himself _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to v s _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip this is sheer nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 the problem has never been that senate republicans judiciously blocked totally awful legislation the problem has been that senate republicans have demanded supermajorities for every bill that moved _meta_end_dot_

 to hear mcconnell tell it the gop caucus has been careful and deliberate about the senate s cloture rules _meta_end_dot_

 what he did not mention and which the wsj ignored is that senate republicans have blocked more bills in _meta_number_ref_ than any previous minority blocked in any two year span in congressional history _meta_end_dot_

 the journal s freeman credits mcconnell for steering bad ideas off the rails but looking back over what was blocked last year it seems by the standards of mcconnell and the wsj editorial board practically all ideas are bad mcconnell is a pretty sleazy character but even for him this is low _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that it s republican supporters of telecom immunity who are looking to get a financial reward not democratic opponents looking for money from the plaintiffs bar _meta_end_dot_

 first the substance _meta_end_dot_

 second the republicans financial motivation _meta_end_dot_

 pointing at dems falsely with one hand while reaching for a telecom handout with the other _meta_end_dot_

 shameless _meta_end_dot_

 simply shameless _meta_end_dot_
