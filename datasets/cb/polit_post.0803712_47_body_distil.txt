  several months ago the political world put a big red ink circle around feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on their calendars _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t just be super tuesday it would be the biggest day in the history of the presidential primary process _meta_end_dot_

 this de facto national primary would answer lingering questions establish a clear frontrunner and let the party shift its focus away from the primaries and onto the general election _meta_end_dot_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 in order for super tuesday to resolve anything there had to be a clear winner _meta_end_dot_

 instead we have two powerful well funded candidates who can both claim credibly that they had very good days _meta_end_dot_

 as walter shapiro put it never before in the long history of presidential politics have so many voters in so many states gone to the polls and their caucus sites on the same day and decided so little looking at the landscape the morning after who won what _meta_end_question_

 as of right now obama won alabama alaska colorado connecticut delaware georgia idaho illinois kansas minnesota missouri north dakota and utah _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won arizona arkansas california massachusetts new york new jersey oklahoma and tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 new mexico for reasons that i don t quite understand is still too close to call and with _meta_percent_ref_ of the precincts reporting obama leads clinton by a few hundred votes _meta_end_dot_

 any way you slice it super tuesday was effectively a tie _meta_end_dot_

 obama won more states _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ but clinton won bigger states four of the five biggest contests _meta_end_dot_

 clinton narrowly won the day s popular vote _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ but obama narrowly won total state populations _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as for the metric that really matters the delegate count it couldn t have been much closer _meta_end_dot_

 according to nbc news chuck todd obama apparently edged clinton in super tuesday delegates _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that number may swing within _meta_number_ref_ delegates in either direction depending on final results in california but either way it s a split decision _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind it comes down to bragging rights and clinton and obama each have compelling pitches bolstered by the results _meta_end_dot_

 from the obama campaign s perspective obama far exceeded expectations _meta_end_dot_

 if you had told the campaign a month ago that on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the senator would walk away with more states won and an edge in delegates staffers would have been delirious with joy _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter even two weeks ago no one seriously believed obama would win _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ super tuesday states but he did _meta_end_dot_

 what s more some had begun to suggest obama could only win in states with large african american minnesota populations _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday however obama won in states like alaska connecticut idaho north dakota and utah all of which are overwhelmingly white _meta_end_dot_

 feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was supposed to be clinton s big day she even claimed publicly a couple of weeks ago that she d nail down the nomination on super tuesday and it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 advantage obama _meta_end_dot_

 and from the clinton campaign s perspective _meta_end_dot_

 obama entered super tuesday with all the momentum and he was poised to score huge wins in competitive states _meta_end_dot_

 that didn t happen clinton won four of the top five biggest contests and the other was obama s home state _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won california by double digits and even won massachusetts despite support from the party establishment kennedy kerry patrick for obama _meta_end_dot_

 with that obama s momentum comes to a screeching halt _meta_end_dot_

 obama may have won more individual contests but six of those wins were in caucus states which minimizes their significance _meta_end_dot_

 as for the delegate count yesterday was effectively a tie but for the year thus far it s clinton who s ahead by about _meta_number_ref_ delegates not obama _meta_end_dot_

 advantage clinton _meta_end_dot_

 which of these spins is right _meta_end_question_

 they both are _meta_end_dot_

 indeed yesterday reinforced suspicions that this competition may very well go all the way to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 neither can put away the other both have lots of money and both have demonstrated an ability to score unexpected victories _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama aren t going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 super tuesday only made that more obvious _meta_end_dot_
