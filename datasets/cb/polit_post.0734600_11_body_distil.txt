  when it comes to the cia s destruction of video footage of u s _meta_end_dot_

 torture of detainees the white house on the advice of counsel has stopped commenting _meta_end_dot_

 at yesterday s press briefing dana perino wouldn t budge _meta_end_dot_

 the president however is in charge and can comment on anything he wants to comment on _meta_end_dot_

 abc news asked bush a few questions about the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably i think it s fair to say we ve reached a point in which most of bush s comments should reflexively be perceived as false particularly when it comes to controversies that are currently under investigation as this one is _meta_end_dot_

 but even beyond the simplistic bush is dishonest tack there s ample reason for skepticism here _meta_end_dot_

 his white house counsel has been aware of them for years _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the bush gang was integrally involved in this process _meta_end_dot_

 now i suspect most reasonable people can agree that bush is probably not much of a micro manager _meta_end_dot_

 just because his senior aides and top intelligence officials knew about the torture and the torture tapes doesn t necessarily mean the president knew anything about them _meta_end_dot_

 even if he was told he likely would have said all right you ve covered your ass now having said that bush was briefed extensively on the zubaydah interrogation featured on one of the destroyed videos and it s hardly a stretch to think one of those briefings might have mentioned that the interrogation was captured on film _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the true facts are dependent on just how clueless the president is about events going on around him _meta_end_dot_
