  when john mccain among others began pushing for a gas tax holiday a couple of months ago economists widely panned the idea as a rather obvious way of boosting oil company profits without offering consumers much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t just mean economists in the general sense the huffington post tried to find an economist anywhere who would endorse mccain s idea _meta_end_dot_

 none turned up _meta_end_dot_

 now mccain has joined the president in pushing a coastal drilling policy as a way to addressing high gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 once again the huffington post tried to find an economist who honestly believes mccain s idea would lower the price of gas _meta_end_dot_

 and as sam stein reported once again it was a futile search _meta_end_dot_

 the best conservative experts could do was point to the possibility of placating speculators who might be impressed with the added exploitation of the coasts to borrow mccain s word _meta_end_dot_

 but even that s wishful thinking _meta_end_dot_

 there are a number of problems with that argument said rob shapiro formerly undersecretary of commerce under president clinton and co founder and chairman of sonecon llc _meta_end_dot_

 first of all i don t think anyone thinks that within the time period of futures trading that there would be enough additional supply to effect global future prices _meta_end_dot_

 second of all the market will look at this not only in terms of there is more supply but also there is more supply at substantial greater costs to recover than current supply and with substantial new liabilities the communities that are going to sue them when they destroy their beaches could we rush new found oil to the market _meta_end_question_

 maybe but it would only lessen the supply _meta_end_dot_

 the faster we try to drain the less efficient the drainage said dr _meta_end_dot_

 ralph byrns professor of economics at unc chapel hill _meta_end_dot_

 if we drain it dry and still get _meta_number_ref_ billion barrels of oil the president has suggested _meta_number_ref_ billion that itself would still take _meta_number_ref_ years so we agree right _meta_end_question_

 coastal drilling does not lead to lower prices at least not anytime soon and probably not ever _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday even the white house stepped on its own message in conceding this point _meta_end_dot_

 t here s not a real good short term answer _meta_end_dot_

 and we ve been very explicit about that from the beginning perino told the press corps adding there s not going to be a short term response and it would be irresponsible for anybody to suggest there would be that sounds about right though as ali at tp noted it also runs counter to republican talking points which absolutely point to coastal drilling as a short term response _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope they were listening to perino s response _meta_end_dot_
