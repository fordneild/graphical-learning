  john nance garner a former house speaker who became one of fdr s vice presidents is widely credited with having said that the vp s office isn t worth a warm bucket of spit though reporters are rumored to have changed the spelling of the last word to make it appropriate for publication _meta_end_dot_

 of course that was nearly _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 since then al gore became one of the most powerful vps in history and then dick cheney radically expanded the power of the vice presidency to the extent that he effectively declared the office of the vp a fourth branch of government _meta_end_dot_

 now the job is sought after especially by senators _meta_end_dot_

 it s unusual but right now we have three sitting senators remaining as presidential candidates and as such for the first time ever we ll see two sitting senators facing each other in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 their _meta_number_ref_ colleagues are probably thinking hey if they re good enough for national office so am i and if you ask some of them they ll even say so _meta_end_dot_

 in all more than a fifth of the chamber would seriously consider an offer to join their respective party s presidential ticket _meta_end_dot_

 given some of the names who demurred it s safe to say the actual number of interested senators is considerably higher _meta_end_dot_

 the hill asked all _meta_number_ref_ senators not running for president the same question if you were asked would you accept an offer to be the vice presidential nominee nine said they would undoubtedly accept an offer _meta_number_ref_ said they would think about it _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds like the gig has come a long way since it was a warm bucket of spit the fact that webb answered the question with a grin by the way will not go unnoticed by the political establishment _meta_end_dot_

 there s been quite a bit of talk about webb s possible role on the ticket he s a young decorated veteran from a possible swing state with broad independent appeal and his answer will only stir additional speculation _meta_end_dot_
