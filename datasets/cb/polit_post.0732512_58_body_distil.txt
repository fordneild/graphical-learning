  yesterday s announced breakthrough on stem cell research is obviously good news for medicine public health and scientific advancements _meta_end_dot_

 scientists from the united states and japan have successfully been able to reprogram skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 if the promise of these results is true experts can move forward on embryonic stem cell research without embryos thus ending the political and philosophical debate _meta_end_dot_

 the bush white house which has stood in the laboratory door for seven years suddenly feels justified _meta_end_dot_

 indeed presidential aides were so proud of themselves yesterday they insisted that bush drove the breakthrough experiments by claiming some ambiguous moral standard _meta_end_dot_

 this is very much in accord with the president s vision from the get go said karl zinsmeister a bush domestic policy adviser _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there s any doubt that the president s drawing of lines on cloning and embryo use was a positive factor in making this come to fruition look we should all be really pleased by yesterday s news and the scientific advancements offer hope for life saving medical research _meta_end_dot_

 but for the white house to suggest that bush deserves some kind of credit for the progress is nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 the opposite is true _meta_end_dot_

 taking the political argument to the next step meanwhile shows that the single happiest people in the country yesterday were republican presidential candidates none of whom wanted to explain their opposition to life saving research that the overwhelming majority of americans support _meta_end_dot_

 now it looks like the issue has been taken off the table for the _meta_number_ref_ presidential race leading to a massive gop exhale _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting by the way that scientists sill want some short term research on actual embryonic stem cells because the research on the new method needs to be tested against the existing model _meta_end_dot_

 in this sense there may still be some fighting left to do _meta_end_dot_
