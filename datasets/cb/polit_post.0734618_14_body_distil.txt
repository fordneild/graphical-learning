  over the last couple of months conservatives rhetoric when it comes to torture by waterboarding has taken a turn for the worse _meta_end_dot_

 not too long ago the right argued that waterboarding is a necessary evil torture is wrong they d say but in extreme jack bauer like circumstances maybe the nation should tolerate waterboarding for the worst of the worst _meta_end_dot_

 that was the talking point in say the spring _meta_end_dot_

 more recently the right has tried out a new tack waterboarding isn t a necessary evil it s hardly a big deal at all _meta_end_dot_

 republican strategist rachel marsden recently said on cnn one man s torture is another man s cia sponsored swim lesson but marsden is just some right wing flack kit bond is the ranking republican on the senate intelligence committee _meta_end_dot_

 worse bond isn t alone _meta_end_dot_

 similar take last night _meta_end_dot_

 remember hunter isn t just some nutty talking head on tv he s currently the ranking member on the house armed services committee and a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is eerily reminiscent of deroy murdock a contributing editor to the national review who told readers last month waterboarding is something of which every american should be proud what is wrong with these people _meta_end_question_

 how exactly did we get to a point in which conservatives brag about their support for medieval torture techniques _meta_end_question_

 what happened to conservatives sheepishly arguing that torture was wrong but occasionally necessary in extreme circumstances _meta_end_question_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
