  i used to think years ago that there was a difference between right wing lawmakers and right wing activists _meta_end_dot_

 they shared common goals and worldviews but those who were actually elected to public office had to be by virtue of their professional duties a little responsible _meta_end_dot_

 when they spoke they were speaking for hundreds of thousands of constituents while the coulters and limbaughs of the world only had to worry about humiliating themselves _meta_end_dot_

 it was incumbent on even the most unhinged gop lawmakers i thought to use at least a modicum of dignity _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately i quickly realized how silly this assumption really was _meta_end_dot_

 some of these republican officials are just clownish as their most unhinged supporters _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in a few cases they re even worse _meta_end_dot_

 now i ve seen kingston interviewed on several occasions and one realizes that he s either frighteningly dumb or he s pretending to be frighteningly dumb _meta_end_dot_

 the difference may actually matter in a case like this if one assumes the moronic things he says is part of an elaborate act then one can safely assume he knows the truth but prefers to lie _meta_end_dot_

 if his imbecilic remarks are genuine then kingston is probably not a liar but rather someone just barely sharp enough to tie his shoes in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 noted the string of foolishness _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is obviously false _meta_end_dot_

 both michelle and barack obama have commented on the remarks frequently _meta_end_dot_

 again ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 i marvel at the kind of uninformed people who buy into bogus email smears but kingston is suggesting that republican members of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house are just susceptible to falling for a right wing con _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
