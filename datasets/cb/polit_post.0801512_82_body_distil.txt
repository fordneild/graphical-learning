  the intensity of the race based debate surrounding the two leading democratic presidential candidates seemed poised to get worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 the tone and volume of the dispute was not only driving a wedge in the party it seemed like the kind of clash that could do lasting damage _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately before matters got out of control barack obama and hillary clinton decided yesterday that it was time to take the high road _meta_end_dot_

 obama got this started yesterday afternoon with a press conference in nevada _meta_end_dot_

 obama added i may disagree with senator clinton and senator edwards on how to get there but we share the same goals _meta_end_dot_

 they are good people _meta_end_dot_

 they are patriots _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want the campaign at this stage to degenerate to so much tit for tat back and forth that we lose sight of why we are doing this _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got too much at stake at this time in our history to be engaging in this kind of silliness shortly thereafter clinton followed suit _meta_end_dot_

 here s the statement from the clinton campaign issued just a couple of hours after obama s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 good for both of them _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect the temptation to fan the flames and raise the temperature was great but this was without a doubt the right way to go _meta_end_dot_

 that said there is i m sad to say a nagging cynical side of me that wonders whether the detente will hold _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of late has largely been one of surrogates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton backers such as bob johnson bob kerrey mark penn billy shaheen andrew cuomo and assorted anonymous advisors have helped create this dispute with contentious remarks that were ostensibly not authorized by the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s my hope that yesterday s developments were a positive sign of things to come _meta_end_dot_

 but my fear isn t that obama and clinton will personally keep this skirmish alive it s that people speaking on their behalf will _meta_end_dot_
