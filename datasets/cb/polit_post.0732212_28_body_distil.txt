  there are all kinds of important news items about pakistan in the dailies this morning including revelations about a heretofore secret u s _meta_end_dot_

 program to secure the country s nuclear weapons a renewed interest in adding some oversight to the billions of dollars the bush administration gives pervez musharraf for counter terrorism efforts which may not actually exist and the fruitless efforts to convince musharraf to declare a date for the end of his de facto martial law _meta_end_dot_

 but the story that stood out for me was this gem about president bush once again misjudging a foreign leader s soul _meta_end_dot_

 you think _meta_end_question_

 it s worth noting from time to time that among this president s many glaring misjudgments is a stunningly weak capacity for judging characters _meta_end_dot_

 he looked into vladimir putin s eyes and admired his soul closer to home bush was equally quick to embrace men like donald rumsfeld alberto gonzales and dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of this ron suskind piece from _meta_number_ref_ after seven years of failures one would like to think that perhaps bush would start ignoring his gut it clearly hasn t served him well _meta_end_dot_

 funny it looks like putin would probably say the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 i m looking forward to a grown up president in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how about you _meta_end_question_
