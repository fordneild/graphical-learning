  back in december we learned the painful story of jamie leigh jones who says she was gang raped by halliburton kbr coworkers in baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 jones filed a lawsuit arguing that she had been raped by several attackers who first drugged her then repeatedly raped and injured her both physically and emotionally jones told abcnews com that an examination by army doctors showed she had been raped both vaginally and anally but that the rape kit disappeared after it was handed over to kbr security officers _meta_end_dot_

 this week it appears that jones is without legal recourse _meta_end_dot_

 jones couldn t seek criminal justice against her attackers and then she couldn t seek civil justice either _meta_end_dot_

 it s the result of tort reform garrity s op ed is worth reading in its entirety _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
