  time for a quick quiz _meta_end_dot_

 question _meta_number_ref_ when barack obama campaigned in altoona pa a few weeks ago what was his bowling score _meta_end_question_

 and question _meta_number_ref_ name one thing anything about joe biden s healthcare plan _meta_end_dot_

 elizabeth edwards makes the point today that thanks to media coverage we can all immediately answer the first and struggle to answer the second _meta_end_dot_

 edwards also cited a report from the project for excellence in journalism and the shorenstein center on the press politics and public policy which found that in the early months of this year when iowa new hampshire super tuesday states and others were voting _meta_percent_ref_ of campaign coverage highlighted political strategy and _meta_percent_ref_ focused on the candidates ideas and proposals _meta_end_dot_

 it s a multi faceted problem _meta_end_dot_

 al gore appeared on good morning america to talk about his book assault on reason the book which i loved is principally about raising the level of debate in the country and the ways in which the media is failing to even try to maintain an informed electorate _meta_end_dot_

 abc s diane sawyer s first question was you re not going to tell me again that you have no plans to run are you when gore tried to explain that his book had nothing to do the campaign sawyer re asked the question three more times lowering the level of the discourse while interviewing an author whose book was about raising the level of the discourse _meta_end_dot_

 she was basically using the book as a script _meta_end_dot_

 at one point she asked gore again not to come back to this and fall into your thesis that the press only wants the horserace of the political campaign but one way at which point gore interrupted but back to the horserace whenever the camera turned to gore the chyron read in all caps al gore on the attack will he run for the white house behind gore and sawyer a giant screen showed a graphic the race to _meta_number_ref_ and that was _meta_number_ref_ months ago _meta_end_dot_

 the media s efforts have not improved in the interim _meta_end_dot_

 in edwards nyt piece she added the problem today unfortunately is that voters who take their responsibility to be informed seriously enough to search out information about the candidates are finding it harder and harder to do so particularly if they do not have access to the internet i m not entirely sure if that s true _meta_end_dot_

 if people have internet access searching out detailed substantive information has never been easier _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t have access a local library offers it for free _meta_end_dot_

 the broader point though is that those who do want detailed substantive information have to circumvent the very news outlets that are supposed to keep them informed _meta_end_dot_

 those who take their responsibilities as a voter seriously have come to realize that watching cnn or any of the networks for a couple of hours a day won t actually keep them informed in any meaningful way though they re bound to hear about obama s bowling clinton s laugh edwards haircuts etc _meta_end_dot_

 edwards take on the future is discouraging _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds about right except i have one nagging concern if a news outlet decided to reshuffle its priorities and mention obama s bowling score in passing while emphasizing serious policy discussions i m not at all sure americans would watch _meta_end_dot_

 the media is a business _meta_end_dot_

 cnn msnbc and the like put on programming that will in turn boost ratings that will in turn make money _meta_end_dot_

 i can just imagine the promo tonight in a cnn special prime time report chris dodd s cap and trade proposal _meta_end_dot_

 who would it help _meta_end_question_

 how much would it cost _meta_end_question_

 we ask policy experts who ll set the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 tune in i have a hunch the local public access channel would have higher ratings _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the answer _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea but the media s reach is diminishing the electorate isn t any better informed and the political process is focusing less and less on issues that matter _meta_end_dot_
