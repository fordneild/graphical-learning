  what is it with republican leaders getting confused about basics in the middle east this week _meta_end_question_

 john mccain got confused on four separate occasions about sunni and shia iran and al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 and then yesterday bush flubbed one of his own on iran and nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 ah yes shorthanded the white house uses this euphemism once in a great while to explain that while what the president said is clearly false the inaccurate comments help summarize his broader point thus making his mistake less of a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 asked if iran could exploit bush s inaccurate remarks for political purposes johndroe said i m not concerned about that but like mccain s explanation for his confusion the white house s reasoning for bush s errors of fact and judgment doesn t exactly add up _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the president falsely argued that iran has declared they want a nuclear weapon to destroy people and that the islamic republic could be hiding a secret program _meta_end_dot_

 even bush aides acknowledge that this is unsupported by the facts but before they argue that he misspoke remember that he made the same bogus claim in august _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely then that the president like the republican who hopes to succeed him just believes things that aren t true _meta_end_dot_

 dan froomkin hammered this home quite nicely _meta_end_dot_

 it s a reminder that having a clueless president is not without consequences _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it s also a reminder of why mccain represents four more years of the status quo _meta_end_dot_
