  depending on one s tolerance and affinity for ron paul one question from last night s cnn youtube debate was either brilliant or offensive _meta_end_dot_

 a young man in arlington texas specifically asked the texas lawmaker to clear something up for him _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t come right out and say it but the questioner seemed to be saying you re not really crazy are you paul didn t disappoint _meta_end_dot_

 in other words no paul supporters aren t putting words in his mouth _meta_end_dot_

 second a more importantly there s no such thing as a proposed nafta superhighway _meta_end_dot_

 texas state lawmakers may have passed a bill opposing it but that just means texas state lawmakers took a firm stand against an internet rumor about a highway project that doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 and third i suppose paul deserves some credit for consistency _meta_end_dot_

 some candidates say nutty things to supporters but then put on a more presentable face for national television audiences _meta_end_dot_

 not paul he was asked if he sees a sinister force involving the cfr the trilateral commission and some notion of a north american union and he had the courage to say in effect yep that doesn t make him right of course but i can appreciate it when oddballs stick to their principles _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of paul one question came up that i ve been thinking about for a while now hmm no intention of running as an independent _meta_end_dot_

 i d take that as a maybe
