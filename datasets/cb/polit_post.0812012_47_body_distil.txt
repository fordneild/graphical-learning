  for the first couple of years of bush s first term there was an amusing phenomenon involving the president s photo ops they tended not to make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ bush visited a job training program in oregon highlighting it as the kind of success story that deserves support _meta_end_dot_

 he then cut the program s federal funding _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he visited a children s hospital in atlanta and vowed to help the hospital continue its work _meta_end_dot_

 bush then proceeded to cut the hospital s federal funding _meta_end_dot_

 lately i ve begun to think john mccain has hired the same advance team _meta_end_dot_

 about a week ago mccain traveled to gee s bend alabama and touted the success of a local ferry that crosses the alabama river _meta_end_dot_

 an rnc spokesperson said the ferry he will be riding is very important to that community _meta_end_dot_

 it s both a good and terrible symbol _meta_end_dot_

 it s good that it now exists but it s terrible it took so long to build it we soon learned however that the ferry was paid for by a congressional earmark and if mccain had his way the very important ferry wouldn t be there _meta_end_dot_

 a few days later the senator visited youngstown ohio and stood before a nearly shuttered factory pocked with broken windows to tout the benefits of free trade policies like nafta _meta_end_dot_

 mccain a multi millionaire told the factory s five remaining workers to hold on and wait for surprises that might come if we reject protectionism yesterday in miami mccain did it again kicking off a week of health care events at miami children s hospital _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out mccain doesn t understand that at all _meta_end_dot_

 the policy that helped the bernard family is one that mccain happens to oppose _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like the kind of location mccain should try to avoid not exploit for a photo op _meta_end_dot_

 this seems like an easy story for the media to pick up on if reporters were interested mccain keeps visiting specific locales for campaign purposes but in nearly every instance he either has or intends to undercut the facilities he s visiting _meta_end_dot_

 this should be quite an embarrassment for mccain and his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and yet i have a hunch this will go completely unmentioned _meta_end_dot_

 and just as an aside i ve been mulling over where mccain could go to talk to people who would benefit from his policy agenda _meta_end_dot_

 country clubs _meta_end_question_

 corporate board rooms _meta_end_question_

 military contractor conventions _meta_end_question_

 no wonder mccain is showing up in odd places he has limited options about where he can realistically go _meta_end_dot_
