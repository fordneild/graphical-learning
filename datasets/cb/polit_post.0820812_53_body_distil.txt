  i can appreciate the fact that republicans aren t quite sure how to criticize barack obama s international travel over the last week _meta_end_dot_

 it has after all been an usually successful trip which the mccain campaign practically goaded obama into taking _meta_end_dot_

 they ve tried out a few angles but the attacks have either been foolish contradictory or both _meta_end_dot_

 republicans said obama shouldn t campaign outside the u s but mccain did it first _meta_end_dot_

 they said obama shouldn t describe himself as a citizen of the world but reagan used the same line _meta_end_dot_

 they said obama shouldn t be so popular with people yearning to love america again but no one s sure what that actually means _meta_end_dot_

 so left with literally nothing else republicans have turned to an old stand by they re making stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 obama had planned to visit with injured u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in germany before he left the country this week _meta_end_dot_

 he scheduled a visit he wanted to visit and he arranged for the visit three weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 and suddenly the meeting was called off and obama left the country without having seen the troops _meta_end_dot_

 a ha said the unhinged right _meta_end_dot_

 obama was blowing off the troops this not surprisingly is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 nbc news andrea mitchell had a good report yesterday knocking this nonsense down _meta_end_dot_

 this was not in other words the fault of obama or his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the pentagon called the shots and the pentagon prevented the visit _meta_end_dot_

 far from snubbing the troops obama and his team were reportedly furious about the interference _meta_end_dot_

 gibbs in retrospect seemed to be taking the high ground he knew the pentagon had interfered but didn t want to blame the pentagon for the cancellation _meta_end_dot_

 but his statement was seized upon by the mccain campaign and the far right in general _meta_end_dot_

 the unhinged attacks notwithstanding the reality remains the same _meta_end_dot_

 gibbs set the record straight yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent added another bogus mccain campaign attack to add to the list _meta_end_dot_
