  i have to say i ve had quite enough economist bashing for one campaign cycle _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago defending her silly gas tax holiday proposal hillary clinton said it didn t matter than every professional economist in the country insisted the idea was ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to put my lot in with economists clinton said adding that economists are part of the elite opinion that is always on the side of doing things that really disadvantage the vast majority of americans clinton s remarks were easy to overlook since everyone knew she didn t mean a word of it but john mccain is picking up where she left off _meta_end_dot_

 at an event in new hampshire asked about his gas tax holiday proposal mccain lashed out angrily saying if you want to call it a gimmick fine _meta_end_dot_

 you know the economists _meta_end_question_

 they re the same ones that didn t predict this housing crisis we re in first i don t know what mccain has against economists _meta_end_dot_

 he s hired a whole team of them to try to rationalize his ridiculous economic policy _meta_end_dot_

 second it s not just economists who realize mccain s gas tax idea is absurd it s common sense _meta_end_dot_

 we have a fixed supply of gas so even a little critical thinking shows that the tax cut really goes to the oil companies and third blaming economists for failing to predict the housing crisis is especially inane since the opposite is true _meta_end_dot_

 explained brad lists a series of prominent experts with phds in economics joseph stiglitz paul krugman dean baker and duncan black atrios all of whom have been right about housing and energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t the economists it s mccain s reluctance to listen to anyone outside his bubble _meta_end_dot_

 well that and his own ignorance despite three decades as a washington insider _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but notice that mccain has not yet even tried to defend the merit of his gas tax holiday _meta_end_dot_

 not even once _meta_end_dot_

 he ll lash out angrily at critics and question the utility of economists but mccain can t bring himself to say i think the gas tax holiday would work and here s why what does that tell you about the merit of his ideas _meta_end_question_
