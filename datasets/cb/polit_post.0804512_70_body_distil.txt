  as far as barack obama s campaign is concerned superdelegates party insiders lawmakers and establishment players should not dictate the party s nominating process especially if it means overriding the will of voters who participated in the party s primaries and caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 as far as hillary clinton s campaign is concerned all bets are off _meta_end_dot_

 now i suspect the response from obama supporters will be less than kind _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton successfully fights for the nomination after coming in second among earned delegates the talk will no doubt be that she stole the race _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not exactly the situation here _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic national committee decades ago added superdelegates to the process with the express intention of creating a check against popular will _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton didn t create this system she s just competing in it _meta_end_dot_

 if she can claim the nomination through superdelegates instead of through actual primaries and caucuses it makes more sense to blame a flawed process than the candidate and her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is to borrow a phrase in it to win it _meta_end_dot_

 if that means playing hardball taking what the nyt described today as potentially incendiary steps and overriding voters who participated in primaries and caucuses she s within her rights to do so _meta_end_dot_

 it may wreak havoc within the party but it s a reminder that the party shouldn t have come up with this process in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 supposed to do _meta_end_dot_

 that said the clinton campaign hasn t quite nailed down its message _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s communications director howard wolfson told reporters yesterday we don t make distinctions between delegates chosen by million of voters in a primary and those chosen between tens of thousands in caucuses around the same time clinton s pollster and senior strategist mark penn was saying the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we re back to asterisks again some delegates and victories are better than others _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign also touched on a point that s very hard to resolve _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates should vote however they want but if they were inclined to go with the will of the voters the next question is which voters _meta_end_dot_

 if you re john kerry for example do you back clinton because she had more support from dems in massachusetts or do you back obama because he has more support from dems nationwide _meta_end_question_

 different superdelegates will reach different conclusions about this complicating matters further _meta_end_dot_

 one more thing the ap s ron fournier noted that clinton based on current counts leads obama among superdelegates but she shouldn t take that to the bank _meta_end_dot_

 something to consider _meta_end_dot_
