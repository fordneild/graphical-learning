  i ve marveled for years at the apparent corruption and incompetence in bush s department of housing and urban development but the washington post ran a disconcerting front page item yesterday explaining that mismanagement and criminal investigations arguably weren t the most offensive part of bush s hud _meta_end_dot_

 hmm why does this sound so familiar _meta_end_question_

 bush puts an unqualified buddy in charge of a major federal agency the bush buddy ignores the concerns of qualified aides and experts the buddy then sees a crisis emerge and chooses to intentionally not act and when pressed for an explanation the white house says bush s buddy is doing a heckuva job _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to be a running theme with these guys _meta_end_dot_

 the tragedy of it all is that jackson was directed to take on a specific task increase homeownership _meta_end_dot_

 for the white house it was an end unto itself if more people bought homes it would be good for the economy create more stable communities etc _meta_end_dot_

 when the president would try to tout the success of his economic policies he d routinely point to increases in home ownership as a key indicator _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course was how jackson and the bush administration went about achieving that goal by loosening regulations on borrowing and exacerbating the mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 but it was jackson s decision to honor himself that seals the deal _meta_end_dot_

 his portrait was considered an emergency he hired himself a cook at public expense and was one of the few cabinet secretaries to demand a full time security detail despite a low public profile _meta_end_dot_

 and all of this comes on top of the fact that bush s hud secretary has faced investigations from the justice department his own agency s inspector general the fbi and a federal grand jury _meta_end_dot_

 if the housing crisis weren t so serious this kind of ridiculousness might even be laughable _meta_end_dot_
