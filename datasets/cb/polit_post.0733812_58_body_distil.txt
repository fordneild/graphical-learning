  when hillary clinton s democratic skeptics list their biggest electoral concerns near the top is the belief that she would undermine democratic candidates chances down ballot _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pretty straightforward idea clinton is a polarizing dem who generates strong negative feelings in most red states _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton is at the top of the ballot and republicans are motivated to come to the polls to vote against her democratic congressional candidates who won t want to campaign alongside the new york senator will be at a distinct disadvantage _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all heard the argument but the evidence to support it is surprisingly thin _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt sets the stage today _meta_end_dot_

 as evidence the times highlights rep _meta_end_dot_

 nancy boyda a freshman dem from kansas who narrowly won an upset last year appealing to conservative democrats and moderate republicans _meta_end_dot_

 would a clinton nomination hurt boyda s chances _meta_end_question_

 the nyt quotes republicans to bolster the thesis _meta_end_dot_

 wait the evidence that clinton would be a drag on democratic candidates down ballot comes from the others side of the aisle _meta_end_question_

 according to the nyt yes _meta_end_dot_

 i m willing to be convinced that clinton might undermine dems down ballot chances but this won t cut it _meta_end_dot_

 the article quotes exactly zero dems expressing any on the record concerns at all and citing rhetoric from kansas republicans isn t exactly persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 as for boyda she told the nyt it is something i have no control over quite honestly _meta_end_dot_

 they will demonize any democrat who becomes the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i just put my head down and work she s quite right the gop will relentlessly smear any dem who gets the nomination it s what the right does better than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 for me that s not necessarily the end of the discussion the next question is whether those attempts to demonize would be more effective against some candidates than others but it s a reminder that this anti clinton talking point still needs quite a bit of work _meta_end_dot_

 the polls don t support the argument the endorsements from congressional dems don t support the argument and quotes from republicans in kansas don t support the argument _meta_end_dot_

 if there s proof i m all ears but this nyt article is pretty weak _meta_end_dot_
