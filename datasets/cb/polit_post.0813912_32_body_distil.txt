  there are pockets of angry clinton campaign supporters who at least for now claim they if they can t have their candidate at the top of the ticket they no longer care if the democratic party wins back the white house _meta_end_dot_

 for these isolated few the goal isn t to advance a progressive agenda or to make progress on the issues important to hillary clinton but rather to elevate an individual _meta_end_dot_

 if the consequences are awful for the country in general and clinton s priorities in specific so be it _meta_end_dot_

 political observers tend to hear this kind of talk in every nominating fight _meta_end_dot_

 there were hard core howard dean fans four years ago who said it was him or nothing _meta_end_dot_

 there were hard core john mccain opponents in the gop who said earlier this year they d rather have a democrat win _meta_end_dot_

 in time however animosity fades and people who take politics seriously begin to put issues and priorities ahead of personalities _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of the clinton obama contest that s fairly easy since the two tend to agree on most policies _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that the reconciliation tends to take time and as the democratic process has dragged out the window of opportunity to bring the party back together again as grown smaller _meta_end_dot_

 it s why it s encouraging to see some party insiders begin the inevitable merger now _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s exactly the right attitude to have _meta_end_dot_

 obviously these are incremental steps _meta_end_dot_

 some clinton backers are annoyed that obama has called them the politics of the past _meta_end_dot_

 some obama supporters are annoyed that clinton is dragging this out against insurmountable odds _meta_end_dot_

 clinton people believe she s been the victim of gender based criticism _meta_end_dot_

 obama people believe he s been the victim of race based criticism _meta_end_dot_

 clinton people want help retiring a massive _meta_dollor_ref_ million debt _meta_end_dot_

 obama people believe that really isn t their problem _meta_end_dot_

 all the more reason then to start bringing everybody together now cooperating towards a common goal _meta_end_dot_

 i m cautiously optimistic about healing the rifts and having a united party in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 cautiously _meta_end_dot_
