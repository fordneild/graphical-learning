  in my heart of hearts i don t really believe there are any americans who would base their presidential vote on flag pins and the star spangled banner _meta_end_dot_

 people can and do back or oppose candidates for some pretty superficial reasons but no one s that dumb _meta_end_dot_

 my hunch is that voters when it comes to barack obama may decide they don t like him for other reasons and then rationalize backwards coming up with pins and patriotism to justify a more personal animosity _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless thanks to email chains and the national media obama keeps hearing about this _meta_end_dot_

 at a town hall meeting in indiana a woman told obama that her mother wasn t going to vote for him because he didn t address the flag obama responded this is a phony issue so let me address it right now on the pledge on the picture in iowa during the national anthem on the flag pin and on his critics it pains me to think this has actually become part of the political discourse _meta_end_dot_

 it points to a system and a process that is so spectacularly detached from reality that it s amazing anyone would ever want to run for public office in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 we ve reached a point at which the display of symbols is as important if not more so than that the freedoms the symbols represent _meta_end_question_

 maybe or maybe some people are looking for an excuse to oppose obama s candidacy and this nonsense is a cheap and easy way out _meta_end_dot_

 i d just like to ask these folks who purport to care whether they mind if hillary clinton s or john mccain s lapels are flagless _meta_end_dot_

 whether they minded that ronald reagan jfk eisenhower and fdr didn t wear pins _meta_end_dot_

 whether they think george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was unpatriotic before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when his lapels were bare _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt obama would do this but i can imagine a town hall meeting in which this comes up and the senator asks everyone in the room wearing a flag lapel pin probably made in china to raise their hand _meta_end_dot_

 when a small fraction of the crowd does obama can ask them do those of you who didn t raise your hand love the country as much as those who did
