  forty years ago today in memphis tenn dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 was assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain will speak in memphis today as part of his biography tour and will reflect on the slain civil rights leader s legacy _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for mccain though the speech and the anniversary offer the political world a fresh opportunity to reconsider the senator s own history when it comes to king and civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 for the republican presidential candidate that s not good news mccain would no doubt prefer that voters ignore some of his previous positions _meta_end_dot_

 the vote wasn t the only problem _meta_end_dot_

 in his home state of arizona conservatives in the state legislature blocked a measure to create a holiday honoring king prompting then gov _meta_end_dot_

 bruce babbitt d to declare one through executive order _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ republican gov _meta_end_dot_

 evan mecham s first act in office was to rescind babbitt s order on the king holiday _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain endorsed mecham s decision _meta_end_dot_

 complicating matters mccain no doubt embarrassed by his previous positions is being less than truthful about them now _meta_end_dot_

 pressed on his record by reporters _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain began to learn and studied after his opposition to the king holiday in _meta_number_ref_ he was a very slow learner _meta_end_dot_

 four years later he didn t fight against a governor or his own party he endorsed the governor s move to eliminate a king holiday _meta_end_dot_

 six years after his house vote he began supporting a state holiday but still opposed a federal king holiday _meta_end_dot_

 eleven years after his vote he tried to strip federal funding from the mlk federal holiday commission _meta_end_dot_

 seventeen years after his vote mccain publicly endorsed south carolina s right to fly the confederate flag over its statehouse _meta_end_dot_

 now in the interest of fairness it s worth noting that mccain ended up years after the fact in the right place and reversed himself on practically all of his previous positions _meta_end_dot_

 better late than never i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 but for a presidential candidate running almost exclusively on his background and personal history this is one part of mccain s past that he would just as soon we forget _meta_end_dot_

 we won t _meta_end_dot_
