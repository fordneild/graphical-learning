  guest post by dna for the past week john mccain has been attempting to hit barack obama for reneging on his pledge to pursue public financing should he win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 aside from the fact that no pledge was ever made mccain s own abuse of the public financing system negates any presumption of good faith on his part _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t just eager to use public financing as a way of neutralizing obama s potential fundraising advantage in a general election match up he was eager to use it to bail out his flagging campaign _meta_end_dot_

 via paul kiel at tpm muckraker hardly the kind of behavior you d expect from a self avowed champion of the taxpayer s dollars _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s own financial irresponsibility led his campaign to bankruptcy and in his moment of need he expected a government bailout _meta_end_dot_

 as usual republicans think of welfare as big government except when they re broke and need money _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s arrogance and selective memory were on display last night at a campaign even in wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 as usual the republicans allergy to big government begins and ends with economic regulation while acquiescing entirely to invasions of privacy and violations of due process _meta_end_dot_

 mccain likes to brag about his record on earmarks and yet he saw no hypocrisy in expecting taxpayers to foot the bill for his campaign to the tune of five million dollars should he fail to become the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps the most telling part of the anecdote is mccain s proclamation with a democrat in power we would see more useless spending in the mold of alaska s _meta_dollor_ref_ million bridge to nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 that earmark was proposed by senator ted stevens a republican _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats should hit mccain on the inconsistencies between his reputation for alleged fiscal discipline and his abuse of the public financing system as hard as they can _meta_end_dot_
