  as expected the moments the polls closed in kentucky the networks called the state for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the votes are still being tallied but it s not close _meta_end_dot_

 that said it probably won t be a landslide on par with west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 with about _meta_percent_ref_ of the precincts reporting clinton s lead over obama is about _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the margin may yet increase but i kind of thought obama would lose by a lot more _meta_end_dot_

 as for the exit polls they weren t encouraging for the party _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be back in a bit with more _meta_end_dot_

 update this is far more in line with expectations with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote reporting the margin of clinton s lead is up to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
