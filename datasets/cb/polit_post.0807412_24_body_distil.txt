  before we get too caught up in choosing the next president it s probably worth keeping in mind that the current president continues to make startlingly bad decisions that affect us all _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps but bush does stuff like this anyway _meta_end_dot_

 with the epa overriding the unanimous judgment of its scientific advisory council which pushed for a more protective standard it s worth taking a moment to consider just how damaging the bush gang has been for the epa _meta_end_dot_

 the president and his team have decimated any number of federal agencies many of which used to be effective and efficient thanks to neglect and the promotion of political hacks but the epa s demise has been especially striking _meta_end_dot_

 kate sheppard noted some of the controversies from just the past week _meta_end_dot_

 the epa s big update of smog standards yesterday was significantly less stringent than the standards recommended unanimously by its own scientific advisory council at the behest of bush himself _meta_end_dot_

 also yesterday house oversight and government reform chairman henry waxman issued a letter to administrator stephen johnson expressing concern that multiple senior epa officials have disclosed that the epa has ceased their efforts to abide by the supreme court ruling in massachusetts v _meta_end_dot_

 epa that they should be regulating tailpipe greenhouse emissions _meta_end_dot_

 johnson was also called to appear before the select committee on energy independence and global warming on thursday to discuss how the epa and the bush administration have responded to the case _meta_end_dot_

 today the house committee on science and technology s subcommittee on investigations _meta_number_ref_ oversight held a hearing examining the closure of epa regional and research libraries around the country and the gao released a report on the degree to which those closures have restricted staff and public access to records and information _meta_end_dot_

 and earlier in the week the story broke that unions at the agency pulled out of their partnership with management with union leaders registering complaints that johnson and other top managers have ignored their advice and violated the agency s scientific integrity _meta_end_dot_

 i shudder to think how long it will take for the next president to clean up some of bush s messes and how much worse things can get if mccain gives us a third term of bush like governing _meta_end_dot_
