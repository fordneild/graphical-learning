  the wsj s peggy noonan argues today that her top characteristic when evaluating presidential candidates is reasonableness the former reagan speechwriter insists at face value there s nothing especially troubling about this standard _meta_end_dot_

 noonan is setting the bar fairly low not insane isn t exactly a compelling campaign pitch but she s sketched out a relatively practical model _meta_end_dot_

 that is until noonan starts applying her standards to specific candidates _meta_end_dot_

 here s her take on the former senator from north carolina noonan had just finished arguing that american voters are grown ups and then she turns around and takes on john edwards hair suggesting brushing one s hair before a tv interview is somehow a disqualifying factor for a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he s just not reasonable enough _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 what s more glenn greenwald notes that poofing isn t actually a word but rather a british epithet for a male homosexual slang disparaging and offensive a synonym for faggot noonan s looking for a candidate with a prudent understanding of the world i m looking for a columnist with the same attribute _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 duncan hunter qualifies as a reasonable presidential candidate but clinton doesn t _meta_end_question_

 for entirely vacuous reasons _meta_end_question_

 for the record the noonan meter breaks down as follows reasonable biden dodd obama richardson romney mccain hunter thompson unreasonable clinton edwards huckabee reasonable but not desirable giuliani unmentioned kucinich gravel paul i have no idea what on earth noonan is talking about _meta_end_dot_
