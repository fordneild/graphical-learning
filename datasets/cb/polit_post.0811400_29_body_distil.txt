  msnbc abc cbs and fox news are all reporting that hillary clinton will win the pennsylvania s democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 the margin of victory however will likely make all the difference _meta_end_dot_

 a narrow win for clinton may end up looking like a moral victory for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 indeed there are some reports this evening that the obama campaign s strategy of late was to force clinton to spend heavily for a single digit victory which would leave her with limited resources for the remaining contests _meta_end_dot_

 obviously a larger victory will do the opposite increasing fundraising pressuring superdelegates etc _meta_end_dot_

 clinton told reporters earlier a win is a win if she ends up winning by a small margin expect to hear that phrase a lot tomorrow morning _meta_end_dot_
