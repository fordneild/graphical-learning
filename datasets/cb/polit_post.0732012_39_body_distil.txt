  a couple of weeks ago after a democratic debate in philadelphia the media hype was unmistakable hillary clinton had stumbled she was off her game she waffled got tripped up and lost her momentum by any reasonable measure all of this was wildly overstated it might have been clinton s least impressive debate performance but she wasn t that bad _meta_end_dot_

 news outlets just needed something to talk about and the clinton s post debate trouble narrative was easy _meta_end_dot_

 similarly those same outlets are reporting on last night s debate from nevada with a new narrative clinton is back actually she never really went away but apparently that s not important right now _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure clinton had a much better night than in philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago she was on the defensive last night she was on the offensive _meta_end_dot_

 when barack obama and john edwards would challenge her she d return fire _meta_end_dot_

 in just the first few minutes for example obama said w hat the american people are looking for right now is straight answers to tough questions _meta_end_dot_

 and that is not what we ve seen out of senator clinton on a host of issues instead of defending herself clinton struck back well i hear what senator obama is saying and he talks a lot about stepping up and taking responsibility and taking strong positions _meta_end_dot_

 but when it came time to step up and decide whether or not he would support universal health care coverage he chose not to do that _meta_end_dot_

 his plan would leave _meta_number_ref_ million americans out obama of course insisted that wasn t true but the result was a substantive back and forth on healthcare policy _meta_end_dot_

 it was as if cnn organized a debate and by accident a debate broke out _meta_end_dot_

 soon after edwards took a few shots and clinton again returned fire you know senator edwards raised health care again _meta_end_dot_

 when senator edwards ran in _meta_number_ref_ he wasn t for universal health care _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad he is now _meta_end_dot_

 but for him to be throwing this mud and making these charges i think really detracts from what we re trying to do here tonight what makes this interesting i suppose is that it was different _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was no longer trying to stay above the fray she was mixing it up _meta_end_dot_

 the media apparently was impressed _meta_end_dot_

 but there was a limit on the audience s tolerance for intra party criticism _meta_end_dot_

 last night we heard something unusual booing _meta_end_dot_

 this for example was a striking moment much later in the debate obama and clinton were clashing on social security and payroll taxes _meta_end_dot_

 clinton suggested a change would lead to a _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion tax increase obama wouldn t stand for it _meta_end_dot_

 for all the talk that democrats expect the leading candidates to go after one another this audience seemed to be saying the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps more so than in any other debate the crowd seemed decidedly pro clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in response to a question about playing the so called gender card clinton said well i m not exploiting anything at all _meta_end_dot_

 i m not playing as some people say the gender card here in los vegas _meta_end_dot_

 i m just trying to play the winning card and i understand well that people are not attacking me because i m a woman _meta_end_dot_

 they re attacking me because i m ahead it was pretty routine rhetoric but the crowd erupted _meta_end_dot_

 i m still not sure why _meta_end_dot_

 other observations from my notes obama has really grown as a candidate in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 in the early debates he d respond to every question with generalities painting every issue with a broad brush _meta_end_dot_

 there were a lot of ums and uhs as he collected his thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 he d start almost every sentence with look not anymore _meta_end_dot_

 last night i thought he missed a couple of opportunities but he demonstrated a lot of policy expertise _meta_end_dot_

 gone are the generalities obama backed his opinions up with details _meta_end_dot_

 you know who had a good night _meta_end_question_

 dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 in the other debates i could practically recite his soundbites along with him as he robotically repeated them for the _meta_number_ref_th time _meta_end_dot_

 last night he actually sounded like a human being _meta_end_dot_

 when wolf blitzer noted that he was the only person on the stage to vote against the patriot act he didn t hesitate that s because i read it he even mixed it up effectively with edwards on china policy _meta_end_dot_

 it was the first time this year when i was marginally glad kucinich was on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson said at one point that human rights are at times more important than american national security _meta_end_dot_

 that probably wasn t a smart thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd followed up with the right answer well obviously national security keeping the country safe _meta_end_dot_

 when you take the oath of office on january _meta_number_ref_th you promise to do two things and that is to protect and defend the constitution of the united states and protect our country against enemies both foreign and domestic _meta_end_dot_

 the security of the country is number one obviously yes all right if most of the attacks were geared towards clinton in philly most of the attacks were geared towards edwards last night _meta_end_dot_

 he can reasonably make the case that this was a positive development he s important enough to go after _meta_end_dot_

 the last question of the night was whether clinton preferred diamonds or pearls _meta_end_dot_

 i like the occasional off beat query but c mon _meta_end_dot_

 dumb dumb dumb _meta_end_dot_

 watching the dems debate is a reminder of just much more impressive these guys are than the republican presidential field _meta_end_dot_

 these seven knew policy cared about details and engaged in substantive back and forth discussions without mindless soundbites _meta_end_dot_

 if dems are the new england patriots the republicans are a pop warner team _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately last night was largely forgettable _meta_end_dot_

 there were no huge mistakes no knock out punches _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to imagine the debate changed anyone s mind about who to support _meta_end_dot_

 that said cnn was truly abysmally bad _meta_end_dot_

 i ll tackle that one in the next post _meta_end_dot_

 so what d you think _meta_end_question_
