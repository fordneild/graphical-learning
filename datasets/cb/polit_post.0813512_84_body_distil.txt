  following up on the last item by any realistic measure hillary clinton s landslide victory in west virginia while impressive has not changed any of the metrics of the democratic race _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama currently leads in pledged delegates superdelegates popular votes states won fundraising and poll numbers _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won big in a state where she was expected to win big but when it comes to the enormous deficit she s facing last night s gains barely dented obama s lead _meta_end_dot_

 hoping to build up excitement about her victory speech in west virginia campaign chairman terry mcauliffe told msnbc last night that we would hear one of the greatest speeches ever given campaign hyperbole notwithstanding clinton s pitch in charleston suggested she s going to do everything possible to drag this process out as long as she can _meta_end_dot_
