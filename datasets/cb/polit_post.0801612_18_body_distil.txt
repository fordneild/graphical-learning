  the democratic presidential primaries have in recent weeks taken an ugly often acrimonious turn _meta_end_dot_

 there have been some unusually bitter disputes about race gender unions history abortion and the media and one couldn t help but wonder if perhaps the campaign would get too nasty for the candidates own good _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i imagine a fair amount of the audience for last night s debate in las vegas tuned in if for no other reason to see if the three leading candidates a state court allowed msnbc to bar kucinich yesterday afternoon brought brass knuckles and baseball bats to the event _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it was largely the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 i don t always agree with kit seelye s debate coverage but i think she got this point quite right _meta_end_dot_

 at one point early on hillary said we re all family in the democratic party it set the tone for the rest of the night i think there was probably more laughter and light hearted moments than in most of the other debates combined _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t be at all surprised if the candidates pollsters noticed that rank and file dems didn t care at all for the spiteful turn in the campaign of late and wanted to see clinton edwards and obama drop the nonsense and get back to their messages _meta_end_dot_

 last night that s exactly what they did _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say however that the debate was boring _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary i thought the event once we got past the _meta_number_ref_ full minutes of horserace and process questions actually highlighted some interesting areas _meta_end_dot_

 observations from my notes clinton got a little tripped up on the robert johnson flap _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand she said we should take johnson at his word _meta_end_dot_

 on the other she said johnson s comments were out of bounds i m pretty sure those two positions contradict each other _meta_end_dot_

 clinton also refused to respond either way to a question about whether obama and edwards are qualified to serve as president _meta_end_dot_

 a simple of course would have sufficed _meta_end_dot_

 edwards responding to a question about his greatest weakness noted his emotional responses to pain that i see around me um john _meta_end_question_

 i know it s a stupid question but caring too much isn t really a weakness _meta_end_dot_

 there was a fascinating exchange between obama and clinton when it came to obama s greatest weakness he was refreshingly candid in his response talking about his inability to micro manage a bureucracy _meta_end_dot_

 clinton used this to hint that obama was like bush _meta_end_dot_

 obama turned it around the point in terms of bringing together a team is that you get the best people and you re able to execute and hold them accountable _meta_end_dot_

 there s something if we re going to evaluate george bush and his failures as president that i think are much more important _meta_end_dot_

 he was very efficient _meta_end_dot_

 he was on time all the time and you know had laughter you know i i m sure he never lost a paper _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he knows where it is _meta_end_dot_

 laughter what he could not do is to listen to perspectives that didn t agree with his ideological predispositions _meta_end_dot_

 what he could not do is to bring in different people with different perspectives and get them to work together when clinton started talking about sovereign wealth funds it was a reminder that when it comes to policy details she s second to no one in either party s presidential fields _meta_end_dot_

 edwards was confronted with a question about his vote for a _meta_number_ref_ bankruptcy bill which he now regrets it pointed to a problem that came up a few times last night edwards senate career _meta_end_dot_

 he voted for the war for a bad bankruptcy bill and for yucca mountain twice _meta_end_dot_

 it might have led the average viewer to wonder which edwards is the real one the moderate senator or the liberal candidate _meta_end_dot_

 clinton got a little tripped up on her own vote on the _meta_number_ref_ bankruptcy bill saying she voted for it but was happy that it never became law if she didn t want it become law why d she vote for it _meta_end_question_

 obama touted public financing of campaigns which was good to hear _meta_end_dot_

 he also took on the ridiculous email smear and the likeable enough flap both of which he handled very well _meta_end_dot_

 edwards best answer of the night came in support of benefits for the troops they didn t leave us on our own we shouldn t leave them on their own _meta_end_dot_

 and we need to narrow this gap between civilian pay and military pay and help these families with their child care on the same point obama reminded us that his limited senate career has produced a few substantive victories i went to walter reed to talk to the wounded warriors who had come back to discover that they were still paying for their meals and their phone calls while in walter reed while rehabbing which i could not believe _meta_end_dot_

 and i was able to gain the cooperation of a republican controlled senate at the time and pass a bill that would eliminate that none of them want to push gun control and all of them support allowing military recruiters on college campuses _meta_end_dot_

 no big surprises there _meta_end_dot_

 for all the pleasantries obama did criticize clinton on one thing politics of fear _meta_end_dot_

 clinton once again suggested that al qaeda may test the next president obama said i have to say that when senator clinton uses the specter of a terrorist attack with a new prime minister during a campaign i think that is part and parcel with what we ve seen the use of the fear of terrorism in scoring political points _meta_end_dot_

 and i think that s a mistake overall i got the sense that all three believe they re in pretty good shape both in nevada and elsewhere and knew that getting too aggressive would be a huge risk _meta_end_dot_

 instead they played it safe and kept it clean _meta_end_dot_

 and once again i feel compelled to mention something that i always seem to mention after democratic debates these three are really really good candidates _meta_end_dot_

 comparing them to the clowns running for the republican nomination is breathtaking given their command of the issues the seriousness of their agendas the depth of their visions and the ability to speak outside of scripted talking points _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard not to watch obama edwards and clinton and not be proud of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 so what d you think _meta_end_question_
