  it s tempting to think that john mccain is finally where he wants to be in the race for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 after all he now has impressive wins in new hampshire and south carolina under his belt _meta_end_dot_

 he fared poorly in nevada but the gop field didn t take the contest seriously and mccain never tried to compete there _meta_end_dot_

 there is of course a flip side to mccain s good news _meta_end_dot_

 his win over mike huckabee in south carolina was important but instead of dispelling concerns about mccain s long term chances the results actually reinforced them _meta_end_dot_

 it s a trend that may hurt mccain very soon florida s primary in nine days away and it doesn t allow independents to vote and several delegate rich feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states arizona california connecticut delaware and new york also limit the republican primaries to republican voters _meta_end_dot_

 so looking ahead who s winning _meta_end_question_

 dropped out last night and fred thompson who was betting his campaign on south carolina appears to be moving in the same direction _meta_end_dot_

 a senior campaign adviser to thompson conceded we are not blind to the obvious that winnows the field from seven to five _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee needed south carolina badly to generate some sense of momentum and give his lagging fundraising a boost but he came up short and may not have any more chances _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani has quickly become the contest s biggest joke _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul still appears to have no realistic chance of winning a single contest _meta_end_dot_

 and that leaves us with two candidates john mccain and mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 the latter the romney campaign is quick to remind us won more delegates yesterday than the prior _meta_end_dot_

 for the year it s not even close romney has nearly twice as many delegates as mccain so far for much of the week i assumed that a mccain victory in south carolina would be awful news for romney who wanted a huckabee or thompson victory to keep the contest muddled _meta_end_dot_

 but reassessing the contest now i see a definite up side for romney it looks like a two man race _meta_end_dot_

 romney can tell everyone in the republican base and establishment who loathes mccain and that s a big group that he s the only thing standing between them a mccain nomination _meta_end_dot_

 in a wooly contest with an ambiguous top tier limbaugh delay the religious right and far right blogs all expressed their contempt for mccain but they divided their loyalties in a wide open field _meta_end_dot_

 now they have a choice and an opportunity to do something about it _meta_end_dot_

 the media will quickly declare mccain yesterday s big winner and re label him the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it s already started _meta_end_dot_

 howard fineman argued last night that there is no longer any strong candidate in the race to oppose mccain _meta_end_dot_

 given that romney still has the big delegate lead mccain still isn t connecting with republicans there are very few open primaries left and the anti mccain factions in the party are now poised to coalesce around the guy who s actually in the lead this analysis seems rather flawed _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
