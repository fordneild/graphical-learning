  update there have been additional developments on this story _meta_end_dot_

 in the coming issue of joint force quarterly an official military journal widely distributed among officers the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff writes a welcome but unusual open letter to everyone who wears an armed forces uniform stay out of the political arena during the election season _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military must remain apolitical at all times and in all ways wrote the chairman adm _meta_end_dot_

 mike mullen the nation s highest ranking officer _meta_end_dot_

 it is and must always be a neutral instrument of the state no matter which party holds sway it s good advice and a good policy _meta_end_dot_

 mullen realizes that there will attempts to politicize the military and with the wars in iraq and afghanistan playing a huge role in the election season debate there will be opportunities for politicians to try to exploit those in uniform for partisan and or electoral gain _meta_end_dot_

 mullen wisely counsels the military to steer clear of the political morass _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably john mccain s campaign didn t get the message _meta_end_dot_

 first the notion that barack obama would embrace ahmadinejad and snub petraeus is so comically stupid it s striking that the mccain campaign would put the argument in print _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain s complete abandonment of propriety and military protocol is striking _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus is shown in uniform in a campaign fundraising letter without his permission _meta_end_dot_

 as jake tapper asks do you think it s at all contrary to mullen s message to use the photo of mccain and petraeus in a fundraising solicitation i m going to assume that s a rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_

 the decent thing for mccain to do is apologize _meta_end_dot_

 except as the fundraising letter itself helps prove decency has been in short supply lately at mccain campaign headquarters _meta_end_dot_
