  when it comes to campaign contributions the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign keeps turning the conventional wisdom on its ear _meta_end_dot_

 the political establishment assumes that two reliable allies of conservative republican candidates are u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and american clergy _meta_end_dot_

 on the prior we learned earlier in the fall that military donations are going heavily towards barack obama and ron paul both of whom are staunch opponents of the president s policy in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and on the latter clergy seem to be defying the conventional wisdom as well _meta_end_dot_

 in three of the last four cycles clergy have backed republicans in greater numbers than democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the lone exception _meta_number_ref_ was practically even _meta_end_dot_

 but this year clergy contributions are going to the dems by a wide margin according to the data from the center for responsive politics _meta_percent_ref_ is the strongest percentage dems have had with clergy donations in two decades _meta_end_dot_

 isn t even close _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obviously as the figures show clergy aren t going to compete with oil company executives any time soon when it comes to bundling and or hosting lucrative fundraisers _meta_end_dot_

 but who would have thought that a democratic candidate would have raised almost triple the leading republican when it comes to money from pastors _meta_end_question_

 the conventional wisdom is that the faithful overwhelmingly prefer republicans to dems _meta_end_dot_

 and yet there s ample evidence to the contrary _meta_end_dot_
