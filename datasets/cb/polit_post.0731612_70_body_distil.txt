  barack obama made his first appearance on meet the press in quite a while yesterday and subjected himself to tim russert s aggressive questioning _meta_end_dot_

 most political observers probably tune into interviews like these watching to see if the pugilist will knock his opponent down in this case if russert will nail obama with a subject that throws the candidate off his game catches him in a contradiction forces him into a gaffe etc _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out the hour long interview was relatively tepid and didn t produce any startling revelations _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly matt yglesias makes a very compelling argument that the whole purpose of russert interviews is dubious _meta_end_dot_

 but russert won t ask those questions unless he thinks there s a possible gotcha lurking underneath _meta_end_dot_

 it may seem silly but this leads to an awkward question what is the point of a show like meet the press _meta_end_question_

 ostensibly it s to provide useful information to the public so they can in turn make informed decisions _meta_end_dot_

 but that s an idealistic fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 americans don t actually learn anything from these interviews _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if these shows exist to impress other journalists and washington insiders which of course they do _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the russert primary has entered the political lexicon as a way to describe the phenomenon of candidates enduring a predictable routine whereby they re reminded of random comments they made years ago or are presented with provocative quotes given by allies whose names are not revealed until after they ve spoken _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as kevin drum added russert s schtick perpetuates the idea that the worst possible sin in a politician is displaying even a hint of inconsistency _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what _meta_end_question_

 it turns out there are worse things there has got to be a better way of covering politics _meta_end_dot_
