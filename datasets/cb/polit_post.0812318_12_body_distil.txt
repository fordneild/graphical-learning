  a couple of weeks ago the politico s jonathan martin reported that a key aspect of john mccain s general election strategy is to drive a triangulated contrast among himself the democratic nominee and president bush reuters reports today that we re starting to get a sense of what this strategy looks like in practice _meta_end_dot_

 the motivation is pretty obvious bush is after all the most unpopular president in modern american history and the republican party is clearly sensitive about the bush mccain connection as evidenced by karl rove and fox news pushing back against it _meta_end_dot_

 but in the end it s going to take more than half hearted criticism of katrina and mission accomplished if this strategy is going to have an effect _meta_end_dot_

 for the mccain gang this is about style not substance _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the pitch is relatively straightforward vote for john mccain he s george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush without the bubble but i get the sense this is a fundamental misread of public opinion _meta_end_dot_

 bush isn t the most unpopular president since the dawn of modern polling because americans are mad over invitation only rallies and misguided war banners _meta_end_dot_

 they re desperate for change because bush s policy agenda has been an abject failure _meta_end_dot_

 and here s the kicker mccain is running on bush s policy agenda anyway _meta_end_dot_

 on iraq the economy homeland security taxes the federal judiciary veterans benefits and as we saw this week healthcare mccain is bush only older and with slightly better grammar _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was recently asked to name the issues where he s different from bush _meta_end_dot_

 after hemming and hawing a bit mccain could point to exactly one issue w hat s an area of disagreement _meta_end_question_

 climate change _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that climate change is real _meta_end_dot_

 i think we have to act shortly thereafter wouldn t you know it bush said he believes climate change is real and we have to act removing the one subject on which bush and mccain allegedly disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 reuters reported that mccain is putting some distance between himself and bush _meta_end_dot_

 in every way that counts that s just not the case _meta_end_dot_
