  for quite a while the debate over blogs in the defense department was over whether u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops should be allowed to have them at all _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand some officials were concerned about security breaches with troops inadvertently sharing compromising information online _meta_end_dot_

 on the other some saw blogs as a morale boosting outlet for the troops _meta_end_dot_

 but as noah shachtman explained in an interesting report yesterday a study was written for u s _meta_end_dot_

 special operations command that took an entirely different approach to online communication which included the suggestion of possibly clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers the kinniburgh denning report was quite provocative suggesting paying prominent bloggers to address entrenched inequalities presumably in the media _meta_end_dot_

 the study did however note the downsides of such a plan people do not like to be deceived and the price of being exposed is lost credibility and trust now it s worth emphasizing that there s no apparent evidence that the pentagon actually put any prominent bloggers on the payroll _meta_end_dot_

 a spokesperson for u s _meta_end_dot_

 special operations command told shachtman that the kinniburgh denning report was merely an academic exercise the comments are not actionable merely thought provoking as far as i know prominent bloggers who toe the administration s line on iraq policy are doing so for ideological reasons not financial ones _meta_end_dot_

 but having said all of that is it really that surprising officials would consider a proposal to put bloggers on the pentagon s payroll _meta_end_question_

 didn t consider a proposal to put bloggers on the pentagon s payroll _meta_end_dot_

 after all the administration s track record is quite breathtaking _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen propagandistic efforts over and over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 the pentagon considered a plan to pay bloggers to get the administration s message out _meta_end_question_

 of course it did _meta_end_dot_
