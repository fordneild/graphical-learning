  there s been talk for years that many bush supporters believe he was literally chosen by god to be president _meta_end_dot_

 we don t hear as much about this lately god wanted a u s _meta_end_dot_

 president who would screw up everything he touches _meta_end_question_

 but the notion of divine intervention on behalf of republicans has been a relatively common sentiment in far right circles for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 that said direct comparisons between republican candidates and jesus are still rather unusual _meta_end_dot_

 via mcjoan right of course _meta_end_dot_

 she s not trying to compare mccain to jesus she s just says he s kind of like jesus the distinction is obvious _meta_end_dot_

 and sacrilegious _meta_end_dot_

 atrios added i m not christian so it doesn t really matter much to me who is casually compared to their lord and savior but still victory dinner thanks to reader j c _meta_end_dot_

 for the tip this was just a reminder the republicans victory dinner _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder these guys are looking for a savior _meta_end_dot_

 literally _meta_end_dot_
