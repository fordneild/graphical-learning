  according to the latest gallup poll hillary clinton has a veracity problem _meta_end_dot_

 more specifically when respondents were asked about the candidates honesty and trustworthiness mccain did very well _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in his favor obama did nearly as well _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in his favor while clinton fared poorly _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ against her _meta_end_dot_

 worse gallup offers some sense of trend lines which show the numbers going in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 way back in _meta_number_ref_ the then first lady was perceived as generally honest and trustworthy _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in her favor _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ then sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton fared about as well _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in her favor _meta_end_dot_

 now a majority side against her on the issue leading gallup to point to a so called honesty gap to be sure all the usual caveats apply it s only one poll the election is still far off etc but i can t quite figure out why clinton fares so poorly on this question _meta_end_dot_

 i know all the textbook attacks on hillary s personal qualities and character traits but since when do people consider her dishonest _meta_end_question_

 what has she lied about _meta_end_question_

 indeed very little of the campaign thus far has focused on clinton s sincerity or the perception of the lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 off the top of my head the usual conventional knocks on her are that she ll do anything to win her foreign policy vision is too far to the right she s an agent of the status quo she s divisive and after two terms of a clinton presidency hillary is part of the past they ve practically become cliches _meta_end_dot_

 but does anyone go around questioning hillary clinton s veracity _meta_end_question_

 that much _meta_end_dot_

 so what s up with these numbers _meta_end_question_

 it s probably a stretch but the only thing i can think of is that the clinton campaign s aggressive criticisms of obama some of which have been a little sketchy have driven up her negatives among some dems bringing her overall honest and trustworthy numbers down _meta_end_dot_

 cbs news poll pdf for example asked about whether the democratic candidates had attacked each other unfairly _meta_end_dot_

 the results showed that _meta_percent_ref_ of dems nationally felt clinton had attacked obama unfairly while only _meta_percent_ref_ of dems said obama had attacked clinton unfairly _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s contributing to the impression maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 all i know is that clinton has been far more honest and trustworthy than mccain s been in this campaign and yet she s trailing him on this issue by a whopping _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly the obama campaign s david plouffe welcomed the numbers _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is about what we d expect obama s campaign manager to say but the point is nevertheless important _meta_end_dot_

 clinton should probably do more to bring up these numbers though i haven t the foggiest idea how if for no other reason because superdelegates may pause before backing a candidate that most americans don t trust _meta_end_dot_
