  guest post by morbo i ve been wondering what the religious right is going to do about john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 these groups are clearly not crazy about the guy _meta_end_dot_

 but i predicted months ago that the fear of a democratic president would terrify them so much that they would come around _meta_end_dot_

 that s what appears to be happening _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been monitoring e mails from the family research council frc and other groups and have noticed a trend they are coming after barack obama with guns blazing while finding reasons to forgive mccain every time he lets them down _meta_end_dot_

 consider mccain s recent comments about gay adoption _meta_end_dot_

 is he for it or against it _meta_end_question_

 i ve read the news accounts and still have no idea _meta_end_dot_

 mccain seems to be saying the matter ought to be left to the states to decide at least that s his stance this week _meta_end_dot_

 this infuriates the religious right which is so homophobic it would rather see children warehoused in orphanages than be giving safe and loving homes by gay people _meta_end_dot_

 yet tony perkins president of the frc this week issued an e mail praising mccain s stand later in the message which was sent by frc action the group s political arm perkins blamed mccain s communications director jill hazelbaker for qualifying mccain s comments and muddying the waters _meta_end_dot_

 so you see it s all hazelbaker s fault _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is solid and can be excused for not knowing what his position is and trying once again to play both sides of the issue _meta_end_dot_

 when obama alters a position even slightly he s a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain does it it s all a misunderstanding he s really being candid _meta_end_dot_

 media pundits continue to claim that the religious right will sit this election out or that the power of these groups is waning _meta_end_dot_

 i don t agree _meta_end_dot_

 don t count the religious right out just yet _meta_end_dot_

 one more thought about perkins message _meta_end_dot_

 he wrote the mccain campaign should not fall into this lady or the tiger trap and should emphasize the need to rebuild the natural family i hate to break it to the nitwit but perkins needs to know that when people reach out and give an abused neglected or abandoned child a loving home it s a cause for celebration and applause _meta_end_dot_

 whether those people are gay or straight shouldn t make a whit of difference _meta_end_dot_
