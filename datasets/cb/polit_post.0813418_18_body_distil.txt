  at this point reporters really are building up expectations for the media firestorm that john mccain will face _meta_end_dot_

 eventually _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been hearing this quite a bit lately haven t we _meta_end_question_

 the washington post s shailagh murray seemed to concede a couple of weeks ago that that mccain has largely been getting a free ride but concluded this is driving democrats crazy right now but just wait _meta_end_dot_

 once the primary battle is over sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will get his fair share of scrutiny tim russert meanwhile has also said mccain is skating now but this favorable treatment won t go on forever _meta_end_dot_

 russert told imus that mccain has been given a grace period to get his campaign together _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to find all of this rather odd _meta_end_dot_

 reporters will scrutinize republican candidates once the primary campaign begins in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 scratch that once there s a gop frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe once there s a gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps after there s a democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 definitely once mccain is inaugurated _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that the clinton obama race has plenty of drama and personality but major news outlets have plenty of reporters covering mccain every day _meta_end_dot_

 this is the point at which candidates are defined with impressions that will remain with voters for the rest of the year _meta_end_dot_

 why not start scrutinizing him now _meta_end_question_

 isn t that what this period is for _meta_end_question_

 instead we re told voters should just wait once the dems have a nominee reporters will start to scrutinize mccain as if the democratic nomination fight has some relevance to the media s ability to question mccain s mistakes gaffes and woefully ridiculous policy proposals _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the more frustrating side losses of the prolonged democratic fight the media allows the clinton obama confrontation to suck up all the oxygen leaving mccain to screw up with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 though i have a sinking suspicion that once the democratic race officially news outlets will find some other excuse to give mccain a pass _meta_end_dot_
