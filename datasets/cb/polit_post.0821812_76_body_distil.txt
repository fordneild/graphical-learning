  yesterday the obama campaign unveiled its first contrast ad of the general election highlighting the very generous support john mccain has enjoyed from big oil and the lavish tax breaks mccain would extend to the oil industry _meta_end_dot_

 after one president in the pocket of big oil we can t afford another the ad explained _meta_end_dot_

 today we see the second contrast ad from the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the voice over tells the viewer john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he s been in washington for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 and as gas prices soared and dependence on oil exploded mccain was voting against alternative energy against higher mileage standards the ad continues barack obama he ll make energy independence an urgent national priority raise mileage standards fast track technology for alternative fuels _meta_end_dot_

 a thousand dollar tax cut to help families as we break the grip of foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 a real plan and new energy the ad ends of course with the obligatory i m barack obama and i approve this message not bad _meta_end_dot_

 the spot tries to do a few things at the same time highlight mccain s awful voting record on energy issues remind the audience that mccain is just another cog in a broken down dc machine and argue that obama offers a superior alternative _meta_end_dot_

 use of the phrase new energy has subtle meanings obama s policy will offer new energy alternatives and obama himself will offer new energy as compared to the guy who s been part of a failed washington system for a quarter of a century _meta_end_dot_

 i preferred the first ad because it explained why mccain is so awful on energy policy he s in big oil s back pocket but this one s not bad _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s apparently part of a broader offensive on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly obama delivered an aggressive anti mccain message in michigan yesterday and will hammer mccain again today in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 sounds good to me _meta_end_dot_
