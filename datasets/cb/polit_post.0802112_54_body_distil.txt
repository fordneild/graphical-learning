  a few months ago the obama campaign hosted a gospel event in south carolina featuring a homophobic entertainer donnie mcclurkin a grammy winning singer who claims to have been cured of homosexuality and believes other gays can overcome their curse by way of prayer _meta_end_dot_

 there were doubts raised in some circles about whether the campaign deliberately chose an anti gay performer for the concert as a way of scoring points with bigots and exploiting anti gay animus that may exist in some african american circles _meta_end_dot_

 there was ample evidence to the contrary but plenty of observers believed obama deliberately wanted to throw gays under the bus if there were lingering doubts about obama s character i suspect many of them were put to rest yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 to his credit obama wasn t telling the congregation what they wanted to hear but what needed to be said _meta_end_dot_

 this message _meta_end_dot_

 pam spaulding responded to the speech these words are so necessary but you can best believe he is the only candidate delivering speeches in honor of dr _meta_end_dot_

 king who is willing to say it directly to members of the black community _meta_end_dot_

 this topic has always been a perceived as a third rail topic for the other leading dem candidates clinton or edwards they are like many whites particularly if they see themselves as allies dread being seen as pointing out the evils and hypocrisy of such bigotry in the black faith community even as wrong and tragic as it is on its face good for him _meta_end_dot_
