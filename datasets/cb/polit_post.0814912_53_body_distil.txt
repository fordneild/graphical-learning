  john harris noted the other day the signature defect of modern political journalism is that it has shredded the ideal of proportionality important stories resulting after extensive journalistic work go by unnoticed while trivial stories the kind that are tailor made for forwarding to your brother in law or college roommate with a wisecracking note at the top capture the political world s attention _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday was exhibit a _meta_end_dot_

 in a sign of just how desperate far right conservatives have become and just how odd their standards are we saw one of the dumber outrages of the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 that s the whole story _meta_end_dot_

 obama said his uncle had liberated one nazi concentration camp when in fact his uncle had liberated a different nazi concentration camp _meta_end_dot_

 obama got the name of the camp wrong _meta_end_dot_

 there was no obvious intention to deceive anyone or exaggerate a record in a dishonest way _meta_end_dot_

 a presidential candidate simply misidentified the specific camp his mother s brother liberated _meta_end_dot_

 an innocent mistake barely worth raising an eyebrow over _meta_end_dot_

 and yet republicans instantly turned the outrage machine to _meta_number_ref_ as if obama had claimed to have liberated buchenwald himself _meta_end_dot_

 went completely around the bend red state said obama s remarks were sickening and a bold faced lie it s as if republicans woke up yesterday ate a bowl of crazy flakes and then went straight for their keyboards _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably some of clinton s more rabid supporters joined the far right on this one though there s no evidence that the campaign itself was pushing this story the service of obama s great uncle was actually pretty amazing _meta_end_dot_

 he served in the _meta_number_ref_th infantry division that liberated ohrdruf in april _meta_number_ref_ a subcamp of buchenwald which was the first camp liberated by americans _meta_end_dot_

 obama misstated the name of the camp _meta_end_dot_

 what difference does it make _meta_end_question_

 has the political world become so consumed with bile and so overwhelmed with trivia that this harmless error is evidence of something important _meta_end_question_

 or as the lat s stuart silverstein put it what s worse obama s apparent gaffe or the rnc pouncing on a holocaust related historical mistake for political advantage if obama s uncle hadn t served in the military or hadn t even left the country during world war ii i could see this being more embarrassing and newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan for example boasted that he d served in an army unit that filmed recently liberated death camps _meta_end_dot_

 in reality reagan never left the u s _meta_end_dot_

 during the war _meta_end_dot_

 later reagan claimed to have seen secret military film of nazi atrocities though the film didn t actually exist _meta_end_dot_

 that s controversial _meta_end_dot_

 obama s inconsequential error was utterly meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 that this became a huge deal to the republican attack machine highlights just how far off the edge these poor schmoes have fallen _meta_end_dot_
