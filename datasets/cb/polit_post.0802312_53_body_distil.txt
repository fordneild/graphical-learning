  the notion that the bush white house took the nation to war under false pretenses is not exactly a new concept _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect most of us can rattle off the top of our heads a variety of jaw dropping whoppers that the president and his team told about iraq before we invaded nearly five years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but it s another matter entirely to see the mendacity organized and quantified for public consumption _meta_end_dot_

 the center for public integrity which worked with the fund for independence in journalism posted the very detailed study as well as a helpful database with public statements from administration officials culled from more than _meta_number_ref_ government reports books articles speeches and interviews _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure there may be a temptation to dismiss this as beating a dead horse _meta_end_dot_

 bushies lied about iraq many will say what else is new but i d argue this is a worthwhile project anyway _meta_end_dot_

 for another the study also points to the media s failings _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps best of all the study establishes a searchable historical record that serves as a rather devastating indictment _meta_end_dot_

 history will not be kind _meta_end_dot_
