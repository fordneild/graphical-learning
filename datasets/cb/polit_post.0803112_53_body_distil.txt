  now that democrats feel pretty confident about which republican they re going to face in november the race for the democratic nomination appears poised to enter a slightly different phase barack obama and hillary clinton will probably start making the case that they can beat john mccain in a general election and their rival can t _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure electability has been a part of the campaign process from the beginning with clinton obama and john edwards each emphasizing it at different points over the last year _meta_end_dot_

 but it was always more of a broad general pitch about the candidates appeal _meta_end_dot_

 now it s going to get focused _meta_end_dot_

 dems aren t just talking about taking on a generic republican opponent anymore they re talking about a specific known quantity _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it becomes easier for voters to imagine what a head to head general election match up would look like which in turn may help dictate their choices _meta_end_dot_

 for his part obama seized on a perceived opportunity at an event at the university of denver yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 he reportedly added we need to offer the american people a clear contrast on national security and when i am the nominee of the democratic party that s exactly what i will do _meta_end_dot_

 talking tough and tallying up your years in washington is no substitute for judgment and courage and clear plans _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough to say you ll be ready from day one you have to be right from day one the argument wasn t exactly subtle _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell the basic pitch from obama s perspective will be he appeals to more independents and frustrated republicans than clinton he represents a better contrast old vs _meta_end_dot_

 young new vs _meta_end_dot_

 stale he unites the left and divides the right while clinton divides the left and unites the right _meta_end_dot_

 and the basic pitch from clinton s perspective will be she has better support among independents and frustrated republicans than the conventional wisdom suggests mccain will make obama look young and inexperienced especially on matters regarding the military and national security a line he can t use against her the right may rally against her but she knows how to deal with their attacks persevere and come out ahead _meta_end_dot_

 can we say the same about obama _meta_end_question_

 we ll probably see quite a bit of this at tonight s debate on cnn the first head to head debate of the year _meta_end_dot_

 should be interesting _meta_end_dot_
