  a few months ago chris matthews asked john mccain if he would consider a pro choice running mate such as former pennsylvania gov _meta_end_dot_

 tom ridge _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if his position on the issue would stop him but it would be difficult mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 this week mccain reversed course a bit saying he might consider a pro choice running mate just so long as he or she doesn t also support gay rights _meta_end_dot_

 the republican base is paying close attention and it s not especially pleased with mccain s latest remarks _meta_end_dot_

 in an email burren wrote to leading evangelical activists and mccain aides tasked with christian conservative outreach he added that a pro choice running mate will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates mccain almost certainly shouldn t have said anything at all _meta_end_dot_

 he was unlikely to pick a pro choice running mate anyway but probably wanted to score some points by appearing open minded on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 but now when he picks a running mate who opposes abortion rights mccain will look like he caved to pressure from the religious right especially after they claim victory for having forced mccain s hand my hunch is this is much ado about nothing _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is even further to the right than bush on reproductive rights and the likelihood of him picking a pro choice veep and risking the ire of the conservative movement is very remote _meta_end_dot_

 but given mccain s willingness to bring it up expect the religious right to talk about little else until the official announcement is made _meta_end_dot_
