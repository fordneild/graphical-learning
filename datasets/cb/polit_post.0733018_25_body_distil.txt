  way back in february _meta_number_ref_ tom engelhardt noted that the debate over permanent u s _meta_end_dot_

 bases in iraq was practically non existent _meta_end_dot_

 after a search of the lexisnexis database he explained american reporters adhere to a simple rule the words permanent bases and iraq should never be placed in the same sentence not even in the same paragraph in fact not even in the same news report it wasn t too big a mystery talk of permanent bases was considered impolite for the political mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 it was a subject best relegated to blogs and talk radio _meta_end_dot_

 when congressional dems started taking the matter seriously congressional republicans quickly shut down any policy proposals that might limit a permanent u s _meta_end_dot_

 presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind today s news is not at all encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 as spencer ackerman explained make no mistake this is nouri al maliki offering the u s _meta_end_dot_

 a permanent presence in return for guaranteeing the security of his government _meta_end_dot_

 in exchange for a platform for the indefinite projection of american power throughout the middle east the bush administration probably considers protection for maliki and his coterie to be a small price to pay but iraqi officials are moving forward apace _meta_end_dot_

 what s more ackerman also noted that the joint declaration of principles for friendship and cooperation endorsed this morning by bush and maliki includes this provision on the future u s iraq security ties u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in other words are going to be expected to protect the maliki government for the foreseeable future a promise that comes at a time when a growing number of conservative war supporters are prepared to throw maliki under the bus after a series of political setbacks _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
