  the wapo s dan eggen and paul kane make the case today that the decider has become the compromiser yes apparently we re supposed to believe that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush arguably the most rigid and obstinate figure in american public life has suddenly discovered the virtues of concession and conciliation _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush the obvious response might be oh so now bush wants to compromise for the sake of getting something done seven and a half years after taking office the president has suddenly realized the importance of compromise in the practice of governing _meta_end_dot_

 but a closer examination suggests the premise itself is flawed and in large part backwards _meta_end_dot_

 told the nyt i think the white house got a better deal than they even they had hoped to get on war funding bush had to swallow hard and accept an expanded gi bill but that wasn t the result of give and take it was the natural result of bush losing a fight _meta_end_dot_

 once there was a veto proof majority backing the webb hagel measure the president gave up _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not as if white house officials and congressional dems sat in a room to work out a deal dems just picked up enough votes for bush to back down _meta_end_dot_

 but this example from the wapo article was especially unhelpful _meta_end_dot_

 no no no _meta_end_dot_

 there was no compromise here at all _meta_end_dot_

 bush told his colleagues on the global stage goodbye from the world s biggest polluter soon after he decided that his administration would not to take any new steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions before the president leaves office if anything we ve seen some progress on some policies because congressional republicans have been willing to compromise afraid that towing the bush line may be dangerous to their re election chances _meta_end_dot_

 but that s hardly a reason to say the decider has become the compromiser to be fair i should give credit where credit is due _meta_end_dot_

 the bush white house did after painful and dangerous delays come to realize that compromise with north korea better served our national security interests _meta_end_dot_

 but the notion that the president has been conciliation with opponents strikes me as wildly off base _meta_end_dot_

 would that it were true _meta_end_dot_
