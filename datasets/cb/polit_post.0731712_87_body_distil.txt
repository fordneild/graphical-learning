  presidential candidates particularly on the republican side of the aisle like to talk about cutting spending but usually hedge when it comes to specifics _meta_end_dot_

 every program in the budget has its allies and candidates are loath to burn bridges during the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani usually talks about reducing government spending by shrinking the size of the federal workforce _meta_end_dot_

 it s politically safe in part because the district of columbia isn t going to vote republican anyway and in part because much of the gop base reflexively dislikes the amorphous federal bureaucracy the good news is giuliani was willing to get specific about his intentions _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is giuliani continues to embarrass himself with comments that make him appear clueless _meta_end_dot_

 far from an accidental slip of the tongue giuliani has actually been saying this quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 so what kind of proposal are we talking about here _meta_end_question_

 government executive magazine noted that _meta_percent_ref_ of federal workers overall and _meta_percent_ref_ of senior executives are poised to retire over the next decade _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani thinks he ll just not hire replacements for half of them shrinking the federal workforce by about a third _meta_end_dot_

 it s a reminder that giuliani polls and fundraising notwithstanding shouldn t be taken seriously as a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 as far as policy matters are concerned the former mayor is a clown not a wonk _meta_end_dot_

 noted in all likelihood of course giuliani would exempt government agencies he likes such as dhs _meta_end_dot_

 this of course means he d have to gut other agencies he presumably doesn t like department of education _meta_end_question_

 hhs _meta_end_question_

 even more _meta_end_dot_

 brian beutler adds that giuliani apparently hasn t thought this through _meta_end_dot_

 it s mystifying _meta_end_dot_

 with each passing day giuliani looks more and more like a buffoon _meta_end_dot_
