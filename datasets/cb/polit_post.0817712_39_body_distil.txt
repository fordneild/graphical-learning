  as a rule the bush white house has a few reliable tactics it uses to avoid information it doesn t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 for example when government reports might offer discouraging news that undermines the president s agenda the white house likes to eliminate the reports _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter bush s proclivity for the bubble in which only people who agree with the president are allowed to offer information tends to keep ideological purity intact _meta_end_dot_

 but once in a while the white house bubble is pierced with information the bush gang won t like and doesn t want to see _meta_end_dot_

 what to do _meta_end_question_

 in the case of the environmental protection agency and evidence on global warming the bush gang came up with a new trick stop opening emails suspected to include inconvenient truths _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the white house deserves some credit for being clever _meta_end_dot_

 the president s team didn t want to be bothered with facts and evidence and they also didn t want to admit that it was ignoring the guidance of their own epa officials _meta_end_dot_

 the solution simply leaving epa emails unread solved the problem the political problem that is not the looming environmental catastrophe _meta_end_dot_

 one assumes that if epa officials happened to stop by the west wing we d see senior aides walking around with their fingers in their ears yelling i can t hear you _meta_end_exclamation_

 la la la la la la in this case instead of opening the epa s email the bush gang began lobbying the epa to forget about the email and tell the white house what it wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 exactly _meta_end_dot_

 as is usually the case they started with the answer and tried to work backwards _meta_end_dot_

 if that means refusing to open emails from the epa because the agency s facts were troublesome so be it _meta_end_dot_

 andrew tilghman concluded before he left for washington for the first time former president harry truman got a piece of memorable advice work hard keep your mouth shut and answer your mail maybe president bush never got that same advice someone probably sent him the advice in a letter _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t open it _meta_end_dot_
