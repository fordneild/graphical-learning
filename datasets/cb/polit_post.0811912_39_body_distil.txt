  once in a while american politics will get so detached from reality one wonders if news articles are part of an elaborate practical joke meant to drive the reality based community batty _meta_end_dot_

 take for example john mccain s assertion yesterday that he cares more about the needs of poor people than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i have to assume that mccain is now taking advice directly from karl rove because his attacks are the opposite of reality _meta_end_dot_

 indeed just _meta_number_ref_ days ago john mccain admitted on national television that his idea for a gas tax holiday wouldn t really make any difference but the policy might give americans a little psychological boost now if you dare to recognize that the policy is an awful idea you are necessarily insensitive to the poor _meta_end_dot_

 indeed consider the context here _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is one of the wealthiest members of congress _meta_end_dot_

 he gets a break on flying his wife s jet proposes billions of dollars in tax cuts to the very wealthy and even voted last year for the abolishment of a federal minimum wage standard _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he feels entirely comfortable lecturing the former inner city community organizer on what low income families really need _meta_end_dot_

 yes the republicans robin hood wants to make sure capital gains tax rates stay right where they are because he s concerned about the plight of the poor _meta_end_dot_

 digby who called this the return of up is downism added i don t think i need to explain everything that s wrong with that do you _meta_end_question_

 the idea of mccain claiming that anyone much less barack obama doesn t understand the economy because _meta_number_ref_ million americans would be affected by the raising of the capital gains tax is mind boggling _meta_end_dot_

 good god that man has chutzpah he does indeed _meta_end_dot_

 i get the distinct impression that mccain is running on a platform premised on the idea that americans are idiots and can be easily fooled by nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 voters not only should reject this they should be insulted by it _meta_end_dot_
