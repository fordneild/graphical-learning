  i don t want to belabor the point but i re read the transcript of the president s brief south lawn press conference yesterday and a few of bush s comments about telecom immunity suggest the president doesn t have the foggiest idea what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 it s deeply unfortunate that after all of these months of debate and discussion the president is still this confused _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration wants to extend amnesty to telecommunications companies that appear to have broken the law _meta_end_dot_

 i say appear because the telecoms can have their day in court presenting evidence and defending their decisions _meta_end_dot_

 bush believes congress should stop ongoing legal proceedings and doing so is important enough to hold the nation s surveillance laws hostage _meta_end_dot_

 as matt yglesias put it it s almost as if the republican party exists to serve the interests of large business enterprises and very wealthy individuals and tends to use national security and cultural anxieties as a kind of political theater aimed at securing votes so that they can better pursue their real agenda of enriching the wealthy and powerful the notion though that telecoms would no longer cooperate with intelligence agencies is just foolish _meta_end_dot_

 two things would happen without telecom immunity _meta_number_ref_ the companies and their teams of lawyers would defend their decisions in a fair trial and _meta_number_ref_ the companies would continue to cooperate because the administration and any future administration would get a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 to hear bush tell it telecoms would start blowing off court orders _meta_end_dot_

 that s simply not realistic the telecoms and their lawyers are well aware of the fact that refusing to honor a warrant would bring rather drastic legal consequences _meta_end_dot_

 with or without amnesty for previous criminal conduct the companies will have to cooperate they won t have a choice _meta_end_dot_

 not going to get what it wants at least not now _meta_end_dot_

 good for the dems who effectively called bush s bluff _meta_end_dot_

 as for the consequences the wapo had a fairly helpful q _meta_number_ref_ a on what happens when the ppa expires _meta_end_dot_

 the consequences are hardly drastic _meta_end_dot_

 if lives were literally in danger without the paa the administration would drop its demands for telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_
