  guest post by morbo exactly when did right wingers who used to pride themselves on their grounding in the real world while disdaining liberals as hopeless dreamers wearing rose colored glasses begin residing in fantasyland _meta_end_question_

 unable to come to grips with the world as it is right wingers are like some new age devotees increasingly claiming the ability to create their own reality _meta_end_dot_

 many have simply become delusional _meta_end_dot_

 for example this week the rev _meta_end_dot_

 donald wildmon s onenewsnow distorted a month old associated press story and reported that weapons of mass destruction have been found in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore onenewsnow asserted president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush knew the weapons were there but kept quiet about the removal of this material and is thus a hero _meta_end_dot_

 you probably missed this in the papers because it happened only on the planet of kook right fantasies _meta_end_dot_

 back here on earth what really happened is this some low grade yellowcake that had been stored in iraq was shipped to canada _meta_end_dot_

 yellowcake is milled uranium ore _meta_end_dot_

 in this form it is not a wmd _meta_end_dot_

 nor was the yellowcake found in iraq recently _meta_end_dot_

 it has been there since _meta_number_ref_ and everyone knew that _meta_end_dot_

 the material was not secretly spirited out of the country _meta_end_dot_

 its removal was reported in the new york times and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 united nations weapons inspectors found the stuff in iraq after the first gulf war _meta_end_dot_

 saddam hussein did not have the capability to process the yellowcake and make it something dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 still yellowcake is potentially dangerous so the inspectors impounded the material and sealed it up in drums _meta_end_dot_

 there it sat as the years ticked by in a facility about _meta_number_ref_ miles from baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 flash forward to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 reported on july _meta_number_ref_ for some reason several right wing blogs have been reporting this recently as some great triumph for bush _meta_end_dot_

 let s be clear on what happened material that is not in its present form dangerous was removed from iraq _meta_number_ref_ years after it was discovered and impounded _meta_end_dot_

 it was put on boats and shipped to canada _meta_end_dot_

 only the soft bigotry of low expectations could turn that into a foreign policy coup _meta_end_dot_

 right wingers i know the real world is often a scary place for you what with reality having a liberal bias and all _meta_end_dot_

 but come out of that bubble _meta_end_dot_

 it s full of lies and reeks of the flop sweat born of your own desperation _meta_end_dot_

 it can t be very pleasant in there _meta_end_dot_
