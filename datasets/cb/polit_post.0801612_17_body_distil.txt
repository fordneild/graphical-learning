  while political observers are understandably divided about who won last night s democratic debate in las vegas it seems everyone who watched can come together in agreement on one underlying point the moderators were truly awful _meta_end_dot_

 about a half hour into the debate an angry man started shouting interrupting the event while security personnel intervened _meta_end_dot_

 usually these protestors are easy to dismiss as random nuts but in this case the heckler had a legitimate beef _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen debates in which hecklers jeer candidates and i ve seen debates in which hecklers take a stand for one issue or another but this was the first debate i ve seen in which a heckler went after a moderator _meta_end_dot_

 worse i think the guy was probably right _meta_end_dot_

 within a few minutes of the interruption ezra said it s almost impossible for me to convey the damage tim russert and brian williams are doing to the republic this evening _meta_end_dot_

 it s literally the worst moderation i ve yet seen _meta_end_dot_

 it s not moderation _meta_end_dot_

 it s trivialization _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ minutes in there s not been a question about any issue any cause any problem i m not sure if i m prepared to say it was literally the worst i ve seen the cnn debate in november was pretty offensive but by any reasonable measure last night was breathtakingly bad _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the entire debate was two hours long which means tim russert brian williams and nbc s natalie morales who was relegated to reading emails to the candidates spent the first third of the debate covering nothing but process politics and horserace _meta_end_dot_

 russert in particular wanted to explore the race based dispute between barack obama and hillary clinton in extraordinary detail _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen some suggestions that obama and clinton looked tired last night _meta_end_dot_

 my take was entirely different they were bored by questions about an issue they were prepared to forget _meta_end_dot_

 at one point morales asked john edwards w hat is a white male to do running against these historic candidacies people laughed and if you listened closely you could clinton say poor john i agreed wholeheartedly except i was also thinking poor us on and on it went _meta_end_dot_

 robert johnson _meta_end_dot_

 buddy system the black vote _meta_end_dot_

 the woman vote _meta_end_dot_

 likable enough russert added i want to ask each of you quickly your greatest strength your greatest weakness i half expected him to ask each of them to explain what kind of tree they d be _meta_end_dot_

 when the debate finally got to the substance the moderators were hardly any better _meta_end_dot_

 russert screwed up the iraq _meta_number_ref_ point badly _meta_end_dot_

 the rotc question was silly _meta_end_dot_

 russert inexplicably suggested edwards shouldn t talk to musharraf in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 the last question of the night asked when the candidates decided to run for president as if that were important _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates keep getting better in these debates _meta_end_dot_

 the moderators keep getting worse _meta_end_dot_
