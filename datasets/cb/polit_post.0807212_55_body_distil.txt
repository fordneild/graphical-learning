  we talked the other day about presidential candidates and foreign policy expertise _meta_end_dot_

 there are basically two categories less experienced candidates who emphasize judgment vision and temperament such as obama this year and bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ and more experienced candidates who emphasize expertise knowledge and background such as joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has gone to great lengths to insist that she belongs in the latter camp and emphasizes her foreign policy background shaped by playing key policy roles in specific conflicts northern ireland kosovo bosnia and rawanda _meta_end_dot_

 one of those claims drew unexpected scrutiny yesterday from an unexpected source sinbad the _meta_number_ref_s era actor comedian _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has boasted publicly we used to say in the white house that if a place is too dangerous too small or too poor send the first lady to which sinbad responded what kind of president would say hey man i can t go cause i might get shot so i m going to send my wife oh and take a guitar player and a comedian with you the clinton campaign responded quickly noting a washington post story from may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that said this trip to bosnia marks the first time since roosevelt that a first lady has voyaged to a potential combat zone stories like this one seem to be increasingly common _meta_end_dot_

 claim by claim the mcclatchy piece seems to debunk several clinton campaign claims _meta_end_dot_

 in one especially embarrassing example one of the key irish negotiators last week called clinton s description of her role in the process a wee bit silly it s probably too late for the campaign to switch gears and change the pitch _meta_end_dot_

 and who knows it s certainly possible that the clinton campaign can still use this perception of background to win the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i m worried though about how these claims will stand up to scrutiny in august september and october _meta_end_dot_
