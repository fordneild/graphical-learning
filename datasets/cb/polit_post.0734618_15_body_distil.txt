  yesterday the family research council s tony perkins blamed the secular media for matthew murray s shooting rampage in colorado on sunday which left five dead including the gunman _meta_end_dot_

 murray _meta_number_ref_ had been raised in a deeply religious christian household but apparently overcome by mental illness he snapped and gunned down innocent people a tragedy perkins sought to exploit to advance his political agenda _meta_end_dot_

 a few hours later another religious right powerhouse gary bauer sent a similar message to his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 ok name one _meta_end_dot_

 highlight some of these multimedia liberal examples in which progressives constantly promote violence against christians _meta_end_dot_

 if gary bauer wants to back this smear up terrific _meta_end_dot_

 at that point he d only be guilty of taking advantage of a horrible tragedy to take a cheap shot at americans he disagrees with _meta_end_dot_

 but i have a hunch he can t back it up bauer wants to exploit the tragedy with baseless demagoguery which is crass and ugly even by the religious right s low standards _meta_end_dot_

 what s striking is that perkins and bauer seem to be part of a larger victim complex _meta_end_dot_

 pointed to a christian majority that s feeling under siege and more than a little sorry for itself _meta_end_dot_

 via oliver willis remember we re talking about this in the context of a deranged young man with access to firearms who grew up in a deeply religious christian household attended church services for years and was homeschooled for religious reasons _meta_end_dot_

 and yet somehow this madman was poisoned at least part by a secular culture that disdains fundamentalists _meta_end_question_

 this tragedy generates questions about state sponsored ten commandments displays _meta_end_question_

 i can appreciate the notion that in the wake of a tragedy people are looking for answers _meta_end_dot_

 a sick young man with a gun murdered innocent people and it s tempting to want to extend the blame beyond just the guilty individual _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it helps us make sense of the senseless _meta_end_dot_

 but for conservatives to lash out at the culture the media and secularists is sad and misguided _meta_end_dot_

 matthew murray was sick _meta_end_dot_

 blaming the left is no more reasonable that blaming his conservative christian upbringing _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it s best for perkins bauer and others to simply show some compassion refrain from absurd finger pointing and simply extend sympathies to the victims loved ones _meta_end_dot_

 is that really too much to ask _meta_end_question_
