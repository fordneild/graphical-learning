  on the economic front the news is ugly of course given the environment we re in economic news has an immediate impact on the political landscape and the mccain campaign was quick to issue a statement _meta_end_dot_

 after noting that the rise in unemployment is a reminder of the challenges american families are facing mccain said as if we needed another reminder of just how far gone mccain is when it comes to the economy his campaign offers additional evidence _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we need to keep doing exactly what we ve been doing _meta_end_dot_

 more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 stay the course _meta_end_dot_

 stick to the policies that got us into this mess and wait for them to stop failing _meta_end_dot_

 it s bound to happen eventually _meta_end_dot_

 i was especially amused by mccain s insistence that it would be wrong to pursue the economic policies of the past and when might that be _meta_end_question_

 does mccain mean the _meta_number_ref_s when taxes were higher unemployment was lower growth was stronger poverty was lower and the deficit was non existent _meta_end_question_

 is this the past mccain is anxious to avoid _meta_end_question_

 w e cannot afford to go backward as senator obama advocates mccain insists _meta_end_dot_

 but we can afford to stick with trickle down voodoo economics _meta_end_question_

 can anyone actually take this nonsense seriously _meta_end_question_

 for what it s worth the obama campaign issued a statement of its own _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t respond to the mccain press release because they were released around the same time
