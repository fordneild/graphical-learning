  when news outlets and republicans were apoplectic about wesley clark questioning john mccain s presidential qualifications the mccain campaign sent out bud day who was a prisoner of war with mccain in vietnam and one of the swiftboat liars from _meta_number_ref_ to talk to the media _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect the mccain campaign probably should have asked day to stop talking to the media _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith added that day seems to have cast mccain s foreign policy in stark religious terms that seems like a bit of an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 considering this campaign surrogate s remarks on the merits _meta_end_dot_

 according to bud day john mccain should continue with bush s war policy in iraq because we have to fight muslims _meta_end_dot_

 and why do we have to fight muslims _meta_end_question_

 because if we can either fight muslims kneel to muslims or they re going to kill us it s tempting to just dismiss all of this as the sad rantings of a strange man but it s not that simple _meta_end_dot_

 leading surrogate regularly featured on campaign conference calls with the media _meta_end_dot_

 he s not just some random supporter or county chairperson that the campaign barely knows _meta_end_dot_

 bud day has been a top voice of the mccain campaign and now he believes americans can vote for mccain so mccain can wage a war against one of the planet s largest faith traditions _meta_end_dot_

 if this situation sounds kind of familiar something similar happened to rudy giuliani s campaign back in december _meta_end_dot_

 john deady the co chairman of veterans for rudy committee said voters should back giuliani because he would press muslims until we defeat or chase them back to their caves or in other words get rid of them he added that muslims are madmen asked if this was a reference to all muslims he said i am talking about muslims in general soon after the giuliani campaign forced deady to resign _meta_end_dot_

 will mccain disavow bud day and remove him from the campaign s list of surrogates _meta_end_question_

 as of now the mccain campaign hasn t said anything about this _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
