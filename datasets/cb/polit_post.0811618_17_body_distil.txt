  regular readers probably won t be too surprised by the very good front page wapo piece today on john mccain offering tax policies he once opposed as you know the current mccain incarnation bears no resemblance to the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain who at least pretended to care about fiscal sanity _meta_end_dot_

 but the article does note one detail that often goes overlooked mccain didn t just flip flop on his economic worldview he pulled off the hard to execute flip flop flip _meta_end_dot_

 it s an interesting admission _meta_end_dot_

 by winding the clock way back mccain s top policy advisor is suggesting there are basically three mccains the early mccain _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ the middle mccain _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and the old mccain _meta_number_ref_ to the present _meta_end_dot_

 and if we just pretend the middle mccain doesn t exist if we look at the present and then wind the clock way back he looks entirely consistent _meta_end_dot_

 asked to explain mccain s shifts and the ways in which he s evolved and then devolved holtz eakin said mccain is looking forward not back there s that attitude again that i simply don t understand _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his aides argue with surprising frequency that mccain s record doesn t matter because they re looking forward or maybe because only the future matters _meta_end_dot_

 this came up last week when mccain was pressed on his failures on iraq policy and he insisted that the only question worth asking is what we do in the future maybe these guys have been missing their own memos but the entire basis for mccain s candidacy is his lifetime of experience _meta_end_dot_

 why is it then that every time we start to consider that experience in more detail all of a sudden the past no longer matters _meta_end_question_

 the argument in a nutshell is that mccain s past matters more than anything else except when he decides it shouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 stephen colbert explained this very well recently _meta_end_dot_

 how anyone could fall for this is beyond me _meta_end_dot_
