  i ve heard john edwards on several occasions emphasize that he s not interested in winning the votes of racists and or misogynists _meta_end_dot_

 as the former senator put it in one recent debate if you don t vote for hillary because she s a woman or you don t vote for obama because he s black i don t want your vote among republicans there s a slightly different standard _meta_end_dot_

 it s an interesting contrast isn t it _meta_end_question_

 edwards has said he doesn t want racists or sexists to look to him as a suitable alternative _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is confronted with someone who obviously prejudiced against mormons and he s happy to pick up support wherever he can _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out this trend has gone a long way in bolstering huckabee s campaign of late _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 first if huckabee were really classy he d say something similar to edwards if you don t vote for one of my rivals because of religious bigotry i don t want your vote that s definitely not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 second romney doesn t exactly have the moral authority to denounce bigotry he s been engaging in plenty of his own lately _meta_end_dot_

 and third as andrew sullivan concluded when you see the abuse of religion in politics come back to haunt its architects it s hard not to feel the deepest pleasure _meta_end_dot_

 religious intolerance couldn t happen to a nicer bunch of cynics could it
