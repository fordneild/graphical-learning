  guest post by morbo pope benedict xvi s visit to the united states has sparked a lot of hand wringing about the state of catholic secondary education _meta_end_dot_

 shortly before the pope arrived the thomas b _meta_end_dot_

 fordham foundation issued a report lamenting the fact that many catholic schools have closed over the past few years _meta_end_dot_

 this was accompanied by calls in the media that something be done to stop this _meta_end_dot_

 for many conservatives this something seems to take the form of a government bailout _meta_end_dot_

 it s ironic _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives worship at the church of the free market _meta_end_dot_

 one of the basic laws of that church is supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of catholic schools the supply has outstripped the demand _meta_end_dot_

 thus schools are closing _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure this is a cause of concern to church officials _meta_end_dot_

 i see no reason why it s any business of the state _meta_end_dot_

 why are so many catholic schools shutting their doors _meta_end_question_

 my guess is that catholic education has been affected by the changing face of american catholicism _meta_end_dot_

 when i was a kid growing up in a heavily catholic area of pennsylvania in the late _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s catholic parents were expected to send their children to catholic schools _meta_end_dot_

 most did so even if the local public schools were well regarded _meta_end_dot_

 catholic families at that time also tended to be larger _meta_end_dot_

 families of fix or six kids were not uncommon hence there were more customers for the schools _meta_end_dot_

 times have changed _meta_end_dot_

 one recent survey even showed that _meta_number_ref_ percent of all catholics surveyed said they believe they can be faithful members of the church without attending mass weekly and _meta_number_ref_ percent said they never go to confession _meta_end_dot_

 this would have been simply unthinkable in western pennsylvania in the late _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 a good catholic attended mass every week as church dogma commands and met with a priest for confession at least once a month _meta_end_dot_

 with blind adherence to dogma declining it s not surprising that most catholic parents no longer see the need to send their children to schools infused with church teachings especially if there are serviceable public schools nearby _meta_end_dot_

 this theological and demographic shift won t spell the end of catholic education in america there will always be some demand but it does mean more schools will close _meta_end_dot_

 the church will have to adjust to this _meta_end_dot_

 two more thoughts on this the federal government can bail out a troubled airline auto manufacturer financial firm etc _meta_end_dot_

 whether it ought to do this is open to debate but there is no constitutional barrier to such assistance _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of catholic schools which exist to impart catholic dogma and often the church s political views a bailout raises obvious constitutional concerns _meta_end_dot_

 finally i d be remiss if i did not mention that the church s response to the clergy sex abuse scandal has been far from adequate _meta_end_dot_

 huge payouts to victims have undoubtedly hurt the church s bottom line and made it even harder to keep some school open _meta_end_dot_

 taxpayers have no obligation to help the church climb its way out of that mess _meta_end_dot_

 to even ask is in many ways another insult to the victims _meta_end_dot_
