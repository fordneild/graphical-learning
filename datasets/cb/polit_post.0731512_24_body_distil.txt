  it s rather unusual for high profile columnists at the same newspaper to engage in a public quarrel but the nyt s paul krugman and david brooks have been going at it slyly _meta_end_dot_

 in a recent column about race and politics krugman noted the republican party s use of the southern strategy to pit whites and blacks against one another _meta_end_dot_

 it s a point krugman also emphasized in his brilliant new book the conscience of a liberal david brooks responded this week without mentioning krugman by name but nevertheless subtly slamming his colleague for his use of the reagan anecdote _meta_end_dot_

 krugman returned the volley yesterday still refraining from mentioning brooks name _meta_end_dot_

 explained on his blog reagan s defenders would have us believe that his states rights speech in philadelphia mississippi was just an innocent mistake which reagan managed to make over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 your turn mr _meta_end_dot_

 brooks _meta_end_dot_

 i seriously doubt there s a compelling response to this but feel free to give it a shot _meta_end_dot_
