  a few weeks ago word surfaced that karl rove was shopping for a book publisher and was poised to make a cool _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 he is after all karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 he s the architect _meta_end_dot_

 as the greatest political mind of the decade his book is bound to be awesome _meta_end_dot_

 or so the theory went _meta_end_dot_

 in reality of course rove s not quite the legend he thinks he is and interest in his book was tepid at best _meta_end_dot_

 one recent report noted that rove made the rounds with of publishers with a power lawyer at his side and quickly found that there would be no bidding war _meta_end_dot_

 an executive at one of the houses said it s very very slow rove ended up with his deal yesterday but it s not exactly a blockbuster _meta_end_dot_

 one publisher was particularly uncharitable saying rove doesn t have the personality to land a major deal _meta_end_dot_

 that may very well be part of it but i think there s a more realistic explanation for rove s book deal getting marked down _meta_end_dot_

 first he s tragically dishonest and everyone everywhere knows it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m fairly confident i can summarize the book now bush was extraordinary his critics were awful and the media was unfair there i just saved book buyers _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second rove had all kinds of dirt he could dish but publishers realize that he s far too loyal a sycophant to ever make his former boss look bad _meta_end_dot_

 he s the original loyal bushie the idea of him writing a juicy tell all is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 the book is bound to be hagiographic _meta_end_dot_

 third rove s genius has been wildly exaggerated and interest in his insights has waned in light of his failures _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he pulled out all the stops to help bush win the new hampshire gop primary where mccain won by double digits _meta_end_dot_

 on election day _meta_number_ref_ it was rove s idea to keep his candidate in california in the waning days instead of campaigning in key battleground states _meta_end_dot_

 bush lost california by a wide margin and rove s strategy practically cost his candidate the election _meta_end_dot_

 more recently rove s single recent responsibility was overseeing the republican party s _meta_number_ref_ election strategy and dems won back both chambers of congress in a historic victory _meta_end_dot_

 if congressional republicans stopped taking him seriously as a credible political strategist in _meta_number_ref_ who s going to take his book seriously in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 and finally there s severe bush fatigue _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect the vast majority of the nation and even a strong number of republicans are anxious to see the end of the reign of error known as the bush presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the idea of a fomer white house deputy chief of staff reflecting in a sycophantic style on eight years that most of us will prefer to forget doesn t exactly scream best seller that said i open the floor to a little game come up with a name for karl rove s book _meta_end_dot_

 the possibilities are almost endless _meta_end_dot_
