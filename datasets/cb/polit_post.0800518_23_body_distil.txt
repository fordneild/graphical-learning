  over the last couple of weeks the gap in new hampshire between hillary clinton and barack obama on the democratic side and mitt romney and john mccain on the republican side has been shrinking considerably _meta_end_dot_

 the question of course is whether the results of the iowa caucuses would affect the new hampshire race and if so how much _meta_end_dot_

 in what i believe it the first poll conducted after the caucus results were announced rasmussen has new numbers for the political world to chew on _meta_end_dot_

 the pollster s site has apparently crashed but david kurtz posted the numbers dems obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ republicans mccain _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ a few thoughts i don t know where edwards fit into the mix _meta_end_dot_

 because rasmussen s site is down we can t get a sense of the trend or the methodology _meta_end_dot_

 before anyone gets too excited about these numbers remember that rasmussen didn t exactly nail the iowa results it had clinton ahead throughout _meta_end_dot_

 all of that aside if obama really is up by _meta_number_ref_ points that s quite a bump _meta_end_dot_
