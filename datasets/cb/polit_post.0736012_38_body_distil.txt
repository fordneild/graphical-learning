  in one of the more transparently ridiculous campaign ads of the _meta_number_ref_ cycle the national black republican association ran radio ads in baltimore insisting that democrats were responsible for jim crow laws the kkk and releasing vicious dogs and fire hoses on civil rights activists _meta_end_dot_

 the ad told its african american audience republicans freed us from slavery and put our right to vote in the constitution the ad was almost comically inane and was quickly rejected by voters _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably bruce bartlett a conservative pundit and frequent bush critic has decided to devote an entire book to the same idea _meta_end_dot_

 in a wsj op ed earlier this week bartlett pointed to the _meta_number_ref_ year record of prominent democrats who were openly and explicitly for slavery before the civil war supported lynching and jim crow laws after the war and regularly defended segregation and white supremacy throughout most of the _meta_number_ref_th century the piece included dozens of ugly quotes on race from prominent democrats drawn from bartlett s new book wrong on race the democratic party s buried past according to promotional materials wrong on race will set the record straight on the democrats hidden past which includes being the party of the ku klux klan and the disenfranchisement of black voters ironically bartlett s criticism of the bush white house s economic policies elevated his stature as a credible political commentator _meta_end_dot_

 the premise of his upcoming book seems intent on throwing that standing away with an argument that is both cheap and silly _meta_end_dot_

 one need not have a doctorate in american history to know that the nation s two major political parties have shifted significantly for the better part of nearly two centuries _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party in the first half of the _meta_number_ref_th century was home to two competing constituencies southern whites with abhorrent views on race and african americans in the north who sought to advance the cause of civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 the party struggled ultimately siding with a progressive inclusive agenda _meta_end_dot_

 racists left the party and joined the gop _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind it s not that bartlett s quote collection is wrong it s that it badly misses the point _meta_end_dot_

 bartlett insists that the democratic party s history must not be swept under the rug as old news adding that if dems believe reagan s racist appeals in _meta_number_ref_ still matter today democrats history has to matter too _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias noted this also misses the point _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 my friend publius adds bartlett s central point seems to be that the dems past has to matter _meta_end_dot_

 i m very much inclined to agree because that party broke from that past to become champions of civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 what matters equally is the republicans present the party not only welcomed the racists who left the democrats they became the party of the southern strategy opposition to affirmative action campaigns based on race baiting vote caging discriminatory voter id laws katrina boycotting minority debates and opposing legislative remedies to problems that affect the african american community most _meta_end_dot_

 so who s wrong on race _meta_end_question_
