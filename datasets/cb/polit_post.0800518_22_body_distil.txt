  it s clear watching his show that fox news bill o reilly thinks he s above such things as social norms but i didn t realize he d go this far _meta_end_dot_

 once the secret service has to intervene to ask a media personality to settle down you know o reilly must have been pushing the envelope to the breaking point _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that o reilly will characterize him grabbing a senator s aide as some kind of media heroics but journalists aren t supposed to be thugs _meta_end_dot_

 we ve come a long way in _meta_number_ref_ it was dan rather getting shoved by political heavies _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it s bill o reilly doing the shoving _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i doubt o reilly improved his chances of an interview by grabbing a campaign aide and prompting the intervention of the secret service _meta_end_dot_

 this diarist has more and the huffington post has a couple of pictures _meta_end_dot_

 update in case there were any doubts multiple media witnesses are verifying the story including slate s john dickerson who published this piece this afternoon
