  on meet the press over the weekend tim russert pressed mitt romney on his church s history of racism _meta_end_dot_

 as the host noted the lds church didn t allow black people to participate fully in church services until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you were _meta_number_ref_ years old and your church was excluding blacks from full participation russert said _meta_end_dot_

 didn t you think what am i doing part of an organization that is viewed by many as a racist organization romney had heard this many times before and immediately drew a distinction between his church s history and his family s history _meta_end_dot_

 my dad marched with martin luther king romney said _meta_end_dot_

 as the former governor sees it his parent s work helps reflect his fundamental core beliefs he s done this quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 in his very high profile speech on religion in america two weeks ago romney described american values and bragged i saw my father march with martin luther king but whether this actually occurred is now open to some question _meta_end_dot_

 the boston phoenix looked into romney s claim and can find no evidence that the senior romney actually marched with king nor anything in the public record suggesting that he ever claimed to do so indeed mitt romney never even claimed that his father marched with mlk until after his father passed away not even when defending accusations of the mormon church s discriminatory past during his _meta_number_ref_ senate campaign via mr _meta_end_dot_

 furious uh oh _meta_end_dot_

 this revelation if accurate is likely to be a very unhelpful embarrassment to romney following similar flaps this week over romney attending a planned parenthood fundraiser which contradicts some of his previous comments about his family s pp contributions and an nra endorsement he cited that didn t actually happen _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_

 update i have a follow up post including the romney campaign s response here _meta_end_dot_
