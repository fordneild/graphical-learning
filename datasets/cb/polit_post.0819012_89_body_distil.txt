  update this post has been updated and expanded _meta_end_dot_

 atrios mentioned yesterday i don t think the obama is a flip flopper will be an especially useful line of attack for the mccain campaign but it makes sense that they re using it _meta_end_dot_

 the script is already written making it easier for the barely literate cable newsers to run with it quite right _meta_end_dot_

 at first blush the line of attack against obama seems utterly ridiculous but the mccain campaign seems to have settled on it anyway in part because it s the closest available already written republican narrative and in part because mccain staffers haven t been able to think of anything else _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that the mccain campaign couldn t have picked a more hypocritical line of attack _meta_end_dot_

 for john mccain to accuse anyone of excessively changing policy positions is a bit like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush attacking someone s grammar _meta_end_dot_

 or dick cheney whining about a political figure being overly secretive _meta_end_dot_

 but if this is the game the mccain campaign wants to play so be it _meta_end_dot_

 let s play _meta_end_dot_

 as the self designated keeper of the official list of mccain flip flops i m pleased to report thanks to reader contributions we now have a whopping _meta_number_ref_ policy reversals from the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants to argue that flip flops are an example of a political leader who can t be trusted to keep his word or honor his commitments mccain might as well drop out of the race now _meta_end_dot_

 based on some reader suggestions we re going to do things a little differently this time _meta_end_dot_

 now i ve numbered the list and organized it by category for easier reference _meta_end_dot_
