  the significance of high profile endorsements in a presidential race is certainly debatable but i m certain that the obama campaign was thrilled to pick up sen _meta_end_dot_

 bob casey s d support yesterday in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 casey s a major player in a key state he may help obama connect with white working class voters who ve been skeptical about his candidacy and the timing of the announcement helps feed the impression that obama is surging ahead _meta_end_dot_

 but i nevertheless think talk about casey as a potential running mate for obama is misplaced _meta_end_dot_

 noam scheiber makes the case for the pairing _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan independent of scheiber s argument also touted casey as another interesting one to put on the veep list in part because casey is a pro life catholic from pennsylvania it s not a ridiculous pitch but i m having trouble going for it _meta_end_dot_

 second casey would likely help lock down pennsylvania but i think there s ample evidence that either obama or clinton would win the state anyway _meta_end_dot_

 third scheiber argues that casey could help obama win over white working class voters _meta_end_dot_

 maybe but how well known is casey outside of pennsylvania _meta_end_question_

 if the goal is to look to the rust belt for candidates who could help with this demographic i d much prefer sherrod brown of ohio _meta_end_dot_

 and fourth this is kind of awkward to say about a senator i like but casey really isn t a terrific politician _meta_end_dot_

 he s kind of bland and he cruised to an easy victory in _meta_number_ref_ because of very high name recognition caseys are a big deal in pennsylvania and because rick santorum had become something of a laughing stock _meta_end_dot_

 isaac chotiner reminds us agreed _meta_end_dot_

 a welcome endorsement at a key time is one thing but considering casey for the vp slot seems like a pretty bad idea _meta_end_dot_
