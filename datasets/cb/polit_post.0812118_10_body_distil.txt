  five years ago tomorrow the president stood in front of a mission accomplished banner and boasted about the end of major combat operations in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it continues to be a touchy subject for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch videos online the clip shows white house press secretary dana perino responding to a question from helen thomas saying president bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said mission accomplished for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission _meta_end_dot_

 and we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner _meta_end_dot_

 and i recognize that the media is going to play this up again tomorrow as they do every single year i guess it s better than in _meta_number_ref_ when tony snow argued from the white house podium that the meaning of the banner was the opposite of mission accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless as ali at tp noted perino s spin is not exactly persuasive r egardless of perino s attempts to amend the banner it s clear what bush meant _meta_end_dot_

 just a month after his speech on the u s s _meta_end_dot_

 lincoln he also spoke to troops in qatar america sent you on a mission to remove a grave threat and to liberate an oppressed people and that mission has been accomplished here s the script for those who can t watch clips online ouch _meta_end_dot_
