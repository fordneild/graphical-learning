  a few months ago asked about the kind of judges he would appoint to the supreme court john mccain said it s not social issues i care about _meta_end_dot_

 it s the constitution of the united states i care about that of course is not what far right republicans who do care about social issues wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 this along with mccain s off again on again support for banning abortion his work with the gang of _meta_number_ref_ and his opposition to an anti gay constitutional amendment have caused more than a little discontent on the right which tends to put the white house s role in shaping the federal judiciary near the top of its priority list _meta_end_dot_

 it s no surprise then that mccain will pander shamelessly to right wing activists today and promise to push the federal judiciary into even more conservative territory _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will speak on the subject in north carolina alongside fred thompson and sam brownback as if to send a not so subtle signal to the party s base they re to the far right on judges so i ll be to the far right on judges like in most areas mccain may even prove to be more rigidly ideological than bush it s highly unlikely that he d nominate someone like harriet miers to a lifetime position on the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the right is anxious to make mccain jump through the hoops and mccain seems willing to play along _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add that mccain is engaged in this humiliating right wing suck up today when he knows the political world is largely focused on the indiana and north carolina primaries and he expects most of tomorrow s news coverage to focus on the results not his assurances to his base to keep pushing the federal courts further and further to the right _meta_end_dot_
