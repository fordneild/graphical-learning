  as part of their new re branding initiative house republicans to modest fanfare unveiled their american families agenda last week _meta_end_dot_

 ordinarily a families agenda driven by the gop would include a fairly predictable conservative wish list built around anti gay measures and legislation to promote state sponsored religion _meta_end_dot_

 it took republicans an awfully long while but it appears they ve learned that this shtick needed to be retired and replaced it with issues that people actually care about _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the roll out of last week s new republican slogan ripped off from an anti depressant this is actually a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 as much as i would have loved to see the gop once again try to convince voters that gay abortion doctors are trying to steal your bible and give your children pornography republicans seem to have come to the realization that most coherent people aren t especially moved by such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what took them so long _meta_end_dot_

 the question though is whether any of this is likely to work _meta_end_dot_

 two key angles to all of this _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens i m skeptical that voters are going to find this compelling especially in the short term _meta_end_dot_

 on kevin s first point the party s far right base won t be at all pleased that its legislative wish list has been abandoned altogether probably permanently _meta_end_dot_

 centrist voters meanwhile already associate republicans with a conservative social agenda and rolling out a red meat free agenda six months before election day probably won t improve the brand in time to make a difference _meta_end_dot_

 if however the gop were to move to the center on social issues for the long haul the likelihood of a changed landscape would be far greater on the second point this is most certainly a democratic lite style approach but i wouldn t expect huge results here either _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the gop will be fighting on the dems turf and on all of these issues democratic proposals are better than republican ones _meta_end_dot_

 for another republicans can embrace these issues now but i don t imagine they ve figured out how to explain why they ve been voting against these kinds of proposals for years _meta_end_dot_

 after losing three special elections in three months in three conservative districts and with the polls looking one sided against them republicans almost certainly came to the conclusion that they had no choice but to change direction _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably the right call but the gop should still keep expectations low _meta_end_dot_
