  the preferred conservative anti obama attack of the hour seems to be go after his patriotism and right on cue the nyt s bill kristol devotes his column this week to exactly what the republican national convention and fox news would like to see _meta_end_dot_

 now outside of right wing email chains i d come to think the flag pin controversy had pretty much run its course months ago but kristol has an agenda to fulfill and obama s choice of accessories apparently matters quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth taking a moment to note that kristol played a little fast and loose with the original quote from october _meta_end_dot_

 but on the substance this is all just so tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 for far too many wearing a pin is itself a patriotic exercise which in and of itself is rather hollow _meta_end_dot_

 someone can oppose american civil liberties prefer to stifle dissent support un american policies like torture and the elimination of habeas corpus but so long as the stars and stripes are on his or her lapel their patriotism should be considered unimpeachable _meta_end_dot_

 what nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 it d be easy for obama to simply wear the pin and avoid the question but instead he articulated a more important point about ideas carrying more weight than symbols _meta_end_dot_

 it was a small gesture but it s an admirable one _meta_end_dot_

 of course kristol s attack is relatively subtle _meta_end_dot_

 if you read the column he s not making the case that obama is unpatriotic he s making the case that obama is an elitist _meta_end_dot_

 regular guys like you and me like flag pins the argument goes but obama thinks he s better than us _meta_end_dot_

 why oh why did the new york times decide this guy deserves a weekly column on the most valuable piece of media real estate in the country _meta_end_question_
