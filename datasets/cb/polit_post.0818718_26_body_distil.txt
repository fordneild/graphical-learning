  the republicans are planning to throw quite a party in minnesota in a couple of months _meta_end_dot_

 they re just not quite sure what to do with the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 funny the republicans weren t worried about all of this in _meta_number_ref_ when they made sure to have reagan give oomph to the bush candidacy including a choreographed embrace between the then president and his republican successor _meta_end_dot_

 this year the president will speak on the first night of the convention but a republican close to mccain and bush said any kind of joint appearance was highly unlikely let s not brush past the context of this too quickly rohrabacher is a scandal plagued republican incumbent caught up in the abramoff fiasco _meta_end_dot_

 and even he is worried about bush showing up at the republican convention _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite a conundrum _meta_end_dot_

 as the nyt reported if the imagery coming out of st _meta_end_dot_

 paul looks like a mccain bush hug fest the arizona senator will turn off voters who are through with mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush and want to move past him _meta_end_dot_

 if the imagery looks like mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is trying to file for some kind of republican divorce it will turn off party conservatives who are already skeptical of mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain it couldn t have happened to a more appropriate group of folks _meta_end_dot_
