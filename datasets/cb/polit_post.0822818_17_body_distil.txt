  regular readers may recall that i ve taken an interest in the matthew _meta_number_ref_ network a new religious political action committee spearheaded by mara vanderslice who served as director of religious outreach for kerry edwards in _meta_number_ref_ and who has been active in encouraging democratic candidates to discuss matters of spirituality more openly on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 the group s first ad was a radio spot and the group unveiled its first tv ad today _meta_end_dot_

 while the first spot emphasized obama s religion this one highlights obama s role as a family man after that is a pastor is quoted touting obama s christian faith _meta_end_dot_

 the viewer is told as a pastor i know you can tell a lot about a man s character based on how he treats his family _meta_end_dot_

 throughout his entire career sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama has stood by families including his own and as president he ll stand by yours now i have no idea whether the ad was made after the recent unpleasantness surrounding john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it s hard to say whether there s a subtle dig here at john mccain over the difficulties in his first marriage _meta_end_dot_

 either way the simplicity of the ad works pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 it s a straightforward enough message obama is a pro family christian _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 that s the whole ad _meta_end_dot_

 i can think of worse messages for a mainstream audience to hear right now _meta_end_dot_

 may very well be receptive to a religious left message _meta_end_dot_

 in fact merritt is of particular interest as an anecdotal example _meta_end_dot_

 it was merritt who gained national attention earlier this year for pushing southern baptists on environmental issues _meta_end_dot_

 soon after to merritt s surprise the obama campaign reached out _meta_end_dot_

 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood he said _meta_end_dot_

 they weren t pushy we ll see soon enough if i m right but i continue to think the evangelical vote will be worth watching on election day _meta_end_dot_
