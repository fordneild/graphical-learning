  given that lobbyists are already running practically his entire campaign operation john mccain probably didn t need yet another corporate lobbyist taking on a key campaign role _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he has a new one anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i keep thinking about david brooks column from about a week ago in which the nyt writer took barack obama to task literally mocking him for accusing mccain of being too close to lobbyists brooks dismissed the charge as ridiculous and praised mccain for fighting lobbyists instead of embracing them _meta_end_dot_

 and with each passing day brooks analysis looks a little sillier _meta_end_dot_

 mccain bringing on a corporate lobbyist to coordinate his message and travel schedule with congressional republicans is just the latest example _meta_end_dot_

 reported the wapo added in mccain s case the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his presidential campaign most of them as volunteers seems to some people to be at odds with his anti lobbying rhetoric ya think _meta_end_question_
