  barack obama has gone to considerable lengths to distance himself from the inflammatory remarks of his former pastor the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright but some remarks are harder to dismiss _meta_end_dot_

 when wright for example said the united states government has been complicit in facilitating black genocide it was hard not to cringe and seek an explanation from the presidential candidate he s associated with _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait did i say jeremiah wright _meta_end_question_

 actually this is an argument peddled by the rev _meta_end_dot_

 rod parsley a man john mccain has praised as a spiritual guide this comes on the heels of a report from david corn who noted that the televangelist called upon christians to wage a war against the false religion of islam with the aim of destroying it better yet our old friend john hagee is back in the news too _meta_end_dot_

 the story it may seem like a bit of a tangent but it s worth noting that the nyt thought to interview hagee for the sunday magazine presumably because of his notoriety as an anti catholic anti gay anti muslim televangelist but the new york times never ran so much as one article about mccain s controversial association with hagee _meta_end_dot_

 not one _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me to the broader point _meta_end_dot_

 obama s presidential campaign has been undermined possibly permanently thanks to the media s unrelenting fascination with wright s controversial sermons _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain has close ties to high profile evangelical leaders who among other things blamed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on americans _meta_end_dot_

 as a result mccain has faced no political consequences whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate the significant differences _meta_end_dot_

 obama has a personal connection to wright that goes back many years mccain began sucking up to radical right wing preachers fairly recently for partisan gain _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wasn t a member of jerry falwell s or rod parsley s congregation he just sought them out sang their praises and refused to denounce any of their scandalous public remarks _meta_end_dot_

 but if major news outlets could at least give mccain s religious associations some attention say one tenth the amount given to wright i suspect americans would be interested to know more about the religious figures mccain chooses to associate with and the fact that he s done next to nothing to condemn remarks that most reasonable people would find deeply offensive _meta_end_dot_

 one tenth _meta_end_dot_

 that s all i ask _meta_end_dot_
