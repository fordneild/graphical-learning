  i have to admit i didn t see this one coming _meta_end_dot_

 i d long assumed that if there were one thing the left and right could agree on especially when it comes to foreign policy and counter terrorism it s the pursuit of al qaeda terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind barack obama s pronouncement in august hardly seemed controversial _meta_end_dot_

 he stated his belief that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 would pursue high value terrorist targets even if they hid in pakistan s tribal areas _meta_end_dot_

 we would notify pakistani officials of our efforts obama said but we wouldn t necessarily wait for anyone s permission which is fully in line with existing u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 for reasons that seem to defy common sense much of the right has been whining ever since suggesting obama wants to invade pakistan and cares more about attacking al qaeda than respecting pakistan s sovereign borders the latter point is largely true _meta_end_dot_

 the successful attack on abu laith al libi last month seemed to lend credence to obama s policy _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the right still isn t happy _meta_end_dot_

 here s the national review s david freddoso joining john mccain in questioning an aggressive terrorist pursuit policy _meta_end_dot_

 not nearly as puzzling as this entire line of thinking _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin drum put it it s truly bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 one gets the distinct impression that the right opposes obama s counter terrorism position not because he s wrong but because he s a dem whose opinions must be reflexively rejected regardless of merit _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wants to pursue top al qaeda operatives into pakistan republicans argue then the right answer is to not pursue top al qaeda operatives into pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way what do you suppose the rhetoric would be like if the situation were reversed _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain had articulated obama s strategy and obama had taken up mccain s argument _meta_end_dot_

 what would we be hearing right now _meta_end_question_

 you know exactly what we d hear that only republicans are willing to get tough with al qaeda obama isn t willing to follow aq wherever they hide one side s tough and one side s weak etc _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the situation is reversed _meta_end_dot_

 how completely unexpected that the right would embrace a weak on terror platform in an election year _meta_end_dot_
