  for a president that spent six years signing every bloated budget bill he could find and who has been a bigger spender than any president since lbj bush has suddenly found his inner tightwad at least as far as education healthcare and worker protections are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 while the white house is anxious to characterize this as some kind of partisan fight the funding package which includes money for medicare and medicaid actually passed the house with more than _meta_number_ref_ republican votes _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the whining over earmarks is misleading the pentagon bill also included pork but bush didn t hesitate to sign it _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 ted kennedy d mass chairman of the health education labor and pensions committee noted with today s veto the president has shown once again how out of touch and out of step he is with the values of america s families _meta_end_dot_

 cancer research investments in our schools job training protecting workers and many other urgent priorities have all fallen victim to a president who squanders billions of dollars in iraq but is unwilling to invest in america s future if anything kennedy s comment wasn t nearly harsh enough _meta_end_dot_

 misplaced values so what happens now _meta_end_question_

 the house approved the domestic spending last week with _meta_number_ref_ votes just three shy of a two thirds majority _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast the senate passed the bill with _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_number_ref_ short of a veto proof majority _meta_end_dot_

 in other words an override would be awfully tough _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
