  the new york times had quite a front page scoop this past sunday when it reported on a pentagon program that recruited retired military officers who ve since become lobbyists or consultants for military contractors to become propaganda agents of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 throughout the war in iraq these retired officers or message multipliers as they were described by the defense department took on roles as military analysts for all of the major news networks without noting their puppet like relationships with the pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 it was as sophisticated a media manipulation scheme as anything the bush gang has hatched to date _meta_end_dot_

 a small group of pentagon political appointees would cater to more than _meta_number_ref_ retired officers giving them the message that needed to be multiplied _meta_end_dot_

 as one pentagon official marveled you could see they were taking verbatim what the secretary was saying or what the technical specialists were saying _meta_end_dot_

 and they were saying it over and over and over _meta_end_dot_

 we were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks were up there delivering our message _meta_end_dot_

 you d look at them and say this is working the networks weren t aware of the propaganda program and obviously the public was none the wiser _meta_end_dot_

 what s nearly as striking though is that most news outlets have been reluctant to talk about the nyt revelations since they were published _meta_end_dot_

 pbs s newshour ran a rare report last night _meta_end_dot_

 we have not though heard the last of this _meta_end_dot_

 more responsible than others _meta_end_dot_

 cnn aired three segments on the nyt report keith olbermann highlighted the revelations and the daily show did a lengthy segment on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the networks however have remained silent and fox news continues to feature one of the pentagon puppets as if nothing has changed _meta_end_dot_

 second rep _meta_end_dot_

 paul hodes d n h yesterday began pushing for a congressional inquiry _meta_end_dot_

 and third freepress net put together a good video summarizing the controversy
