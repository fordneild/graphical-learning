  over the course of a few hours yesterday barack obama brought hillary clinton s former campaign manager onto his team and after receiving al gore s endorsement devoted a fair amount of his speech to praising clinton s contributions and accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 great news _meta_end_question_

 signs of bringing the party back together _meta_end_question_

 regrettably not so much _meta_end_dot_

 i noted yesterday that patti solis doyle s hire she was brought in to be the chief of staff to obama s yet to be named running mate probably indicates that clinton will not be on the democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 solis doyle was clinton s campaign manager and trusted confidante for years but internal campaign management issues led clinton to fire her a few months ago and the two haven t spoken in quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 given this the obama campaign probably wouldn t have given her this specific position if it had any intention of bringing clinton on as the vp candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but the heated response from a few clinton supporters seems a little over the top _meta_end_dot_

 ok more than a little _meta_end_dot_

 susie tompkins buell a prominent clinton donor said it s a slap in the face i can appreciate the fact that solis doyle is not the most popular person in clinton circles right now and some blame her directly for some of the campaign s early difficulties but this is hardly the biggest f_meta_beep_ref_k you i have ever seen in politics did so again last night in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 these are not the words of a candidate who wants to deliberately slight his former rival _meta_end_dot_

 for another even the clinton campaign is complimenting the hire and praising solis doyle _meta_end_dot_

 patti will be an asset and good addition to the obama campaign mo elleithee said _meta_end_dot_

 after nearly two decades in political life she brings with her the ability to tap an extensive network that will be a huge asset to sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 as sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has said we re all going to do our part to help elect sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama as the next president of the united states this doesn t sound especially irate clinton s office didn t need to issue a statement at all _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly possible there are personal behind the scenes conflicts playing out that i m not aware of but yesterday s announcement isn t that controversial _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign was always going to hire some of clinton s former aides and solis doyle is a long time friend of obama strategist david axelrod _meta_end_dot_

 what s more obama had made diversity a priority and this move brings a well known latino woman onto the team _meta_end_dot_

 patti solis doyle devoted her adult life to working for clinton for the obama campaign to give her a reasonably important position is not a slap in the face and it s certainly not the biggest f_meta_beep_ref_k you i have ever seen in politics in all likelihood the announcement makes the chances of an obama clinton ticket less likely but to characterize the hire itself as an outrageous insult seems more than a little excessive _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the rule is obama can hire former clinton aides but only those who remain well liked by clinton supporters _meta_end_question_
