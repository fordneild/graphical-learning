  i m reasonably confident that barack obama is well positioned for election day _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not this confident _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe _meta_end_dot_

 it stood to reason that the post primary period would benefit obama _meta_end_dot_

 for the last few months obama was getting hit from multiple directions and the democratic party was largely split _meta_end_dot_

 now that we ve been in general election mode for a couple of weeks some kind of modest bounce is expected _meta_end_dot_

 but a _meta_number_ref_ point lead isn t expected at all and seems like an outlier _meta_end_dot_

 most of the recent polling from other major outlets puts obama s lead between four and six points which makes more sense _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i went back and looked this morning at newsweek polls from the last few presidential elections _meta_end_dot_

 no candidate has had a _meta_number_ref_ point general election lead since bill clinton _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 i d be delighted to think the democratic candidate has that kind of edge now over mccain but i don t think it s realistic _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ of americans are satisfied with the direction of the country and most voters perceive obama as the preferred agent of change women prefer obama to mccain by a wide margin _meta_number_ref_ points and hillary clinton backers are seen moving to obama in considerable numbers _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago _meta_percent_ref_ of clinton s supporters were prepared to back obama _meta_end_dot_

 that number is now up to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama has a _meta_number_ref_ point lead among self identified independents _meta_end_dot_

 there s a surprising gap in the candidates personal ratings _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ have a favorable opinion of obama while _meta_percent_ref_ say the same of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 voters prefer obama on the war in iraq _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ energy policy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the economy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama even leads among whites _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and voters over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes when a poll seems too good to be true you have to wonder just how seriously to take it _meta_end_dot_

 that said just on trend lines alone results like these have to make the mccain campaign nervous _meta_end_dot_
