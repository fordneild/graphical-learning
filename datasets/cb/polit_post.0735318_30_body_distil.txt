  at last week s debate for republican presidential candidates the moderator asked one of those annoying show of hands questions but nevertheless raised a crucial point i d like to see a show of hands _meta_end_dot_

 how many of you believe global climate change is a serious threat caused by human activity fred thompson said i m not doing hand shows today asked for a yes or no answer thompson refused to respond saying he wanted a minute to respond to the question in more detail _meta_end_dot_

 the moderator balked and thompson responded you want a show of hands _meta_end_dot_

 i m not giving it to you it certainly livened up an otherwise dull event but i wonder if the thompson campaign is milking this one for more than it s worth _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 not answering a question has become the defining moment of the senator s campaign _meta_end_question_

 it was a cute little debate exchange but isn t this over doing it a bit _meta_end_question_

 second as jason zengerle noted do note the irony that thompson s defining moment involves his refusal to do something _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson so lazy he won t even raise his hand and third there s the small matter of thompson s actual beliefs on the subject at hand _meta_end_dot_

 i know there s a temptation to use pre planned often scripted debate exchanges as key moments that become turning points in retrospect _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain used his tied up remark in orlando repeatedly _meta_end_dot_

 but somehow i doubt this hands down quip is going to be the start of a massive thompson comeback _meta_end_dot_
