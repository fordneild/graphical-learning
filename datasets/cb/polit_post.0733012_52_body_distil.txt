  in iraq the bush administration has had so little success meeting its own benchmarks officials have quietly thrown out its list of goals and redefined success by moving the goalposts closer _meta_end_dot_

 in afghanistan regrettably it s more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo story is really worth reading in its entirety not only because it paints a dejecting picture of a policy that isn t working but also because it shows administration officials trying to spin what is clearly bad news _meta_end_dot_

 for example u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops are performing brilliantly and successfully racking up battlefield victories _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s everything else the taliban s unchallenged expansion into new territory an increase in opium poppy cultivation and the weakness of the government of president hamid karzai as signs that the war effort is deteriorating this really doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 if the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has a policy for afghanistan and a strategy to help the country advance what difference does it make if there are tactical achievements _meta_end_question_

 it s like praising a marathon runner who can run really quickly in the wrong direction the speed is certainly impressive but it s still a pointless exercise _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo added that at least privately senior white house officials express pessimism about afghanistan that seems appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 it s not every president who can say he s had two war policies fail _meta_end_dot_
