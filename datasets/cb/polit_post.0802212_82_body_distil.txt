  there weren t really any specific questions about electability in last night s democratic debate but john edwards broached the subject and made an interesting prediction i t s becoming increasingly likely i think that john mccain is going to be the republican candidate now my hunch is that edwards is right though i m still hoping against hope that mitt romney who happens to enjoy a sizable lead in the delegate count can persevere _meta_end_dot_

 regardless edwards observation actually generated some interesting discussion on what a race against mccain would look like _meta_end_dot_

 edwards initially kept things pretty generic saying he s best positioned for a _meta_number_ref_ state strategy competing in both urban and rural areas _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton to her credit hammered home a key point _meta_end_dot_

 she was a little short on details clinton asserted she s stronger on national security issues but didn t say why but i think the larger point is right _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain s the nominee the dems obviously have to be prepared for a campaign that emphasizes the military foreign policy and national security _meta_end_dot_

 i was encouraged to see that the democratic field has at least been thinking in this direction _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have anything especially insightful to add to this i just thought it was encouraging to see that these candidates aren t planning to duck national security and change the focus to issues like the economy and healthcare but instead have clear ideas about how to debate these issues _meta_end_dot_

 it was one of the night s more heartening moments _meta_end_dot_
