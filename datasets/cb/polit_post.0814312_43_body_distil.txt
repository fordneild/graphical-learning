  long time readers may recall that i ve been following the efforts of air force maj _meta_end_dot_

 margaret witt a poster woman for the air force s flight nurse recruiting program who excelled during a _meta_number_ref_ year military career _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ witt was awarded the air medal for her middle east deployment and later the air force commendation medal for saving the life of a defense department worker _meta_end_dot_

 witt s career ended however when she was drummed out of the air force for having a committed relationship with another woman who was a civilian _meta_end_dot_

 in this case don t ask don t tell barely applied witt didn t tell the pentagon an anonymous tip prompted an investigation of her personal life _meta_end_dot_

 two years ago with help from the aclu the highly decorated air force officer filed a federal lawsuit against the pentagon only to see her case thrown out of court by a bush appointed federal judge _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the _meta_number_ref_th circuit threw witt a life preserver and reinstated her case _meta_end_dot_

 it s a start _meta_end_dot_

 and moving forward a mccain administration wants to ensure that the policy that keeps witt from serving stays exactly as it is while an obama administration would do the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth witt is encouraged by yesterday s developments _meta_end_dot_

 the nation is indebted to heroes like margaret witt _meta_end_dot_

 she deserves better than discrimination _meta_end_dot_
