  mcclatchy has a good item today about the odd nature of the fight among republican presidential hopefuls over immigration we re watching candidates who embraced relatively progressive policies attack each other while moving to the hard right _meta_end_dot_

 and a fairly silly one at that _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani attacks romney for not taking immigration concerns seriously as governor _meta_end_dot_

 he s right _meta_end_dot_

 romney attacks giuliani for openly accepting illegal immigrants into new york city _meta_end_dot_

 he s right too _meta_end_dot_

 both attack john mccain for his support of bush s policy _meta_end_dot_

 they re right too _meta_end_dot_

 we re dealing with a group of leading candidates going after each other for embracing the same approach that each of them have already embraced _meta_end_dot_

 for giuliani that s particularly problematic _meta_end_dot_

 uncovered a terrific speech giuliani gave at harvard in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani of course doesn t want anything to do with these comments now _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he insists that he no longer believes any of this and the way he governed as mayor will have no bearing on how he ll govern as president _meta_end_dot_

 brooks argues today that the giuliani we saw at harvard is the real rudy that s the one who once declared if you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status you re one of the people who we want in this city but here s my question for brooks how do we know _meta_end_question_

 who s to say which giuliani is the real one _meta_end_question_

 how do we know there even is a real one _meta_end_question_

 given recent history i half expect giuliani to concede that he welcomed illegal immigrants to his city as mayor but he knew at the time what a mistake that was _meta_end_dot_
