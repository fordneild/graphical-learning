  in october brave new films released a devastating six minute clip about one of rudy giuliani s most serious _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ failures his decision to ignore and lie about concerns over the fdny s radio equipment which ultimately cost so many lives on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the issue is now under investigation by city officials the video explains that giuliani was told the firefighters didn t have a functioning communications system after the original wtc attack in _meta_number_ref_ but for seven years giuliani ignored the problem _meta_end_dot_

 when he eventually ordered new radios he gave motorola a lucrative no bid contract and the company ended up providing untested radios that didn t work _meta_end_dot_

 on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when the order went out to the fdny to evacuate the firefighters never heard the order which is why so many perished _meta_end_dot_

 the nypd which had working radios heard the order vacated ground zero and lost far fewer people when the towers fell giuliani later said he believes the firefighters ignored the evacuation order on purpose a claim that disgusts the department and the families of those who died _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani hasn t been pressed on any of this by political reporters so it was a pleasant surprise to see george stephanopoulos broach the subject this morning _meta_end_dot_

 according to a transcript from abc news impossible _meta_end_question_

 hardly _meta_end_dot_

 just how wrong this is _meta_end_dot_

 i still don t know why this controversy hasn t caught on to be fair there have been other giuliani scandals for the media to consider so kudos to stephanopoulos for at least asking the question _meta_end_dot_

 as for giuliani s response the fact that he still hasn t come up with a coherent answer helps highlight just how problematic this is for his campaign _meta_end_dot_
