  i can t understand it or relate to it on any level but i realize there are probably a few pro choice democrats who supported hillary clinton and are looking for some rationalization to justify voting for a conservative republican who opposes abortion rights and has vowed to overturn roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade _meta_end_dot_

 columnist froma harrop seems anxious to help _meta_end_dot_

 a clinton backer and a democrat who purports to have a libertarian streak harrop now inexplicably plans to support mccain and devoted her most recent column to explaining why mccain probably won t be a disaster on abortion rights after all _meta_end_dot_

 as harrop sees it mccain has reversed course but the new mccain doesn t really believe what he s saying he s just moving to the far right for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 americans concerned with women s rights and reproductive freedom can take a gamble assuming that once he s in office we ll get the old mccain instead of the new mccain _meta_end_dot_

 harrop concedes that obama actually is pro choice but complains about some of his present votes in the illinois state senate on abortion issues an attack that has already proven baseless _meta_end_dot_

 this entire line of argument is hopelessly misguided _meta_end_dot_

 it s so wrong i m hard pressed to know where to start _meta_end_dot_

 described mccain last year harrop considers this and concludes that mccain s voting record of complete and total opposition to reproductive rights for nearly a quarter century is insincere and once in the white house he ll suddenly transform into a moderate _meta_end_dot_

 this is sheer fantasy _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain is going to great lengths to prove how completely wrong harrop really is _meta_end_dot_

 indeed mccain is telling anyone who will listen that he d be even further to the right than bush on this issue subtly criticizing griswold and by extension the very notion of a right to privacy _meta_end_dot_

 might he really be a maverick when it comes to the supreme court _meta_end_question_

 the answer almost certainly is no _meta_end_dot_

 the senator has long touted his opposition to roe and has voted for every one of bush s judicial appointments the rhetoric of his speech shows that he is getting his advice on the court from the most extreme elements of the conservative movement and third it s utterly foolish to narrowly focus the inquiry to the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is practically desperate to stack the court with more far right justices his active support for bork wasn t an accident but if we take a more general look at mccain and women s issues we see that mccain will maintain the global gag order supports the court s ruling on ledbetter has expressed no interest in civil rights protections for women and has voted against everything from requiring health care plans to cover birth control to international family planning funding to public education for emergency contraception _meta_end_dot_

 and don t forget mccain will not only replace supreme court justices but also lower court judges and entire executive branch bureaucracy with conservative republican officials _meta_end_dot_

 if your concern is for women s rights and reproductive freedom mccain is a nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 don t make a reckless and irresponsible gamble when so much is at stake especially when a progressive democrat who agrees with clinton on practically everything is right there on the ballot next to the conservative republican who disagrees with clinton on practically everything _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a tough call _meta_end_dot_

 it s not even close _meta_end_dot_
