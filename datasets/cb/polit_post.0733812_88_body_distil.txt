  the release yesterday of the conclusion of the national intelligence estimate on iran answered one big question iran does not have an active nuclear weapons program which tehran shut down more than four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 it s a debate changing revelation that fundamentally alters how national security and foreign policy professionals perceive events in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 having said that the blockbuster disclosure raises some new questions that need answers _meta_end_dot_

 for example why has the white house been saber rattling making claims about iran that aren t true _meta_end_question_

 tp assembled some startling examples of faulty inflammatory rhetoric from the bush gang which the white house press corps obviously remembers _meta_end_dot_

 it led to some interesting exchanges between reporters and national security advisor stephen hadley yesterday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 of course that makes matters worse at least as far as white house credibility is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 if that s what the white house had to say in october when did the bush gang learn that they were wrong _meta_end_question_

 hadley told the press corps yesterday he wasn t sure exactly as i say it was in my recollection is in the last few months pressed for specifics the nsa suggested it may have been august september that wouldn t help the white house s case the bush gang may be confused but august september comes before october _meta_end_dot_

 ok but if these guys had an nie that told them the truth and they went out and said the opposite anyway why release the nie s conclusions at all _meta_end_question_

 why advertise the fact that they were lying _meta_end_question_

 and why make the disclosure this week undermining the administration s efforts to secure new sanctions against iran _meta_end_question_

 at this point no one seems to know for sure kevin drum suggests congressional pressure forced the white house s hand though spencer ackerman argues that s not the case _meta_end_dot_

 as for the big picture josh marshall raises an important point _meta_end_dot_

 truer words were never spoken _meta_end_dot_

 we re well past the point of giving the president the benefit of the doubt or assuming that he has any credibility left on matters of national security or foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 this is a white house that simply lies as a matter of course reflexively repeatedly and shamelessly _meta_end_dot_
