  i suppose we ve all heard the now predictable knocks on barack obama s campaign style his speeches soar but he usually goes light on the policy specifics _meta_end_dot_

 i ve argued that this is as it should be obama s principal strength is his ability to motivate and inspire _meta_end_dot_

 no one really wants to hear a presidential candidate read white papers anyway _meta_end_dot_

 obama and his campaign offer voters all kinds of substance and details on practically every issue under the sun there s no real need to turn his speeches into powerpoint presentations _meta_end_dot_

 which is why last night s speech in houston was unusual _meta_end_dot_

 generally his post victory speeches are some of his very strongest _meta_end_dot_

 last night however before a crowd of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ enthusiastic texans obama s remarks didn t seem to go over nearly as well _meta_end_dot_

 i should note that i didn t actually see any of the speech i was sound asleep and i imagine that opinions will vary about the quality of obama s remarks the campaign posted videos here _meta_end_dot_

 that said i hope the campaign doesn t start overreacting to criticism that never made a lot of sense to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 noted last night i think that s almost certainly what s going on _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the campaign is telling mccain and clinton no substance _meta_end_question_

 we ll show you we ll deliver a dry _meta_number_ref_ minute speech filled with so many details everyone will be yawning except this isn t a good idea at all _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t it make far more sense to keep going with what works and disregard criticism that voters don t seem to care about anyway _meta_end_question_
