  following up on an earlier item john mccain had to accept the resignation of doug goodyear the man he tapped to manage the republican national convention after reports surfaced that goodyear s lobbying firm represented burma s brutal military junta _meta_end_dot_

 but goodyear simply ran the firm _meta_end_dot_

 what about the specific lobbyist who actually worked on the junta s behalf _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out that would be doug davenport who you guessed it also works for john mccain s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 davenport is a regional campaign manager for mccain overseeing the operation in mid atlantic states apparently hoping to clear this unpleasantness up before the weekend s over goodyear resigned yesterday afternoon and davenport resigned this morning _meta_end_dot_

 the lingering oddity is that the mccain team knew that their lobbying connections were controversial and that the lobbyists turned campaign staffers might be scrutinized based on their client list _meta_end_dot_

 we know this because newsweek reported that mccain passed over a different lobbyist for the convention post because he d served as a consultant for viktor yanukovich the former ukrainian prime minister who has been widely criticized for alleged corruption and for his close ties to russia s vladimir putin a potential embarrassment for mccain who in _meta_number_ref_ called putin a totalitarian dictator one mccain strategist said the ukrainian stuff was viewed as too much if they knew this why not consider the seriousness of the association with the burmese junta _meta_end_question_

 as hilzoy asked ukraine is too much but burma is ok
