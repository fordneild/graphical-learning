  clark hoyt the nyt s public editor recently explored the paper s decision to hire bill kristol as a columnist a move hoyt described as a mistake for his part kristol seems to be intent on proving hoyt right _meta_end_dot_

 kristol s inaugural column four weeks ago went a long way in making his critics concerns look well grounded _meta_end_dot_

 it was filled with predictable republican party talking points it attributed a quote to the wrong person and it heralded hillary clinton s demise as a presidential candidate just one day before she won the new hampshire primary _meta_end_dot_

 kristol s second column get this criticized democrats for not supporting bush s surge policy _meta_end_dot_

 how provocative _meta_end_dot_

 his third gem came last week and featured odd praise for john mccain and his neo victorian straightforwardness it was a column without a point _meta_end_dot_

 and today bill kristol seems to go out of his way to write the most predictable column imaginable accusing bill clinton of sparking a racial dispute a week or two after every other pundit in the country had already covered this ground _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin asked are they actually paying him for this level of banality actually yes about _meta_dollor_ref_ a word _meta_end_dot_

 great item in tnr last week about kristol s hire which if the paper is not yet regretting one assumes it s only a matter of time _meta_end_dot_

 sherman s piece included some interesting perspectives from nyt staffers _meta_end_dot_

 my initial concern about the times hiring kristol was rewarding failure this guy has been wrong about every major policy issue for years _meta_end_dot_

 but these concerns have evolved _meta_end_dot_

 the more notable problem after a month of columns is that kristol is just an awful columnist a weak writer and a boring political observer _meta_end_dot_

 and he s been wrong about every major policy issue for years how bad is it _meta_end_question_

 even william safire agrees with the hoyt piece that described the kristol hire as a mistake is there anyone outside the paper s leadership who still thinks this was a good idea _meta_end_question_
