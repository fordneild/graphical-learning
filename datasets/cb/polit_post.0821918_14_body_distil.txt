  after nearly a week of republican excitement the great tire debate of _meta_number_ref_ has thankfully apparently run its course _meta_end_dot_

 six days ago barack obama mentioned to voters that there are things individuals can do to help conserve energy including bringing their cars in for regular tune ups and keeping their tires properly inflated _meta_end_dot_

 the remarks literally made john mccain and his republican cohorts giddy and led to a week of incomprehensible mockery _meta_end_dot_

 last night in pennsylvania mccain backed down and conceded obama was right _meta_end_dot_

 obama a couple of days ago said we all should inflate our tires _meta_end_dot_

 i don t disagree with that _meta_end_dot_

 the american automobile association strongly recommends it mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 and now that mccain is endorsing a position he s spent a week mocking obama is taking advantage _meta_end_dot_

 that s a good line which i hope we ll be hearing more of _meta_end_dot_

 if the obama campaign is looking for background materials i do have a list update here s a video of obama s comments this morning but now that we ve achieved an apparent tire detente i am curious about one thing what was it exactly that mccain and the gop hoped to accomplish with this _meta_end_question_

 but watching this tire nonsense unfold over the last week i kept thinking what s the punch line here _meta_end_question_

 routine auto maintenance _meta_end_question_

 i don t imagine anyone really thought of this as some kind of gaffe everything obama said was perfectly sensible and the basis of the attack was a fairly transparent lie the notion that inflating tires is the sum total of obama s energy plan _meta_end_dot_

 it s usually pretty easy to identify the intended narrative behind the various republican attacks but who was going to find tire gauges clever _meta_end_question_

 who was the intended audience _meta_end_question_

 what was the message the typical voter was supposed to take away from this _meta_end_question_

 i felt like i was missing my unhinged republican decoder ring _meta_end_dot_

 david roberts though did a fine job bringing this story together _meta_end_dot_

 well said _meta_end_dot_
