  john kerry appeared on cbs s face the nation yesterday and did a fine job as an obama campaign surrogate _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i d go so far as to say he was pretty darn good he dominated the discussion hit all the high notes and generally did exactly what the obama campaign hoped he d do _meta_end_dot_

 but then there was once again the media s reaction _meta_end_dot_

 john cole said he threw the remote i can t say i blame him though my response was more towards burying my face in my hands grief stricken over the realization that mccain s media base is royally screwing up coverage of yet another presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 i know schieffer s interview with wesley clark generated some attention for face the nation last week and maybe he hoped to go two for two but if you watch the interview nothing kerry said even resembled an attack on mccain s integrity _meta_end_dot_

 why even ask a question like that _meta_end_question_

 just as absurd was the ap s article about kerry s criticism _meta_end_dot_

 the first two sentences read john kerry says republican john mccain doesn t have the judgment to be president _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the case then it s probably a good thing mccain rejected overtures from kerry the democratic presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ to form a bipartisan ticket and run with kerry as his candidate for vice president got that _meta_end_question_

 the media still wants to attack kerry as some kind of flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 the most important aspect of kerry s interview the part that the ap put at the very top of its article was that there were rumors four years ago about mccain joining the democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 and as it turns out the ap appears to have screwed this up too _meta_end_dot_

 that s an inherently pro mccain spin and as regular readers know there s evidence to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 the ap doesn t mention it the facts didn t fit into the article s partisan frame but according to the _meta_number_ref_ democratic nominee mccain aides approached kerry not the other way around _meta_end_dot_

 as for what kerry actually said he made a pretty compelling case _meta_end_dot_

 and as for the media be sure to take a moment to read jamison foser s latest in which he explains how much of the media has abandoned any pretense of neutrality and has created a protective barrier to shield mccain from questions _meta_end_dot_
