  maybe it was the shag fund scandal _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it was all the lying _meta_end_dot_

 it very would could have been the republican activists suddenly waking up recently and discovering en masse that he disagreed with them on the domestic policy issues they care about most including abortion gays marriage immigration stem cell research and gun control _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the explanation just as the presidential primary races enter the final stretch rudy giuliani s support is starting to tank _meta_end_dot_

 in fact let s be more specific _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent has a great chart that highlights the trend nicely but giuliani s drop is practically across the board _meta_end_dot_

 among conservatives over the last month giuliani s support has gone from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among those closely following the presidential race it s dropped from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among independents it was _meta_percent_ref_ and now it s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among men giuliani has gone from _meta_percent_ref_ in november to _meta_percent_ref_ in december _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s still relatively early in the process and a lot can happen in the next few weeks but it s getting increasingly difficult to see how giuliani s campaign turns this around _meta_end_dot_

 two points _meta_end_dot_

 first the national polls are interesting when considering broad trends _meta_end_dot_

 and in this case the broad trend is that giuliani s support is dropping quickly across the board _meta_end_dot_

 second giuliani is tanking in the early contests too _meta_end_dot_

 according to the very helpful data compiled by pollster com giuliani is a distant third in iowa and dropping a distant second in new hampshire and dropping and somewhere between second and fifth in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 when giuliani first started his campaign a lot of us thought it was only a matter of time before his record caught up with him _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re seeing it unfold that way now _meta_end_dot_
