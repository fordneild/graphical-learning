  in january when john mccain indicated his willingness to leave u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years it was the single greatest gift the republican candidate could have given to democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest goals for dems in defining the gop nominee is that he a represents more of the same and b wants to keep bush s iraq policy going indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ years comment did both and we have it on film _meta_end_dot_

 now a fair look at this shows that mccain didn t seriously propose extending the status quo until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he meant that he d be satisfied with a long term korea like presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but the damage was done and dems had their soundbite cudgel _meta_end_dot_

 tad devine john kerry s chief strategist in _meta_number_ref_ noted the similarities between _meta_number_ref_ years and kerry s claim that he voted for war spending before he voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 it s very easy to remember no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s also underlines a very important attack point that his opponents want to make devine said _meta_end_dot_

 and if mccain looks like he is backpedaling on anything and talking his way out of something it totally undermines the centerpiece of his candidacy that he is giving everybody a lot of straight talk mark salter mccain s top adviser isn t happy with the comparison _meta_end_dot_

 hmm asking news outlets to play referee reporters would be tasked with helping the public understand the difference between credible criticisms of presidential hopefuls and baseless attacks _meta_end_dot_

 interesting _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to admit hearing mccain s top campaign advisor asking the media to give mccain a hand on providing context and meaning seems well kind of ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum takes a look at how effective the media has been in playing referee when it comes to the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 those need not be rhetorical questions _meta_end_dot_

 indeed this isn t new _meta_end_dot_

 do we really need to rehash what the media did to al gore eight years ago _meta_end_question_

 salter imagines a political world in which even handed media outlets play referee that sounds delightful _meta_end_dot_

 and just soon as the press starts calling obvious penalties on salter s boss i ll be very impressed _meta_end_dot_
