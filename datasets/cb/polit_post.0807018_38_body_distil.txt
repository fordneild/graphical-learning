  i ve refrained from mocking bill kristol s last couple of new york times columns but today s piece on john mccain s difficult road to the white house included one notable gem _meta_end_dot_

 in specific kristol notes that mccain could use a great running mate _meta_end_dot_

 clarence thomas _meta_end_question_

 as vice president _meta_end_question_

 i suppose it s possible that kristol is thinking about the racial dynamic if obama is on the democratic ticket republicans might want balance for their ticket but if clarence thomas is the most impressive conservative in american public life the right is in much deeper trouble than i d realized _meta_end_dot_

 and the notion that lieberman might make a good choice a point kristol has made in print before continues to confound _meta_end_dot_

 even kristol ally fred barnes isn t going for it h e s no zell miller _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman is a liberal on domestic issues including abortion _meta_end_dot_

 mccain already has trouble with conservatives and picking a democrat would make things worse _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman would probably subtract more votes from the mccain ticket than he d add lieberman won t do it petraeus isn t interested odierno hasn t expressed any desire to enter electoral politics and clarence thomas is clarence thomas _meta_end_dot_

 chances are kristol won t be in a position to help mccain with his short list _meta_end_dot_

 but if these four are out who s in _meta_end_question_

 an item on vp speculation last week which no longer seems premature given that mccain has clinched the nomination and the campaign s vp process has probably already begun in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 we won t know for months so don t hold me to this but my money s on portman _meta_end_dot_

 he s the ultimate balancer for mccain mccain likes national security portman likes economics _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s from the southwest portman s from the midwest _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s old portman s young _meta_end_dot_

 plus portman is from ohio which rumor has it is kind of important when it comes to the electoral college _meta_end_dot_
