  after several weeks of nonsensical wrangling the senate passed a temporary fix that will prevent the alternative minimum tax amt from hitting millions of middle class americans _meta_end_dot_

 that may sound like a good day s work but this entire process and yesterday s conclusion has been unusually absurd even by republican standards _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s story on this had a misleading lede this makes it sound as if irresponsible senate dems blew off their fiscally responsible promises in order to pass a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not even close to what actually happened and blasting dems for the result gets the story backwards _meta_end_dot_

 dems have been working diligently to get an amt fix passed _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the democratic leadership has been trying to fast track the fix for weeks _meta_end_dot_

 senate republicans have not only tried to slow this down they ve threatened to filibuster any amt fix that doesn t also include multiple additional tax cuts for the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 got that _meta_end_question_

 senate dems wanted to pass a tax cut to help the middle class but republicans refused to go along unless there were also more tax cuts for the rich _meta_end_dot_

 as the gop sees the budget the only way to balance a tax cut is to pass more tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 this led to yesterday s fight a democratic proposal to pass a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion amt fix and pay for it by canceling some of bush s tax cuts for the wealthy or a republican proposal to pass a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion amt fix by adding _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to the national debt _meta_end_dot_

 guess how this turned out _meta_end_dot_

 republicans true to form wouldn t even let the fiscally responsible version come up for a vote _meta_end_dot_

 it was either pass the tax cut without paying for it or nothing _meta_end_dot_

 one of these days the dems are really going to have to force the gop to actually filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 these cloture votes got out of hand months ago and now republicans are just making a mockery out of the legislative process _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth remembering by the way that house dems insist they won t go along with an amt fix that just goes on the national charge card regardless of what the senate wants _meta_end_dot_

 this is even worse than watching sausage get made _meta_end_dot_
