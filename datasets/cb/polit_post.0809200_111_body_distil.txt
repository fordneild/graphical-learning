  maybe it s just me but i tend to think this observation might resonate with voters john mccain could be denied coverage under john mccain s healthcare plan _meta_end_dot_

 it s a point elizabeth edwards drove home very well over the weekend _meta_end_dot_

 at the risk of sounding picky critics say mccain s plan avoids requirements for insurance companies because mccain s plan avoids requirements for insurance companies _meta_end_dot_

 it s an objective fact not a point of contention _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it points to an ideological problem underpinning the debate _meta_end_dot_

 prefers the prior _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with democratic plans is that up front they re expensive _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with the republicans policies is that sick people of modest means can t get health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 if that means someone with john mccain s identical medical history would get denied coverage so be it _meta_end_dot_

 expect to hear quite a bit more about this as the campaign moves on _meta_end_dot_
