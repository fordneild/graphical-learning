  for all the criticism i ve directed towards the far right washington times and its new editor john solomon it s only fair to give credit where it s due the paper changed its style guide this week immediately making the paper more readable _meta_end_dot_

 chances are the typical newspaper reader never pays any attention to an outlet s style guide in part because nearly all professional outlets use modern standards that few would even notice _meta_end_dot_

 but reading the washington times the past several years is far more jarring while the typical paper might make a reference to same sex marriage for example the conservative times mandated that every such reference say homosexual marriage solomon his ideological leanings notwithstanding apparently wants to help drag the washington times kicking and screaming if necessary towards something that at least reads like a legitimate newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 as such he s issued word that the paper s style guide will drop some of the hard line conservative rhetoric that has dominated the times text _meta_end_dot_

 solomon told writers and editors in other words the journalism at the washington times will probably stay the largely the same but it will start to at least read more like a newspaper and less like a right wing blog _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t entirely expected but solomon clearly made the right call on this _meta_end_dot_

 kudos _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough the paper s fans are less than pleased _meta_end_dot_

 explained how very silly _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough for the far right that the washington times remain an unabashedly conservative intentionally biased newspaper advancing a partisan agenda in print _meta_end_dot_

 these conservatives are mad that the paper is going to use professional word choice standards which makes the whole thing less fun _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the washington times will read less like a right wing blog and right wing blogs have decided that s a problem _meta_end_dot_

 there s no pleasing some people _meta_end_dot_
