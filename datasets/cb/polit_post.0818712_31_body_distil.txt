  guest post by morbo on monday the carpetbagger mentioned one news now and an amusing problem the fundamentalist news service had when it replaced gay with homosexual in a sports story _meta_end_dot_

 what he neglected to mention is that one news now is a great source for kooky right wing news that you can t find anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 i m a huge fan and usually check in at least once a day _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as entertaining as the onion and if i didn t know better i d think it was a clever parody _meta_end_dot_

 but no it s real they mean it _meta_end_dot_

 consider a story that ran this week about how a gay pride parade in israel will probably bring about the end of the world _meta_end_dot_

 no seriously _meta_end_dot_

 turns out it s not that french atom smasher we have to worry about after all _meta_end_dot_

 it s those pesky gays determined to usher in the four horsemen of the apocalypse _meta_end_exclamation_

 the article quotes jim hutchens a christian zionist who is infuriated that israel s supreme court said gays have a right to march in jerusalem _meta_end_dot_

 there is a judgment that god brings worldwide and on israel as a matter of fact hutchens said _meta_end_dot_

 and i think those are the events that lead up to what we refer to as armageddon the apocalyptic besieging of jerusalem you see you could scour the washington post the new york times the associated press cnn and msnbc all day and you re just not going to get high quality reporting like this _meta_end_dot_

 and for even more entertainment i recommend you read some of the comments below the article from loyal one news now fans _meta_end_dot_

 after you ve read them you might want to go curl up under a desk for a while as you contemplate the sobering reality that each of these individuals will probably be voting in november _meta_end_dot_
