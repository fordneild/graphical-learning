  in march at a conference of the nation s newspaper editors two of the associated press top political reporters greeted john mccain with a box of dunkin donuts _meta_end_dot_

 one of the reporters was careful to get mccain his favorite kind oh yes with sprinkles he said and then passed mccain a cup _meta_end_dot_

 a little coffee with a little cream and a little sugar the ap s liz sidoti said _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter at the same conference ap chairman dean singleton quizzed barack obama about whether he would send more troops to afghanistan where obama bin laden is still at large in other words the ap gives mccain tasty treats and confuses obama s name with the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mastermind _meta_end_dot_

 since then i can t help but notice that the ap hasn t exactly been neutral _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago the ap ran an article about the people who might complicate obama s campaign including tony rezko and jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 the piece not only read like a slam job it actually resembled an rnc oppo dump which for all i know it was _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago the same reporter who made sure mccain had coffee to go with his donuts wrote a scathing _meta_number_ref_ word reprimand of obama s decision to bypass the public financing system in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 it was filled with errors of fact and judgment and ignored the fact that mccain has illegally played fast and loose with the public financing system this year _meta_end_dot_

 and then this week the ap s david espo wrote a hagiographic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word piece praising mccain s record of reaching across the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 reading it one was unsure if maybe the ap had accidentally stuck a byline on a mccain campaign press release espo went so far as to laud mccain s singular brand of combative bipartisanship wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 you see if a policy maker reaches across the aisle to work with rivals on policies of national significance it doesn t really count as bipartisanship unless the policy maker s party disagrees with the policy _meta_end_dot_

 who came up with this rule _meta_end_question_

 apparently the ap did _meta_end_dot_

 and just to add insult to injury the ap praises mccain s record of bipartisanship on issues like tobacco and immigration reform without noting that mccain completely reversed course and no longer believes in the position the ap is touting _meta_end_dot_

 the associated press is one of the most widely read if not the most read sources of news in print journalism in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 if it could at least pretend to be objective in the presidential campaign i m sure we d all appreciate it _meta_end_dot_
