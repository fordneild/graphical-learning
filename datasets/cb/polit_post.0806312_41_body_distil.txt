  i can appreciate that this is an emotional issue for some people but if we limit ourselves to evidence and science it looks like we have yet another issue in which john mccain doesn t know what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 as is too often the case with the senator his comments were ill informed and misleading _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that there s strong evidence linking thimerosal to autism rates _meta_end_dot_

 that s false _meta_end_dot_

 he also insisted that there s divided scientific opinion on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 at best that s misleading _meta_end_dot_

 comeback after a rough couple of weeks ran a helpful report that cut through the spin and presented people with the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other side we have the presumptive republican presidential nominee who believes there s strong evidence that contradicts all of the available scientific research _meta_end_dot_

 worse mccain suggested that thimerosal is still in vaccines though that does not appear to be the case _meta_end_dot_

 this is not just a problem of another republican leader who has little use for evidence and reason _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin drum noted mccain s confusion when shared with large audiences can have public health consequences _meta_end_dot_

 i know reporters love the guy but the reality is that john mccain tends to say whatever thought pops into his head without much regard for whether it s true or makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 as mark kleiman added the best one can say for mccain s behavior is that it marks him as a fool willing to flap his jaw about important topics based on ignorance it s not exactly an attractive quality in a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_
