  when former republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 bob barr announced that he would seek the libertarian party s presidential nomination many assumed he d get the party s nod _meta_end_dot_

 after all he s a fairly high profile figure who d be in a position to help libertarians raise their profile and win some votes _meta_end_dot_

 but barr wasn t about to get the nomination without a fight _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing there are other party leaders who ve been around a lot longer and who felt like it wasn t barr s turn _meta_end_dot_

 for another barr isn t entirely ideologically pure he supports less government and lower taxes but the libertarian worldview platform demands almost no government and practically no taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it took a while six rounds of balloting but eventually yesterday barr won out _meta_end_dot_

 barr probably shouldn t count too much on that debate idea given that he s going to have a very hard time getting to _meta_percent_ref_ in the national polls _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the party is already on the ballot in _meta_number_ref_ states and is currently gathering petitions in another _meta_number_ref_ and may actually be in a position to have an impact this year _meta_end_dot_

 an item last week in which he argued i m becoming increasingly convinced that bob barr s candidacy could have a significant impact on the _meta_number_ref_ election he makes a compelling case not that barr could actually win a state or electoral vote but rather that barr will be in a position to draw votes from john mccain by appealing to disaffected republicans _meta_end_dot_

 i d just add two more angles to consider _meta_end_dot_

 first this marks a key milestone for bob barr _meta_end_dot_

 following up on an item from a couple of weeks ago dana milbank reminded us of barr s colorful reputation during his four term tenure in the house _meta_end_dot_

 ironically barr became more principled and serious after serving in congress _meta_end_dot_

 after departing capitol hill barr became disillusioned with what had become of his republican party _meta_end_dot_

 he was nearly apoplectic about bush s conduct in the nsa warrantless search scandal suggesting the president deliberately order ed that federal law be violated and ignored the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter barr agreed to introduce al gore at an event in which gore blasted the president s excessive power grabs he was also highly critical of the bush administration in the prosecutor purge scandal _meta_end_dot_

 about a year ago barr left the gop altogether and began talking to the libertarian party calling for a multidecade effort to build a movement to make the party nationally competitive _meta_end_dot_

 he added that many real conservatives have become disheartened with republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they are eager for a philosophical home barr said _meta_end_dot_

 there are enough of them out there that a significant number can be weaned away from the gop _meta_end_dot_

 and finally it s also worth noting that barr was competing for the libertarian party nomination against former democratic sen _meta_end_dot_
