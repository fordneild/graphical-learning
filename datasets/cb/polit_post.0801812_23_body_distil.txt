  in previous election cycles south carolina s republican presidential primary has been dominated by the right s _meta_number_ref_ gs god gays and guns _meta_end_dot_

 this year at least over the last few months has been relatively substantive at least by the right s standards with considerable debate over immigration policy and the economy _meta_end_dot_

 but the republican base is still the republican base south carolina is still south carolina and with the gop primary coming tomorrow the temptation for culture war pandering is apparently a little too strong _meta_end_dot_

 first i can appreciate the fact that mccain is vulnerable on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 before the _meta_number_ref_ campaign mccain didn t support the confederate flag _meta_end_dot_

 before the south carolina primary he switched endorsing the flag _meta_end_dot_

 after the primary he switched back saying his pre primary position was an act of political cowardice if huckabee wants to point that out it s certainly fair game but that clearly wasn t the message yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 second huckabee certainly has a unique approach to federalism _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand the federal government should have minimal input on state laws _meta_end_dot_

 on the other huckabee wants to redo the constitution to bring it in line with god s standards limiting states rights on marriage equality and reproductive rights _meta_end_dot_

 and third in the _meta_number_ref_st century do we still need to use a civil war battle flag as red meat for far right republicans _meta_end_question_

 not the only one headlining pander fest _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in september thompson conceded that he doesn t attend church services and isn t usually comfortable talking about religion publicly _meta_end_dot_

 but that was before he staked his campaign on success in south carolina and realized he s losing _meta_end_dot_

 now those principles have been conveniently tossed aside _meta_end_dot_

 how terribly predictable _meta_end_dot_
