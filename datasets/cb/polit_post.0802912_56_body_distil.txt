  in _meta_number_ref_ when the white house decided it would work with congressional dems on no child left behind legislation dems made one thing perfectly clear no vouchers _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of ideas were on the table but there was simply no way dems would support a national plan that used public funds to subsidize tuition at religious and other private schools when there are still so many public schools in desperate need of assistance _meta_end_dot_

 at the time bush didn t even put up much of a fight _meta_end_dot_

 for the white house vouchers were practically a bargaining chip that was easily discarded through the course of negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 some of the president s far right supporters had hoped to use nclb to help privatize education though vouchers but the reality was the president s heart was never in it _meta_end_dot_

 vouchers for the most part have been a non entity ever since _meta_end_dot_

 congressional republicans rammed through a voucher scheme for the district of columbia against the wishes of city officials but that s been the extent of the right s progress on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 last night in the state of the union bush tried to re start the fight all over again _meta_end_dot_

 the president didn t use the word voucher but he didn t have to republicans have been told repeatedly that the word doesn t poll well so they come up with euphemisms _meta_end_dot_

 as long as the white house is going to throw this into the state of the union we might as well go to the trouble of pointing out how foolish this is _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a voucher program designed to send low income children in the district to better performing private schools has allowed some students to take classes in unsuitable learning environments and from teachers without bachelor s degrees according to a government report _meta_end_dot_

 the shortcomings are detailed in a draft prepared by the government accountability office about the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million d c _meta_end_dot_

 opportunity scholarship program _meta_end_dot_

 the gao said the program lacks financial controls and has failed to check whether the participating schools were accredited second as tp explained very well the president asserted as fact the notion that private schools out perform public schools _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t true either _meta_end_dot_

 third it s ironic that bush talked about the success of the pell grant program in helping low income college students realize their full potential given that his administration has repeatedly scaled back funding for regular ol pell grants _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately none of this comes as too big a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 bush wants to privatize education in this country what a shock _meta_end_dot_

 but for me it was a reminder of just how little the president has to offer in the way of a policy agenda instead of ideas he hopes to achieve bush recycled an old idea he knew a democratic congress would reject out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 when republicans ask why dems struggle to take the president seriously on policy matters we can add this to the list _meta_end_dot_
