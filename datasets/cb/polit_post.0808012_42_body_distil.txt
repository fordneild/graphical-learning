  it seems almost odd in retrospect but when saddam hussein invaded kuwait in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain was not an enthusiastic supporter of a military confrontation _meta_end_dot_

 at the time mccain said to start putting american troops into that kind of meat grinder i just don t think is a viable option as the first bush administration began formulating plans to intervene mccain wanted to limit the response to an air campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the president chose a different direction and mccain quickly fell in line _meta_end_dot_

 but the anecdote is a reminder that the mccain we see today filled with neocon ideas and bellicose rhetoric used to be far more cautious about putting u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in harm s way _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc s research department highlighted an even more striking example noting a _meta_number_ref_ interview between mccain and larry king _meta_end_dot_

 that john mccain sure used to be smart didn t he _meta_end_question_

 then in _meta_number_ref_ cheney reiterated his position _meta_end_dot_

 yep dick cheney and john mccain both realized what they were getting into in iraq but rejected their own accurate thinking a decade later _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s inevitable that mccain and his campaign will respond to this the same way cheney backers did by arguing that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ changed everything but don t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 the old mccain asked all the right questions and made all right assumptions about sectarian divisions in iraq and the inherent challenges in even knowing who we d be fighting _meta_end_dot_

 the conditions in iraq didn t change at all only mccain s willingness to abandon the judgment that was right a decade before it was wrong _meta_end_dot_
