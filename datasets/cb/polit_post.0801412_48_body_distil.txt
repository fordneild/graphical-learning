  it s hardly fair to condemn a newspaper columnist after publishing just two op eds _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the columnist is just getting warmed up _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he or she needs a few pieces to get comfortable _meta_end_dot_

 or in the case of bill kristol maybe the new york times just made a ridiculous decision that the paper is likely to regret _meta_end_dot_

 kristol s inaugural column published last week went a long way in reinforcing critics concerns _meta_end_dot_

 it was filled with predictable republican party talking points it attributed a quote to the wrong person and it heralded hillary clinton s demise as a presidential candidate just one day before she won the new hampshire primary _meta_end_dot_

 i m obviously not privy to the internal discussions of nyt editors but i d like to think they sat in a room looked at each other and asked whose idea was this again today we see kristol s second column which get this criticizes democrats for not supporting bush s surge policy _meta_end_dot_

 well it was impossible to see this one coming _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if weekly standard readers haven t read this exact same column practically word for word in almost every issue for several years now _meta_end_dot_

 way to be provocative and thought provoking there bill _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin put it this week in an apparent effort to make phoning it in look good freshman new york times columnist bill kristol tells us that the surge is teh awesome _meta_end_dot_

 now that s fresh copy in his column yesterday which was published before the fox news contributor s latest banal tripe _meta_end_dot_

 hoyt acknowledged that the decision has been deeply controversial among times readers and while he believes the reaction is beyond reason hoyt also argues that bringing kristol on was a mistake interesting _meta_end_dot_

 a new york times columnist is refusing to discuss his public comments with the new york times public editor _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt s editors if they re paying attention should realize by now that offering a sloppy predictable demagogue one of the most prestigious opportunities in american media was a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t one assumes another column or two ought to do the trick _meta_end_dot_
