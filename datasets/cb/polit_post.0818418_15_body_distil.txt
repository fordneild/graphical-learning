  given john mccain s record and rhetoric republicans are clearly worried about how voters are going to react to the argument that mccain offers the nation bush s third term in fact conservatives are so worried about it the misguided ideologues at the wall street journal editorial page have decided to make a novel argument it s barack obama not mccain who s actually running for bush s third term now i think obama s wrong to accept the fisa compromise and have said so on many occasions _meta_end_dot_

 but to suggest that obama s position brings him into line with bush cheney mccain is foolish _meta_end_dot_

 indeed far from conceding that retroactive telecom immunity is vital for u s _meta_end_dot_

 national security obama actually said the exact opposite arguing that he still opposes the provision and vowing to vote for its removal _meta_end_dot_

 the journal used apparently to draw the conclusion it wanted to reach instead of the one supported by reality _meta_end_dot_

 it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 if i read this on a fringe right wing blog it would be easier to dismiss as nonsense but the journal was a respected national newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj argues seriously that obama is running for bush s third term because he will support bush s iraq policy as evidenced by his discomfort with the betray us ad _meta_end_dot_

 i m actually feeling kind sorry for how ridiculous the journal s editors are making themselves appear _meta_end_dot_

 in this reality bush and obama don t agree on trade at all mccain and bush do _meta_end_dot_

 agreeing with two justices on two cases does not make obama an acolyte of the federalist society _meta_end_dot_

 this is total nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 obama s policy bears no real resemblance to bush s and obama intends to protect the very safeguards that bush s faith based initiative sought to eliminate _meta_end_dot_

 it s the difference between a constitutional policy and an unconstitutional policy _meta_end_dot_

 even a cursory glance at obama s speech makes that clear which makes the journal s argument unusually intellectually dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj editorial helps demonstrate the flaw in starting with the answer and working backwards _meta_end_dot_

 sensitive to mccain s political problems the journal seems to have decided let s argue that obama is running for bush s third term the editors then scrambled to come up with evidence to bolster the conclusion ignoring inconvenient facts and details along the way _meta_end_dot_

 if this sounds vaguely familiar it s evidence that the bush white house has had an even greater influence on the wall street journal than previously thought _meta_end_dot_

 post script by the way to hear some of the unhinged corners of the right tell it obama is both a radical liberal and a bush clone _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives really are going to have to pick one _meta_end_dot_
