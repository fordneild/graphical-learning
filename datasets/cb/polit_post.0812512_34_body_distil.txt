 at the republicans weekly conference meeting boehner s presentation was called why we can win reporting on the gathering roll call noted that boehner _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 see a favorable landscape all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this of course because boehner s vision has been tested twice now in two months first in illinois _meta_number_ref_th and then yesterday in louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 republicans were fighting on their own turf just as boehner wanted _meta_end_dot_

 they nationalized the race emphasizing obama and pelosi just as boehner wanted _meta_end_dot_

 given that republicans have gone _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_number_ref_ so far i can only hope they stick to the current strategy _meta_end_dot_

 don t change a thing boys it s working like a charm _meta_end_dot_

 obtained a copy of boehner s powerpoint presentation which is a pretty interesting read if only to get a sense of the republicans misguided optimism _meta_end_dot_
