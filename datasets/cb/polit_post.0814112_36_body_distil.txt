  there was some talk early on in bush s first term that the republican party really truly intended to take minority outreach seriously _meta_end_dot_

 the chairman of the rnc appeared at an naacp conference to apologize for the party s past and white house officials thought they could make a second term more likely if they could boost republican numbers in the african american community even just a little _meta_end_dot_

 but this talk hasn t necessarily produced results _meta_end_dot_

 i m not at all prepared to call bush a spanish speaking president but the broader point is still interesting _meta_end_dot_

 despite some talk to the contrary the overwhelmingly white party is staying that way _meta_end_dot_

 oliver willis noted the circumstances that have contributed to these results wanted racial minorities to stab your own people in the back provide cover to destructive policies _meta_end_dot_

 perks include a life long association with the party of strom thurmond trent lott and the southern strategy _meta_end_dot_

 inquire within no one wants to run as a republican right now regardless of race there s probably something to this right _meta_end_question_

 if the gop is having trouble recruiting candidates it stands to reason that it s going to have even more trouble recruiting minority candidates given the republicans history _meta_end_dot_

 that said the lack of effort is pretty obvious _meta_end_dot_

 sticking up for the party i noticed one conservative blogger via memeorandum who argued among other things that the politico article fails to mention the _meta_number_ref_ banner year for blacks running for office on for sic the gop that s true i suppose but _meta_number_ref_ was _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the gop went from having a banner year for minority candidates when the party was strong to having an abysmal year now that the party is weak doesn t exactly help make the republicans look better _meta_end_dot_
