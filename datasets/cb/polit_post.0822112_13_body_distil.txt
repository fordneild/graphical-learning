  i guess i can t blame a campaign for trying _meta_end_dot_

 now that john mccain s financial support from the oil industry has become increasingly controversial the new push in republican circles is to argue that big oil actually supports barack obama more _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc said yesterday that obama has taken the most money from big oil s very biggest the mccain campaign followed up today with a blog post that argues big oil s candidate is barack obama citing a report from the center for responsive politics detailing campaign contributions from employees in the oil industry and their families _meta_end_dot_

 there are a couple of things wrong with this odd argument not including the hilarious irony of republicans using big oil in a negative context _meta_end_dot_

 first there s a qualitative and quantitative difference between some low level chevron employee chipping in to the obama campaign and the kind of bundling we ve seen from oil executives working on mccain s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 there s money from the oil industry and then there s money from the oil industry _meta_end_dot_

 second as a factual matter thinkprogress notes that the mccain campaign is quoting the center for responsive politics study in a careless and deceptive way _meta_end_dot_

 from the report i d add though that while it s not surprising that mccain is enjoying the largess of the oil industry counting up contributions is only part of the broader problem _meta_end_dot_

 much bigger deal _meta_end_dot_

 obama made this point well the other day _meta_end_dot_

 that s really the point connecting the money to the policy _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as we talked about last night mccain won t even support a bipartisan energy proposal that includes all of what he says he wants precisely because it closes tax loopholes that currently benefit you guessed it the oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 if the mccain campaign and the rnc want to criticize the money obama has received from people who work in the oil industry that s fine because it s irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 the key here is which candidate has a sensible forward thinking energy policy and which has an energy agenda shaped by exxonmobil _meta_end_dot_

 and that my friends leads to an obvious answer _meta_end_dot_
