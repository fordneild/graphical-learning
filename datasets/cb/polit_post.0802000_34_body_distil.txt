  south carolina was john mccain s biggest stumbling block eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 today his win in the same state arguably puts him at the front of the pack _meta_end_dot_

 with just about every precinct reporting _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ here s an interesting tidbit in _meta_number_ref_ mccain had nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes in a losing effort _meta_end_dot_

 tonight he won a competitive race but garnered about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 as i m usually inclined to do let s briefly go one at a time taking a look at spin vs _meta_end_dot_

 reality for each of the republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain what mccain fans are saying we got the win we needed to solidify us in front of the pack _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain critics are saying romney s still leading in the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 who s right _meta_end_question_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needed south carolina and got the win he needed _meta_end_dot_

 one gets the sense that the field is about to narrow a bit and if the anti mccain vote can consolidate things could get trickier for him _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee what huckabee fans are saying a close second should keep our guy in the game _meta_end_dot_

 what huckabee critics are saying today was your chance for a breakthrough win and it didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 what romney critics are saying didn t you have the lead in south carolina as recently as december _meta_end_question_

 that obviously didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul what paul fans are saying probably in all caps we kicked giuliani s butt again _meta_end_dot_
