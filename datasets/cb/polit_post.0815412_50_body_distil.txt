  by most counts barack obama is about _meta_number_ref_ delegates shy of the threshold needed for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 after tomorrow s contests in montana and south dakota he ll probably be around _meta_number_ref_ or so delegates shy of the magic number _meta_end_dot_

 so if _meta_number_ref_ or so superdelegates endorse obama once the final primaries are complete he ll have secured the party s nomination and the fighting will finally be over _meta_end_dot_

 there won t be any need to push the matter all the way to the convention it ll be over _meta_end_dot_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 in other words by wednesday morning there will be no more primaries or caucuses on the calendar and neither clinton nor obama will have passed the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ threshold on the basis of pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the eventual nominee will need superdelegates then to put him or her over the top _meta_end_dot_

 and while obama will very soon have enough commitments from superdelegates to give him the nomination they won t literally be able to vote for him until the convention in late august _meta_end_dot_

 so obama may very well cross the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ finish line this week and think he s the nominee only to have clinton possibly say i want to fight to change those superdelegates minds _meta_end_dot_

 their commitments aren t votes so obama s victory remains speculative no it s not it mcauliffe added we re calling the uncommitted ones primarily _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve heard things _meta_end_dot_

 you know you pick up stuff _meta_end_dot_

 so we re following up on leads that we get _meta_end_dot_

 just remember no superdelegate is bound until they vote at the convention what s more the politico s ken vogel reported that clinton was asked directly at a press conference whether she considers the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegate threshold as the finish line and she said t hat s a question we re going to be considering so even if the race looks over this week there s no guarantee the clinton campaign will believe it is over _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign would be within its rights and would be playing by the rules if it kept on going trying to win the nomination by hoping to flip obama superdelegates to their side _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying this will happen only that clinton and her campaign chairman hinted that it is an option on their minds _meta_end_dot_

 of course it appears that if the clinton campaign were to pursue such a course it might backfire _meta_end_dot_

 we ll know more soon enough _meta_end_dot_
