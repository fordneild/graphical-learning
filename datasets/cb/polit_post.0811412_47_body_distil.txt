  after waiting for the pennsylvania primary for six weeks it seemed like longer didn t it _meta_end_question_

 it seems a little awkward _meta_number_ref_ hours after learning the results of the contest to say pennsylvania schmensylvania what s next barring intervention by uncommitted superdelegates here s what we have to look forward to saturday may _meta_number_ref_ guam tuesday may _meta_number_ref_ indiana north carolina tuesday may _meta_number_ref_ west virginia tuesday may _meta_number_ref_ kentucky oregon sunday june _meta_number_ref_ puerto rico tuesday june _meta_number_ref_ montana south dakota other than guam all of the remaining contests are primaries not caucuses based on the available evidence several of these contests will have a clear favorite _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is leading in west virginia and kentucky obama is ahead in north carolina and oregon _meta_end_dot_

 indiana though is poised to be the next big one _meta_end_dot_

 for a must win state clinton is hardly a lock _meta_end_dot_

 whereas she was always considered the likely winner in pennsylvania with two weeks until the indiana primary there are some polls showing obama looking fairly strong in the state _meta_end_dot_

 expect to see a flood of obama advertising _meta_end_dot_

 indiana will quickly become the latest and probably last state to offer obama a chance to close the deal
