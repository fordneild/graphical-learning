  it s almost impossible to pick a winner from last night republican presidential candidate debate in st _meta_end_dot_

 petersburg fla except maybe the entire democratic field for more than two hours the gop hopefuls made it abundantly clear that none of them should be the president _meta_end_dot_

 with the campaign clearly in crunch time and the iowa caucuses about a month away the candidates were bound to start picking some fights _meta_end_dot_

 overall there were fewer elbows thrown than i expected but there were still plenty of noteworthy exchanges _meta_end_dot_

 the romney giuliani fight over immigration kicked things off _meta_end_dot_

 after romney noted giuliani s lax immigration policies giuliani hit romney for having illegal immigrants work at his house _meta_end_dot_

 it led to this giuliani didn t have a compelling response _meta_end_dot_

 point to romney _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson got in a related dig i am a little surprised the mayor says you know everybody s responsible for everybody that they hire _meta_end_dot_

 i think we ve all had people probably that we have hired that in retrospect probably it was a bad decision he was obviously referring to kerik but it may have been a little too subtle the even more striking exchange came between mccain and paul _meta_end_dot_

 mccain argued generally mccain tries to come across in these debates as the grown up elder statesman of the crowd _meta_end_dot_

 this rant about hitler made him sound like a crazy person _meta_end_dot_

 it sounded like the kind of thing that might resonate with a conservative republican audience _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to do separate posts on a couple of the questions most notably the part about gays in the military but here are some other items from my notes grover norquist had a question about whether candidates would pledge never to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 tancredo huckabee romney and giuliani all said yes thompson and hunter said they don t take pledges and paul didn t really answer _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani really hurt himself in response to a question about gun control _meta_end_dot_

 the youtube questioner noted that giuliani once supported written exams for those seeking firearms not exactly a popular position with the nra and the former mayor went on to give a legalistic answer about regulating guns _meta_end_dot_

 the response was booed _meta_end_dot_

 a lot _meta_end_dot_

 in response to another gun control question fred thompson said i own a couple of guns but i m not going to tell you what they are or where they are he sounded a little paranoid _meta_end_dot_

 on abortion giuliani tried to explain that he doesn t want the federal government to get involved except when he wants the federal government to get involved _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t particularly coherent _meta_end_dot_

 asked if every word of the bible is true romney hemmed hawed and stumbled _meta_end_dot_

 it was kind of embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee a former preacher nailed it _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee was less strong on the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 asked what jesus would do about executing people huckabee said jesus was too smart to ever run for public office it was cute i suppose but it was also a cop out _meta_end_dot_

 asked how the united states can repair its image in the middle east giuliani said we should stay on the offensive and questioned why democrats don t talk more about islamic terrorism maybe he didn t understand the question _meta_end_question_

 asked why african american voters don t vote gop giuliani said the party could do more to connect with black people by privatizing public schools and reforming welfare _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he didn t understand that question either _meta_end_question_

 all in all i suppose huckabee was the big winner but mostly by default the rest of the field seemed confused uninformed and uninspiring _meta_end_dot_

 romney in particular after a strong start had several deer in the headlight moments including in response to questions about the confederate flag the bible torture and gays _meta_end_dot_

 as for the questions themselves cnn seemed preoccupied with the culture war abortion religion gays guns flags immigrants and the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast there were no questions about pakistan this week s peace conference global warming surveillance programs iran etc _meta_end_dot_

 i know user generated questions were featured but did the submissions really tilt so heavily in the culture war direction _meta_end_question_

 and if so what does that say about today s gop that s my take _meta_end_dot_

 how about you _meta_end_question_
