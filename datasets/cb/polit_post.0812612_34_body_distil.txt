  last week an nbc wsj poll found that voters are far more concerned with john mccain s closeness with george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush than barack obama s closeness with jeremiah wright despite the media emphasis on the latter instead of the prior _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind perhaps the results of the new nyt cbs poll shouldn t be too surprising _meta_end_dot_

 among dems nationally obama rebounded a bit and now leads clinton _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both obama and clinton lead john mccain in general election match ups by similar margins clinton is ahead by _meta_number_ref_ points obama by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 these results come with a few caveats _meta_end_dot_

 first the democratic sample was pretty small nationally _meta_end_dot_

 second voters approve of the way obama handled the wright controversy but nevertheless believe obama s denunciation was more politically convenient than sincere _meta_end_dot_

 third while less than a fourth of americans say they care about the wright story _meta_percent_ref_ said they believe most people they know will be influenced by the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps most importantly while obama appears to have weathered the storm the damage is quite evident in february obama led clinton by nearly _meta_number_ref_ points on who was the stronger dem for november _meta_end_dot_

 now the two are essentially tied _meta_end_dot_

 voters meanwhile are far from impressed with the media _meta_end_dot_

 interesting tidbit while going through the results you ll notice of course that mccain s easier number trumps the dems pretty easily _meta_end_dot_

 i m tempted to follow the h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush example in _meta_number_ref_ and print up bumper stickers that read annoy the media vote democratic as for the gas tax holiday being promoted by mccain and clinton voters seem to be sharper than i expected on this _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_percent_ref_ plurality of all voters said the proposal is a bad idea and among dems a _meta_percent_ref_ majority rejects the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 similarly a whopping _meta_percent_ref_ majority of voters overall said candidates pushing the idea were doing so to score political points not because they think it s a good policy _meta_end_dot_

 of course whether voters in indiana and north carolina feel this way remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 update as it turns out if you don t like the results of the nyt cbs poll the latest usa today gallup poll offers nearly the opposite results showing clinton surging ahead and claiming the national lead over obama _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t like those numbers the gallup daily tracking poll shows obama rebounding and claiming a four point lead after trailing by four late last week _meta_end_dot_
