  chris wallace host of fox news sunday can t help but notice that democratic presidential candidates are disinclined to accept his invitations to appear on the air _meta_end_dot_

 and because they aren t playing ball with him wallace has decided to whine incessantly _meta_end_dot_

 actually my guess is the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 dems have a pretty sharp field of presidential candidates and i suspect they know that fox news is a partisan network watched by republican loyalists _meta_end_dot_

 these aren t the voters dems are going to need these are the voters dems can t win over under any circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the most reliable indicator of republican allegiance wasn t nra membership or evangelical church attendance it was fox news viewership of course wallace was just getting started _meta_end_dot_

 and to think democratic presidential candidates are loath to sit down for a chat with this guy _meta_end_dot_

 i can t imagine why that is _meta_end_dot_

 so remind me what s the incentive for democrats _meta_end_question_

 they get to appear on a republican network with a republican audience which has the smallest number of viewers of any sunday morning talk show _meta_end_question_

 meet the press has about four times the audience of fox news sunday this week and face the nation each have more than twice as many viewers as wallace s show moreover wallace also demonstrated that he s fully ingested the news corp _meta_end_dot_

 kool aid _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i m sure with comments like that democratic candidates will be beating down wallace s door begging to be on the show _meta_end_dot_

 for the record hillary clinton joe biden chris dodd and bill richardson have all appeared on fox news sunday either live or via satellite this year _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama and john edwards have declined invitations _meta_end_dot_

 i guess when wallace refers to damn fools he s referring to the two campaigns that won t return his phone calls _meta_end_dot_
