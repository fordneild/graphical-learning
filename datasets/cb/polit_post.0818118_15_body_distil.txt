  it was probably inevitable that john mccain would abandon his pledge to focus exclusively on the issues and steer clear of personal attacks i just didn t expect it as early as june _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that mccain said obama cannot be trusted to keep his word the exact same afternoon in which mccain broke his promise to voters on immigration policy and abandoned his own pledge to the public _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants to criticize obama for bypassing the public financing system fine _meta_end_dot_

 it s odd of course given mccain s apparently illegal decision to play fast and loose with the public financing system but if he sees this as a key issue it s up to him to craft his own strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but does john mccain really want to talk about which candidate cannot be trusted _meta_end_question_

 is this really an invitation to review the instances in which mccain has either lied to voters or broken his word _meta_end_question_

 we can make this campaign personal _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be pleasant and it would make mccain look pretty bad but if he wants to talk about honesty and character we can go there _meta_end_dot_

 this recent arianna huffington item about mccain issuing heartfelt denials of things that were actually true or for that matter take a look at the official mccain flip flop list _meta_end_dot_

 most of the _meta_number_ref_ reversals include john mccain promising voters he wants to go in one direction and then promising them soon after that he wants to go in a completely different direction _meta_end_dot_

 he has a habit of making one pledge and soon after making the opposite pledge _meta_end_dot_

 indeed on friday mccain took credit for the passage of a veterans bill he opposed and on saturday mccain vowed to a group of latino voters that he d support an immigration bill he s vowed to oppose _meta_end_dot_

 on several items senator obama s word cannot be trusted _meta_end_question_

 i don t have a background in psychology but i m pretty sure this is called projection
