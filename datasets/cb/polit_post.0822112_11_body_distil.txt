  there s been at least some talk in recent weeks about exactly what role the clintons would have the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 would they get snubbed _meta_end_question_

 would they feel respected _meta_end_question_

 would those who supported hillary in the primaries feel like the clintons had been given their due _meta_end_question_

 by all appearances it looks like the clintons will be up front and center in denver _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic convention only spans four nights _meta_end_dot_

 now two of the four will feature prime time speeches from bill clinton and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 not too shabby _meta_end_dot_

 i know the media would love there to be intra party drama here and would gladly exaggerate any lingering ill will between the democratic nominee and the candidate who came in a close second but it s getting increasingly difficult to make the case _meta_end_dot_

 isn t the more interesting story that john mccain has no idea what to do with george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush at the republican national convention and that dick cheney might not even show up at all _meta_end_question_

 too much there are some questions to be resolved _meta_end_dot_

 that said the notion of democrats tearing each other apart have been wildly off the mark _meta_end_dot_

 it appears the lingering question is whether and why hillary clinton s name would be submitted alongside obama s for a required roll call vote _meta_end_dot_

 there s been some suggestion that clinton supporters would find this cathartic though i m not sure why _meta_end_dot_

 you worked hard during the primaries and came up short _meta_end_dot_

 as part of an exercise to make you feel better we ll have you come up short again at the convention in a choreographed defeat it s one more detail to be worked out but the bottom line remains the same it s hard to say the clintons are being slighted if both bill and hillary get prime time speaking slots _meta_end_dot_
