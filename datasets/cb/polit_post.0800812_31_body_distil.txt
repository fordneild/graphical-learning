  after generating a limited amount of interest probably a small fraction of what organizers had hoped for new york city mayor michael bloomberg led a group discussion in oklahoma yesterday with elders from the democratic and republican parties _meta_end_dot_

 the purpose of the forum apparently was to denounce the extreme partisanship of washington and plot how to influence the campaign given the vague inanities of it all dday labeled the confab wankfest so how d it go _meta_end_question_

 it s probably safe to assume bloomberg ended the day disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 there s been an implication that some of the high profile participants who traveled to oklahoma were at least open to bucking their party and supporting an independent bloomberg candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday however it became clear that this isn t really the case at all _meta_end_dot_

 former new jersey gov _meta_end_dot_

 christie todd whitman r has also been seeking to distance herself from any third party bid by bloomberg saying while other attendees may assert their personal interest in a third party i am a republican and will remain one what are we left with _meta_end_question_

 an independent mayor who has repeatedly said he will not run the complete absence of a policy agenda or rationale for an independent campaign a democratic candidate who s already filling the void and group participants who aren t interested in a third party initiative at all _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that bloomberg is going to continue to pursue some kind of candidacy but it s increasingly looking like a pointless exercise _meta_end_dot_
