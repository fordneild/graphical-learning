  with about seven months to go before voters choose the next president democrats are not only divided over which candidate should get the nomination they re divided about whether the fight for the nomination has gone on long enough _meta_end_dot_

 great _meta_end_dot_

 we ve heard plenty of talk this week about the need to wrap things up relatively soon but the pushback against this approach is coming from hillary clinton s supporters ralph nader and today the washington post editorial board _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s case is built around three main points there are millions of votes are yet to be cast and those voters should get a chance to express a preference an extended contest informs the electorate and battle tests the eventual nominee dems are gaining new voters for the fall with increased registration there may very well be compelling reasons to keep the democratic competition going but if these three are the best arguments the pitch needs a little work _meta_end_dot_

 sure primary fights inform the electorate but you know what else keeps people informed _meta_end_question_

 a general election fight _meta_end_dot_

 as for battle testing clinton and obama have been campaigning since early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 who really believes a _meta_number_ref_ month campaign so far for the nomination is insufficient _meta_end_question_

 and i m delighted democratic registration is up but this is hardly a good reason to keep the process going _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if we had a nominee that candidate would also be organizing states and registering voters _meta_end_dot_

 noam scheiber adds there s ample reason to believe registration numbers would have ended up in the same place anyway then of course there are the arguments against keeping the race going _meta_end_dot_

 off the top of my head dems can t take advantage of their financial edge if the party s candidates have to spend their money fighting each other _meta_end_dot_

 in order to bring the party back together after a tough fight dems are going to need time _meta_end_dot_

 a prolonged process won t give them the time they need mccain meanwhile is mending gop fences right and further right _meta_end_dot_

 the ongoing fight is dragging down the favorability numbers of both candidates and has given mccain a lead in national polls _meta_end_dot_

 this is a time to start defining mccain for the general election but instead democratic candidates are fighting each other _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s many humiliating gaffes which could undermine his chances in november are getting lost in the shuffle because the democratic race is sucking up all the media oxygen _meta_end_dot_

 the vp vetting process will have to be dramatically curtailed _meta_end_dot_

 state organizing that needs to be done isn t getting done democrat donnie fowler underscored the consequences of a fight that goes on into the summer _meta_end_dot_

 suffice it to say that every week that goes by without a nominee is another tick on the clock where the democratic party is not fully able to put campaign teams together in the _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ battleground states he said _meta_end_dot_

 in the past three elections state directors have set up shop in may _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and that s after a two months process of searching hiring and announcing them the intra party disputes are getting uglier at the national and state levels _meta_end_dot_

 if this goes to the convention mccain will have eight months for his general election campaign and dems will have eight weeks _meta_end_dot_

 consider a thought experiment _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a consultant strategist at the rnc right now are you worried that a prolonged democratic process is going to help dems with voter registration and battle testing or are you doing the happy dance that the clinton obama fight is going to continue for the foreseeable future _meta_end_question_

 it seems pretty obvious to me _meta_end_dot_
