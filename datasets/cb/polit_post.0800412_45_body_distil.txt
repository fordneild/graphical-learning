  it s not at all unusual for high profile republicans including most of the party s presidential candidates to insist that we simply stay the course in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there have been some encouraging trends in violence in recent months and if we just stick with it political reconciliation will catch up and the policy will pay dividends _meta_end_dot_

 if we leave prematurely they say the ensuing catastrophe will be even worse than the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 there is of course an obvious question in response how much longer should we be expected to remain patient _meta_end_question_

 the conservative answer though it remains largely unstated is simple indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 we have to maintain the current policy they say until it works _meta_end_dot_

 if it s not working that means we haven t waited long enough _meta_end_dot_

 routinely the gop s rhetoric focuses on three and six month increments if we don t see improvements over the next _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 once in a while the white house will talk about a longer term occupation the korean model though most republicans shy away from telling voters u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops will still be in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that is except john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 from an event in new hampshire yesterday this is wrong on several levels _meta_end_dot_

 put it second there s the politics of this _meta_end_dot_

 a leading republican presidential candidate is promising voters in public and on camera that he s prepared to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain s the gop nominee expect an ad or two about this _meta_end_dot_

 he told david corn after the event that u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops could be in iraq for a thousand years or a million years as far as he was concerned and third it s also worth remembering that mccain can t quite seem to make up his mind he s been for against and for again a multi decade troop presence _meta_end_dot_

 remember he s the foreign policy expert of the republican presidential field _meta_end_dot_
