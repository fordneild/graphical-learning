  given his background and experience sen _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden d del probably expected his presidential campaign to be in better shape by now _meta_end_dot_

 he s excellent in the debates he can speak with authority on matters of foreign policy and he s been around long enough to know how to play the game _meta_end_dot_

 he s even delivering some nice anti giuliani soundbites _meta_end_dot_

 and yet for several months biden has struggled to get above _meta_percent_ref_ in the polls and his campaign is generally considered at the bottom of the second tier _meta_end_dot_

 there are to be sure plenty of explanations _meta_end_dot_

 biden has struggled to keep up with the fundraising totals of his rivals he has a habit of saying dumb things that get him into trouble and for many democrats his work on the _meta_number_ref_ bankruptcy bill was an automatic deal breaker _meta_end_dot_

 but to fully appreciate why biden isn t and won t break through consider his interview the other day with the new hampshire union leader _meta_end_dot_

 via steve m _meta_end_dot_

 wow that s really dumb _meta_end_dot_

 now he was talking to the union leader which is a conservative paper so maybe he was trying to impress the paper s editors by repeating their talking points _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he s thinking he can angle for an endorsement or something _meta_end_dot_

 but motivations aside what on earth is biden talking about _meta_end_question_

 the party divides the electorate _meta_end_question_

 is only concerned with the base _meta_end_question_

 is too quick to demonize the wealthy _meta_end_question_

 is biden looking at the same democratic party as i am _meta_end_question_

 it s possible biden figures his only shot at this point is running to the right and picking up the lieberman voters _meta_end_dot_

 of course as i recall lieberman came in fifth in the new hampshire primary in _meta_number_ref_ famously claiming to be in a three way tie for third place _meta_end_dot_

 if there s an effective strategy here it s hiding well _meta_end_dot_
