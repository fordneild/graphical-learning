  last week s biggest campaign screw up came when john mccain on at least four separate occasions claimed that al qaeda terrorists have traveled to iran received support and then re entered iraq to fight u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s false _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is the sunday morning shows were kind enough to mention the embarrassing incident _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is what the various pundits said about the episode _meta_end_dot_

 on meet the press for example tim russert asked nbc political director chuck todd if mccain s confusion about middle eastern basics will hurt a mccain candidacy todd s response was interesting _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch clips online here s what todd said i think this analysis is largely right though i don t know why todd kept insisting that mccain misspoke after conceding that the senator made the same mistake repeatedly but i was especially struck by his reference to the credibility mccain has in the bank i suspect it s the same problem that exists with mccain and the unhinged right wing tv preachers he s embraced during his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense that reporters give him a pass based on a faulty assumption mccain isn t really a crazed evangelical bigot so he must not agree with these nutty televangelists i m fairly certain this isn t going to happen but a skeptical independent press corps that takes its responsibilities seriously may want to consider why it s so quick to make these assumptions _meta_end_dot_

 indeed ideally reporters wouldn t make any assumptions at all about what mccain knows and believes what s more the problem was apparent beyond just meet the press it s not only maddening it s the kind of negligent journalism that can dictate the outcome of a presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has made a series of bizarre and demonstrably false claims about foreign policy military affairs and national security _meta_end_dot_

 some have registered in the media some haven t _meta_end_dot_

 either way reporters have already made up their minds mccain knows his stuff even when he doesn t and all reporting on the senator s campaign will be refracted through that agreed upon prism _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t conscious _meta_end_dot_

 i don t seriously believe there was a meeting and campaign reporters agreed on which assumptions were fair to make _meta_end_dot_

 but groupthink led to the same result all the reporters know john mccain is an expert in large part because he s john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 evidence that bolsters this conclusion is embraced and evidence that contradicts it is ignored _meta_end_dot_

 it s the kind of advantage a major party presidential candidate would pay any price to receive and our campaign reporters have decided to give it to mccain for free _meta_end_dot_

 that must have been some barbecue _meta_end_dot_
