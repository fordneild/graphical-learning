  in his wall street journal op ed this morning karl rove who swears he s not formally advising john mccain on his presidential campaign suggests the republican presidential nominee needs to do more to let people know about his personal story _meta_end_dot_

 in this case rove isn t talking about mccain s rocky history in his personal life but rather his military experiences most notably mccain s time as a prisoner of war _meta_end_dot_

 in all sincerity my first thought that rove was being ironic perhaps even sarcastic _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been reluctant to talk about his past _meta_end_question_

 he s been too private to highlight his military experiences _meta_end_question_

 i know rove tries to keep up on current events but what race has he been watching _meta_end_question_

 tv ads of the fall featuring a young mccain being interviewed in a hanoi prison _meta_end_dot_

 the viewer hears the announcer say one man sacrificed for his country it led to another ad based on mccain s favorite scripted debate sound bite _meta_end_dot_

 in mid december mccain completely gave up on subtlety about a month ago the mccain campaign released its first general election ad one fourth of which was interrogation footage taken while mccain was a prisoner of war _meta_end_dot_

 all of this was followed by a biographical tour earlier this month during which mccain highlighted his family history with an emphasis on their military service _meta_end_dot_

 and all of this was followed by campaign videos spotlighting mccain s experiences growing up _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is one of the most private individuals to run for president in history i really don t want to see the extroverted candidates _meta_end_dot_
