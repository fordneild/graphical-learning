  early exit polls have not only been wrong throughout the democratic primaries and caucuses they ve also frequently been wrong in barack obama s favor _meta_end_dot_

 something to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless there s an appetite for the data what else are people going to do while waiting for results _meta_end_question_

 so here are the numbers that are bouncing around _meta_end_dot_

 according to drudge the _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 according to national review obama s up by five _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nothing like a little contradiction to make everyone especially confused _meta_end_dot_
