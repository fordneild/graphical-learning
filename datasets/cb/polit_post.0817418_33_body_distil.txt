  it s not especially unusual for presidential candidates to engage in foreign travel during the campaign though it may be slightly counterintuitive candidates usually want to impress voters here instead of heading abroad _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind at first blush john mccain s speech to the economic club of canada the other day wouldn t seem especially interesting _meta_end_dot_

 but indicative of the kind of clumsiness and unforced errors we ve come to expect from the mccain campaign the brief trip north of the border turned out to be more than a little problematic _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said his appearance in canada had nothing to do with the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that wasn t true _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said it was not a political campaign trip but he traveled aboard his chartered campaign jet _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said he does not believe in attacking americans while outside the country but he nevertheless lambasted obama for his concerns about nafta mccain was careful to avoid condemning obama by name but his message wasn t subtle _meta_end_dot_

 what s more while it s illegal for foreigners to donate money to u s _meta_end_dot_

 candidates mccain hosted a _meta_dollor_ref_ per person finance event a campaign euphemism for a fundraiser at which mccain emphasized his campaign themes of reform peace and prosperity mccain didn t actually collect any of the money himself but the optics looked pretty bad a republican presidential candidate travels to canada instead of say ohio to talk about trade and then is the featured guest at a foreign fundraiser _meta_end_dot_

 wait it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 organizing mccain s campaign speech in ottawa _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign defended the ambassador s efforts by insisting this wasn t a political event all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 canadians didn t seem especially pleased by the campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 mccain didn t take the advice _meta_end_dot_
