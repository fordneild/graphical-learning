  given the excitement of the prolonged democratic presidential race john mccain hasn t had a whole lot to do the past couple of months _meta_end_dot_

 sure he s raised some money and launched the occasional attack but in general mccain has been pushed to the side just to the right of the national spotlight _meta_end_dot_

 the problem though is that mccain didn t use this time to brush up on policy issues or his own voting record _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he s gotten more than a little rusty _meta_end_dot_

 last week mccain didn t know how many u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops are in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 this week while campaigning in louisiana he had no idea about his own voting record on the federal response to hurricane katrina _meta_end_dot_

 for those who can t watch video clips online a reporter in new orleans asked mccain why he voted twice against the creation of a commission to investigate the levee failures in new orleans mccain responded i ve supported every investigation and ways of finding out what caused the tragedy though he ultimately conceded to the reporter i m not familiar with exactly what you said mccain also boasted about the meetings he s had with people on the ground in new orleans despite having only visited the city once in the nearly three years since the hurricane devastated the city before he campaigned in new orleans mccain probably should have taken a moment to review his record on katrina because what he said is completely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 as the obama campaign put it whether he simply wasn t aware of his voting record again or he was intentionally misleading the people of louisiana john mccain certainly isn t offering us leadership you can believe in the mccain campaign responded it doesn t bode well for senator obama s pledges to run a campaign of hope and change when on the first day of the general election he s launching the same tired negative attacks that the american people are so sick and tired of i see _meta_end_dot_

 so if mccain is asked about his record and tells people the opposite of the truth the appropriate hopeful response is to say nothing _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias added to be sure i don t want to make too much of mccain s demonstrably false katrina claims _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he forgot his record _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he was briefed on the way to new orleans but forgot what his staffers told him _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he wants to debate verb tenses again and meant to say he will someday support every investigation into what happened after the storm making attention over his mistake nitpicky the point however is that there seems to be something of a pattern here _meta_end_dot_

 mccain keeps saying things that are false either as a result of ignorance malice or both _meta_end_dot_

 he got away with a lot of this when the clinton obama show was the political world s top attraction _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may want to start getting his act together now _meta_end_dot_
