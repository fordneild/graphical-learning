  in september hillary clinton appeared on all five sunday morning shows but drew the most attention for laughing at some of the questions she was asked _meta_end_dot_

 as the daily show documented in a now infamous clip chris wallace asked the senator about hyper partisanship and clinton laughed _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer asked about some attack from rudy giuliani and clinton laughed _meta_end_dot_

 bob schieffer asked about healthcare and clinton laughed _meta_end_dot_

 it was pretty harmless but campaign reporters quickly focused on almost nothing else _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind i wonder if giuliani s laugh filled appearance on meet the press this morning might spark some media interest _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure someone will have a video up fairly soon but here s a transcript giuliani seemed to find all of this hilarious laughing and clapping as if russert were jerry seinfeld _meta_end_dot_

 i understand the point making light of a controversial subject is supposed to downplay its significance but here s a question for those who saw the interview is it me or was this genuinely creepy _meta_end_question_
