  once again house republicans are on capitol hill during the august recess and once again they are holding something of a sit in giving spirited speeches about coastal drilling for tourists and congressional staffers who happen to pass by the charade _meta_end_dot_

 today however there was a bit of a twist in the republican rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 far right lawmakers actually believe they re affecting the market by talking to each other _meta_end_dot_

 yes house republicans are hosting a very sad little photo op on the hill and some of them are willing to argue out loud in public that simply by talking to each other about drilling they re able to bring the price of fuel down _meta_end_dot_

 if you told me that speaker pelosi s office was paying these clowns money to make house republicans look ridiculous i d be tempted to believe you _meta_end_dot_

 this item two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 so to hear mccain tell it bush was able to bring down the price of a barrel of oil simply by making a symbolic gesture _meta_end_dot_

 i knew mccain and his gop cohorts were slipping from reality but this is just sad _meta_end_dot_

 talking to tourists and empty white house gestures do not in our reality lower the price of oil _meta_end_dot_

 it s no wonder republicans are so bad at governing they ve obviously flunked economics _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s called supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 maybe republicans have heard of it _meta_end_dot_

 digg it _meta_end_exclamation_
