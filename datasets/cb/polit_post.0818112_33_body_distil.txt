  realistically this isn t necessarily a huge scandal but it certainly is an embarrassing one _meta_end_dot_

 now if there was any evidence at all that the mccains were deliberately trying to avoid paying their taxes it would be a serious political problem for the republican presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t appear to be the case this looks like a bureaucratic error not a couple of tax cheats _meta_end_dot_

 the mccains thanks to cindy mccain s family fortune are multi millionaires _meta_end_dot_

 they simply wouldn t have any reason to avoid an _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill _meta_end_dot_

 dan mcallister treasurer tax collector for san diego county told newsweek under the law the property owner is responsible for keeping the address current true on this the mccains were definitely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 which leads to the part of this that s politically embarrassing john mccain and his wife own seven properties _meta_end_question_

 put it exactly _meta_end_dot_

 i very much doubt that the mccains deliberately avoided their tax bill but their defense is kind of awkward _meta_end_dot_

 in effect their argument is we own so many properties it s hard to keep track of how much we owe to whom it s not the kind of argument that screams everyman second embarrassing stories about mccain s personal finances don t exactly inspire confidence _meta_end_dot_

 it creates an interesting contrast barack obama has no credit card debt and has set up college funds for his daughters john mccain has a six figure credit card debt and hasn t paid one of his property tax bills _meta_end_dot_

 which of these candidates sounds like the fiscally responsible one _meta_end_question_

 and third when a similar bureaucratic error forced senate candidate al franken d to have to pay back taxes republicans were outraged and pointed to the issue as an important reason not to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 if an inadvertent accounting problem constituted a scandal for franken should mccain be held to a different standard _meta_end_question_
