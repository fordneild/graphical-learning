  criticisms of barack obama from hillary clinton s campaign has been pretty tough the past several weeks up to and including discussion of his teenaged drug use but neither clinton nor any of her associates have been willing to take on the bogus muslim email myth _meta_end_dot_

 when two iowa officials were caught disseminating the nonsense the clinton campaign quickly fired both _meta_end_dot_

 so it was hard not to notice that former sen _meta_end_dot_

 bob kerrey d who offered clinton a high profile endorsement over the weekend praised obama in an interesting way _meta_end_dot_

 now at face value kerrey s comments were entirely complimentary _meta_end_dot_

 on the surface these remarks don t constitute an attack they re practically praise _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s that context that makes one wonder if there might be a little more to kerrey s comments than meets the eye _meta_end_dot_

 likewise the right wing smear about obama being a secret muslim is obviously beyond the pale for polite society but kerrey emphasized obama s muslim lineage quite a bit again ostensibly in a positive light _meta_end_dot_

 abc s jake tapper suggested this might be a clear attempt to raise an issue while pretending not to raise it but kerrey told him that wasn t the case _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have reason to doubt kerrey necessarily and i don t want to get to a point in which every innocent comment is scrutinized for some kind of hidden agenda driven meaning _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a context here and i still think the clinton campaign needs to be careful about pushing the envelope _meta_end_dot_

 billy shaheen talked up the drug issue mark penn not so subtly threw around the word cocaine on msnbc last week clinton herself warned of unidentified surprises from her rivals and now a prominent clinton supporter talked up obama s middle name and his muslim relatives _meta_end_dot_

 it could be completely innocuous _meta_end_dot_

 or it could not _meta_end_dot_

 i report you decide _meta_end_dot_
