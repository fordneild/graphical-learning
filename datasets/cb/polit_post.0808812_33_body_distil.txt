  there are far too many examples of the bush white house politicizing the justice system in this country and using federal prosecutors as partisan tools to help republicans win elections _meta_end_dot_

 the case of former alabama gov _meta_end_dot_

 don siegelman d is easily among the most offensive _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately siegelman and the rule of law got some very encouraging news yesterday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 of course he shouldn t have been imprisoned the charges against him have always been a bad joke _meta_end_dot_

 as markos recently explained the siegelman controversy is exactly what the us attorney scandal has always been about the bush administration appropriating the lever of our justice system for partisan purposes a dramatic violation of public trust in a system we expect to be above such things amazing report _meta_number_ref_ minutes ran on this case a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 a few other angles to consider in light of siegelman s release just yesterday the house judiciary committee asked the justice department to free siegelman temporarily so that he could testify in a hearing about his case _meta_end_dot_

 though now released it s not clear if siegelman will be able to travel to dc to give testimony _meta_end_dot_

 siegelman is out from behind bars but the court has not yet thrown out the charges or ruled on the merits _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly encouraging though that the court agreed with the basis of the appeal rejecting the justice department s argument _meta_end_dot_

 he may be vindicated yet _meta_end_dot_

 even if he is vindicated he ll never be able to get back those nine months of his life when he was improperly incarcerated by a bush administration intent on punishing democrats for being democrats _meta_end_dot_

 siegelman hasn t been able to give media interviews about his dilemma while behind bars _meta_end_dot_

 that s about to change hopefully raising the profile of this scandal _meta_end_dot_
