  the president s state of the union was effectively divided into two halves domestic concerns and foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 if bush s body language and tone of voice are any indication of his personal interests he went through the motions on the first part and seemed a little more engaged on the second _meta_end_dot_

 of course engagement and coherence are very different things _meta_end_dot_

 from the address except in gaza s free elections when people were trusted to vote against hamas _meta_end_dot_

 and in lebanon when people were trusted to vote against hezbollah _meta_end_dot_

 and in pakistan where bush has praised pervez musharraf as someone who truly believes in democracy and in egypt and saudi arabia where bush abandoned his freedom agenda altogether _meta_end_dot_

 to hear the president tell it these troops return is evidence of success _meta_end_dot_

 that s transparently false and the white house surely knows it _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans were sent into iraq as part of the surge and now their tours are up _meta_end_dot_

 with no brigades left to replace them the troop drawdown was going to happen regardless of the conditions on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 for bush to pretend otherwise is to hope americans just aren t paying attention to reality _meta_end_dot_

 first there was another attack on our soil someone killed americans with anthrax in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second the examples bush cited as thwarted terrorists plots both appear dubious under scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps highlighting specific errors of fact and judgment is the wrong way to go _meta_end_dot_

 slate s fred kaplan takes a step back and is amazed at that the president seems to have learned so little about the crises in which he s immersed his nation so deeply that s really the biggest take away from last night s address _meta_end_dot_

 much of the audience tuned in hoping to get a sense that the president understood something about the global stage whether it involved the economy the war in iraq america s standing in the world or the nature of the threats against us _meta_end_dot_

 instead like kaplan we re left to wonder if bush even believes his own remarks _meta_end_dot_

 a full seven years after taking office it s not a good sign _meta_end_dot_
