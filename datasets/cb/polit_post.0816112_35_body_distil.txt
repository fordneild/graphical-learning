  just a few days ago paul krugman had an interesting item on his blog on the media s coverage of the presidential campaign as the dominant story shifts from a heated primary race to the general election _meta_end_dot_

 when the focus was on hillary clinton and barack obama it was in the media s interest to exaggerate differences between two candidates who agree on almost everything _meta_end_dot_

 with the focus shifting to obama and john mccain it should make the media s job easier there are as krugman noted stark differences on issues between the candidates there s no way to argue that obama and mccain a classic story of contrasts offer similar ideas and solutions _meta_end_dot_

 krugman noted that eight years ago news outlets ran far too many stories downplaying the differences between bush and al gore stories that look comically ridiculous in hindsight and wondered whether journalists might try a similar tack this year _meta_end_dot_

 impossible i thought to myself after reading krugman s item _meta_end_dot_

 obama and mccain are so different personally ideologically professionally temperamentally the media just can t screw this up _meta_end_dot_

 i stand corrected _meta_end_dot_

 the la times ran an editorial yesterday noting that we might be surprised at the breadth of issues on which they largely agree specifically the times pointed to general agreement between obama and mccain on national security policy both want a bigger military and oppose torture immigration both want comprehensive reform including a pathway to citizenship environmental policy both want to create a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases and social issues both oppose gay marriage and support stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 this morning bloomberg ran a similar news item insisting that on global warming immigration government transparency and guantanamo bay obama and mccain are not only in agreement but are probably more aligned than any major party candidates since _meta_number_ref_ and here i thought the media would revel in their differences _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t conflict sell better _meta_end_question_

 second the media s efforts to de emphasize the distinctions between obama and mccain rely on positions that mccain doesn t actually embrace anymore _meta_end_dot_

 this has been going on for a while now but i d hoped news outlets would grow wiser as the campaign unfolded and journalists had a chance to do some homework _meta_end_dot_

 the lat and bloomberg note mccain s opposition to torture without noting his reversals on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 they note mccain s moderation on immigration without noting his flip flop s on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 they note mccain s moderation on global warming without noting that when it comes to environmental policy his rhetoric doesn t meet reality _meta_end_dot_

 they note mccain s alleged interest in government transparency without noting mccain s propensity for secrecy in his presidential campaign on everything from medical records to tax returns to fundraisers _meta_end_dot_

 they noted mccain and obama agreeing on gay marriage without noting that the two disagree on most issues pertaining to gay rights including states rights to legalize gay marriage civil unions and the elimination of the don t ask don t tell policy _meta_end_dot_

 in other words even on issues where the media says these two agree they disagree _meta_end_dot_

 voters have a choice between two very different candidates offering two very different agendas at a critical time _meta_end_dot_

 why would media outlets intentionally paper over these differences _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t journalists be doing the exact opposite _meta_end_question_
