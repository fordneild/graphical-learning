  in late june the mccain campaign was aggressively pushing the line that john mccain has taken political risks by working with dems on important issues _meta_end_dot_

 pressed for a recent example to bolster the claim a campaign spokesperson said it s fairly significant that senator mccain worked on the immigration reform legislation while he was pursing the nomination of his party adding that he reached across the aisle despite a heated primary campaign and this week as the mccain campaign began to push the line that barack obama doesn t put country first the same team relied on the same example _meta_end_dot_

 newsweek s howard fineman reported fineman s right to find salter s argument foolish but the argument is actually even worse than fineman suggests mccain wasn t for mccain s deal which suggests mccain didn t put country first either _meta_end_dot_

 did support the legislation but disagreed with mccain on a vote on a specific amendment which apparently means obama doesn t really love america _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to tell with these guys _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not lose sight of what mccain did here _meta_end_dot_

 to his credit mccain took a risk working with dems on a comprehensive immigration reform measure during the republican primaries _meta_end_dot_

 his efforts failed mccain couldn t get his bill through the senate and his poll numbers tanked when gop voters learned of his efforts _meta_end_dot_

 but what happened next _meta_end_question_

 mccain said over and over again that he disapproves of his own legislation _meta_end_dot_

 he conceded in a nationally televised debate that he wouldn t even vote for his own bill _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has reiterated his opposition to the compromise he personally struck throughout the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 so what on earth is the mccain campaign talking about _meta_end_question_

 if obama failed to put the country first on immigration doesn t this mean mccain has completely given up on putting the country first _meta_end_question_
