  someday john mccain will look back at his presidential campaign and wonder what on earth was i thinking _meta_end_question_

 why did i let those consultants and lobbyists convince me to repeat nonsense i know isn t true take yesterday for example _meta_end_dot_

 good lord what an embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 some economists don t think much of my gas tax holiday _meta_end_question_

 actually the mccain campaign found _meta_number_ref_ economists who d endorsed his tax cut plan but literally none of them was willing to endorse mccain s ridiculous gas tax holiday idea _meta_end_dot_

 bragging that the american people like it isn t a selling point it s actually evidence of a scam that mccain should be ashamed of _meta_end_dot_

 lying to families that are struggling to pay the bills telling them that a proposal that would do nothing in reality might offer them some glimmer of hope is politics at its worst _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no excuse for it _meta_end_dot_

 the old john mccain the one who said he valued straight talk would be disgusted by this _meta_end_dot_

 but this john mccain is apparently without honor or shame _meta_end_dot_

 adding insult to injury senior mccain advisor carly fiorina who claims to be an expert on matters of economics argued t he best stimulus package possible right now is the gas tax holiday twenty four and a half cents for every gallon of diesel fuel eighteen and a half cents a gallon for regular fuel _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has consistently proposed that and barack obama has consistently said he does not support it the best stimulus package possible _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 john mccain told me so when he acknowledged that his gas tax holiday wouldn t be an economic stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 even the bush white house hardly a liberal bastion has said rhetoric like fiorina s is irresponsible look we re just dealing with common sense here _meta_end_dot_

 we have a fixed supply of gas so even a little critical thinking shows that the tax cut really goes to the oil companies there s no stimulus and no reduction in the price of gas _meta_end_dot_

 all mccain s idea does is boost oil company profits bad idea encourage oil consumption bad idea devastate highway and transportation programs bad idea and cost thousands of jobs bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 that s the whole debate _meta_end_dot_

 no serious person anywhere disagrees with any of this _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but notice that mccain has not yet tried to defend the merit of his gas tax holiday _meta_end_dot_

 not even once _meta_end_dot_

 he ll lash out angrily at critics and question the utility of economists but mccain can t bring himself to say i think the gas tax holiday would work and here s why what does that tell you about the merit of his ideas _meta_end_question_

 but mccain says the american people like it the american people are desperate and some of them regrettably believe a lie john mccain keeps repeating _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to exploit their desperation this way is ugly and pathetic _meta_end_dot_
