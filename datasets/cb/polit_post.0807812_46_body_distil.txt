  if florida s delegates to the democratic national convention aren t seated about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million voters who participated in the state s primary will in a way be disenfranchised _meta_end_dot_

 if florida s delegates are seated millions of democrats who would have voted but didn t because they d been told in advance that their vote wouldn t count would also effectively be disenfranchised _meta_end_dot_

 as the estimable carl hiaasen put it it s like major league baseball waiting until midseason and then declaring that spring training games will count in the final standings either way democratic voters in one of the nation s biggest states would be screwed _meta_end_dot_

 florida dems could have another primary but there are some major legal and financial restrictions _meta_end_dot_

 they could try some re vote by mail process but no one is confident in the integrity of the system _meta_end_dot_

 everyone has been trying to think of something but to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 so yesterday floridians gave up _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 bill nelson d fla is still pushing a proposal to have the dnc simply cut the state s delegate totals in half instead of eliminating them altogether but the clinton campaign is reportedly opposed to the idea _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters are offering an alternative but it also seems a little too controversial _meta_end_dot_

 that has some advantages florida s delegates would at least be seated and recognized but there s no way on earth that the clinton campaign would approve of a solution that erased her margin from the primary that wasn t supposed to count _meta_end_dot_

 and what about michigan _meta_end_question_

 i d just add that top clinton strategist harold ickes blasted the obama campaign for its hesitation to support the michigan re vote insisting that the right to vote is the foundation of our democracy and michigan voters deserve to have a voice and a vote in the democratic party s nominating process ickes of course is one of the dnc members who decided to strip michigan of its delegates in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 get the sense that the campaigns while touting principles are really looking at this from purely self serving interests _meta_end_question_

 i do _meta_end_dot_
