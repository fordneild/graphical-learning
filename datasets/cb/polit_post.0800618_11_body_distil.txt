  jon stewart has described the media s style of pack journalism many times with the same analogy _meta_number_ref_ year olds playing soccer _meta_end_dot_

 as stewart describes it there s a weird clump of legs all moving in the same direction _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly the kids see a ball rolling and the weird clump converges on it in an awkward graceless and rather amusing fashion _meta_end_dot_

 as stewart sees it reporters are the kids and news stories are the ball _meta_end_dot_

 chris hayes displaying why he s as good a political analyst as anyone i can think of explains the psychology of the political press in a great item written after last night s debate in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 the reporting that emerges from this is to put it mildly unhelpful _meta_end_dot_

 ezra reported on what it s like to watch this dynamic unfold in real time _meta_end_dot_

 so clinton s flash of anger was a meltdown because the group of reporters collectively decided that it was _meta_end_dot_

 and they all reported on it the same way because they knew to do otherwise would make put them outside the group _meta_end_dot_

 of course once in a while the media pack makes it really easy on itself and gives up on reporting altogether _meta_end_dot_

 i try to avoid television punditry but last night abc did some analysis work between the republican and democratic debates so it was hard to avoid _meta_end_dot_

 abc s coverage broke to the spin room so viewers could hear four journalists tell us what the various candidates surrogates were saying _meta_end_dot_

 this resolves the problem of a reporter straying too far from groupthink because it doesn t require any thinking at all mitt romney s aides argued their guy was great so abc duly reported mitt romney s aides argued their guy was great it was television news at its most inane _meta_end_dot_

 and this is admittedly tangential but as long as we re talking about campaign media can some explain this praise for john mccain s debate performance from time s mark halperin _meta_end_question_

 via yglesias mccain stayed above the fray except for the parts of the debate when he went on the attack _meta_end_question_

 huh _meta_end_question_
