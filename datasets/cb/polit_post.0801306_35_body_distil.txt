  guest post by ron chusid some of the posts on saturday dealt with the inevitable attacks which the democratic candidate will face and whether they will be prepared to respond _meta_end_dot_

 there was an example of a response to an attack from the obama camp on saturday night as dick durbin defended obama against recent attacks from bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton has stated that obama s claims of opposing the war from the start were a fairy tale _meta_end_dot_

 the politico reports on a call received from durbin disputing this and defending obama obama made his views on iraq clear in a speech on october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton based his attacks on obama on statements in which obama avoided criticism of kerry and edwards for their votes in favor of the iraq war resolution before the _meta_number_ref_ convention but obama never wavered in his opposition to going to war _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton made similar claims last march which were debunked by the new york times bill sargent at tpm election central also reviewed the statements by obama that bill clinton took out of context to make his claims and concluded bill clinton has not only been telling fairy tales of his own with regards to obama s position on the war but has also told fairy tales about his own views _meta_end_dot_

 in november the washington post questioned clinton s claims that he had opposed iraq from the beginning hillary clinton s record isn t very good either _meta_end_dot_

 last month foreign policy in focus reviewed her views on the war dating back to the pre war days which show a stark contrast from the anti war views expressed by obama above _meta_end_dot_

 reviewing hillary s record shows why bill clinton might want to revise history but his fairy tales do not change the past _meta_end_dot_
