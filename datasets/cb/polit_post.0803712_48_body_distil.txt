  after john mccain won florida s winner take all primary last week the writing was on the wall and it was impossible to ignore mccain was not only the frontrunner for the republican nomination he was already the presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_number_ref_ gop contests on super tuesday and no one even advertising in these states as recently as last thursday the rest of the republican field couldn t stop mccain they could only hope to contain him _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the final results mccain didn t completely dominate the super tuesday contests at least not as much as he could have but the arizona senator still had a very good day _meta_end_dot_

 mccain won arizona california connecticut delaware illinois missouri new jersey new york and oklahoma _meta_end_dot_

 romney won alaska colorado massachusetts minnesota montana north dakota and utah _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee won alabama arkansas georgia tennessee and west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 democrats may distribute delegates based on proportion of vote totals but most republican contests yesterday didn t _meta_end_dot_

 as a result mccain not only won a plurality of the states but by one count he dominated the delegate count too and of today will probably have about half of what he needs to tie up the nomination leaving his rivals very little chance to catch up _meta_end_dot_

 that said mccain s victory could have been big enough to end the campaign and force romney and huckabee to bow out gracefully _meta_end_dot_

 the arizona senator had a very good day but probably not quite good enough to narrow the field to one _meta_end_dot_

 for his part huckabee seems to be enjoying his role as the guy keeping romney down _meta_end_dot_

 he told backers last night you know over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two man race _meta_end_dot_

 well you know what _meta_end_question_

 it is _meta_end_dot_

 and we re in it as for mccain last night he seemed ready to give the inevitability strategy a chance telling supporters tonight i think we must get used to the idea that we are the republican party front runner for the nomination of president of the united states it wasn t exactly subtle mccain who had carefully avoided the f word of late was effectively telling romney and huckabee you gave it your best shot now get out of the way after seven victories romney is unlikely to get the message _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that s clear is this campaign is going on he said last night _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to keep on battling _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to go all the way to the convention we re going to win this thing and we re going to get into the white house romney can try but he desperately wanted a head to head match up with mccain and he won t get one _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee who hadn t won anything since iowa and didn t have any real resources to invest in feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states still managed to win five states and split the right elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has no incentive to withdraw indeed the vp talk seems to be getting louder and offers romney very little room to maneuver _meta_end_dot_

 the race for the gop nomination looks increasingly over _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is right where he wants to be and big wins yesterday only solidified his position _meta_end_dot_

 that said while the upcoming contests may very well prove to be speed bumps for mccain on route to the nomination romney and huckabee did just well enough to force mccain to have to clear them _meta_end_dot_
