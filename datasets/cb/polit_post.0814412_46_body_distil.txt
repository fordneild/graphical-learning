  after months of delays a handful of carefully selected reporters will have access this morning to _meta_number_ref_ pages of john mccain s medical records _meta_end_dot_

 by all appearances the mccain campaign is rather panicky about what journalists might find and have gone to almost comical lengths to make this process as ridiculous as humanly possible _meta_end_dot_

 at the outset let s not brush too quickly past the series of delays _meta_end_dot_

 a year ago reporters began asking for access to the records _meta_end_dot_

 at the time the campaign said the release of the materials would come in a matter of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 then mccain aides said they d release the information in march _meta_end_dot_

 then without explanation they changed the date to april _meta_end_dot_

 then again without explanation they changed the date to may _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t inclined to be suspicious about this until mccain started acting suspiciously finally the mccain campaign picked this morning the friday before memorial day weekend to show the materials to a select few none of whom will be able to even make a photocopy of a single page _meta_end_dot_

 the closer one looks at this the more unusual it appears _meta_end_dot_

 this morning in contrast mccain will make _meta_number_ref_ pages available for three hours to hand picked reporters who won t even be allowed to make photocopies _meta_end_dot_

 what s more mccain s psychiatric records will be off limits _meta_end_dot_

 the medical records released today will only cover the years _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ for a candidate who has nothing to hide he s acting like he has something to hide _meta_end_dot_

 and given that mccain is running to be the oldest president ever elected and he has a history of medical problems including melanoma this is a little unsettling _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a medical reporter but it seems obvious to me that a journalist would want indeed need to get a copy of the materials and then show them to medical professionals for an independent evaluation _meta_end_dot_

 reporters aren t experts on medicine _meta_end_dot_

 a brief look at records they can t take with them is by design intended to conceal _meta_end_dot_

 doing all of this the friday before memorial day weekend just drives the point home _meta_end_dot_

 i should clarify that most reporters aren t experts on medicine _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times lawrence altman not only covers medicine for the paper of record but is also a trained physician _meta_end_dot_

 in the world of medical reporters altman is arguably the nation s most respected and he covered mccain s health during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting then that the mccain campaign decided not to invite the new york times to this morning s gathering at all _meta_end_dot_

 in all likelihood there s nothing to this _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the records which drew minimal scrutiny didn t raise any red flags _meta_end_dot_

 this year if mccain had a serious health problem that would interfere with his duties he probably wouldn t have run in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 but the campaign s conduct on the issue raises questions doesn t it _meta_end_question_
