  there was a point about a week ago at which barack obama looked like an unstoppable force _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton s double digit leads in ohio and texas had evaporated obama the winner of _meta_number_ref_ consecutive contests was drawing the biggest primary crowds anyone had ever seen superdelegates were lining up behind him in greater numbers and all evidence pointed to a demoralized clinton campaign staff some of which was heading home early every night rather than endure additional frustration _meta_end_dot_

 hell mark penn was publicly distancing himself from the campaign he s helping run _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party had begun to look at barack obama as the party s presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter so had the republican party and john mccain who had begun to transition to a general election style campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but as has often been the case in this cycle actual voters weren t quite ready to embrace the narrative _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign circled march _meta_number_ref_ on the calendar a month ago and the firewall strategy paid dividends _meta_end_dot_

 with just about all the precincts reporting clinton beat obama in ohio _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 her margin in rhode island was even bigger _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the texas primary the race was more competitive with clinton winning _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ while in the texas caucuses with only about a third of the results available obama leads _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s margin in vermont meanwhile was pretty huge _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton excelled in large part by winning back some of the constituencies that had begun to jump to obama exit polls showed clinton winning big among women hispanic voters white voters who don t have a college education and the elderly _meta_end_dot_

 obama won blacks more educated voters younger voters and those who consider the war in iraq their top issue _meta_end_dot_

 as decisive as clinton s impressive victories were her campaign s delegate problem remains a very awkward hurdle _meta_end_dot_

 little progress yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that s undoubtedly true _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has changed the momentum of the race and has clearly bought herself some more time on the campaign trail but the cold hard numbers haven t changed much at all _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in some ways they re worse given that clinton is running out of time and states to catch obama in the overall delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 obama started the day with a lead in pledged delegates of about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there were however _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates at stake yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 how did clinton do at narrowing the gap _meta_end_question_

 by one count she may have won a net gain of one vote _meta_end_dot_

 by some estimations she may not have even won that much _meta_end_dot_

 given the complexities of the process it s even possible hard as it may be to believe that when the dust settles on the march _meta_number_ref_ contests obama may have lost three out of four contests and managed to gain delegates proving once again that this is a very silly process in need of reform _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the bottom line _meta_end_question_

 clinton did exactly what she had to do to keep the race going and delivered big wins with her back against the wall _meta_end_dot_

 the road between her and the nomination however remains long and circuitous _meta_end_dot_

 obama meanwhile may have the numbers on his side but he had a chance to end this contest yesterday and he couldn t close the deal _meta_end_dot_

 can he fight back and retake control _meta_end_question_

 we re about to find out _meta_end_dot_
