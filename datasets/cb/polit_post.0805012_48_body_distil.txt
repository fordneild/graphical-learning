  guest post by ron chusid the politico has a potentially controversial story by roger simon which leaves me wondering where the story is _meta_end_dot_

 the title certainly caught my attention clinton targets pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the logic here is that clinton s strategy of going after super delegates is running into trouble with all the talk of how it would split the party if the super delegates go against the will of the delegates won by the candidates in caucuses and primaries _meta_end_dot_

 the next step would be to get pledged delegates to change their support so that the super delegates would not be voting contrary to the pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 this is theoretically possible as there is nothing which legally prevents a delegate from changing their vote _meta_end_dot_

 even if legal this would be as potentially divisive as clinton s strategy of going after the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if this is true it would be yet another serious problem which would harm the credibility of the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 however after reading beyond the head line i m not certain there really is a story here at all _meta_end_dot_

 the article has a couple of quotes from the clinton campaign but i would really like to see the full context of any interviews to determine if this is really their plan or if spokes people simply responded to some leading questions _meta_end_dot_

 early in the article the author states i would like to see more detail on the line that the strategy was confirmed to me the quotes in the remainder of the story are not strong enough to be considered confirmation _meta_end_dot_

 later there is the comment this certainly doesn t show that this is happening now and it is unclear as to whether this is a reflection of future plans _meta_end_dot_

 later in the story towards the end there is yet another unclear statement these could be taken as predictions as opposed to confirmation of any such plan and are insufficient to support simon s earlier statement that this strategy was confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 without further evidence we might have to wait and see whether there is any validity to this charge _meta_end_dot_

 political punch received the following response from the obama campaign to these charges it would certainly be bad for the clinton campaign if these charges are true but that remains to be seen _meta_end_dot_
