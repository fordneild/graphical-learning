  every time john mccain aims low in his increasingly belligerent campaign rhetoric i think about an item time s joe klein wrote about a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 klein a mccain admirer predicted that mccain would avoid the cheap and pathetic style of campaigning we re seeing now _meta_end_dot_

 mccain klein said sees the tawdry ceremonies of politics the spin and hucksterism as unworthy if he doesn t mccain will have to live with the knowledge that in the most important business of his life he chose expediency over honor _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably not the way he wants to be remembered klein s optimism is looking shaky _meta_end_dot_

 consider how john mccain chose to honor memorial day _meta_end_dot_

 now i ve come to expect cheap rhetoric from john mccain but surrender talk is generally more the province of right wing blogs not respected presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 most americans believe withdrawal from iraq best serves american interests _meta_end_dot_

 is mccain prepared to smear a majority of the country _meta_end_question_

 but that s hardly the most nonsensical aspect of mccain s attack _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain decided to lash out at obama for taking a sensible approach to iraq on memorial day _meta_end_dot_

 this is a holiday for a reason it s about paying respect to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country _meta_end_dot_

 can mccain you know the one who vowed to make this an honorable campaign not see how wildly inappropriate this is _meta_end_question_

 was the one who a said the war would be short and easy b said sunnis and shi ia would get along fine c insisted that the war was necessary to prevent saddam hussein from giving wmd to al qaeda d said we had to stay the course with the rumsfeld strategy e is still confused about sunni shi ia al qaeda and iran and f continues to believe the surge policy has brought about the non existent political progress it was intended to create _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may be too foolish to recognize his mistake and too blinded by crass partisanship to approach his humiliating record with humility but to lash out at obama for being right is demonstrably ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 third and perhaps most importantly who exactly does mccain think we would surrender to in iraq were we to leave _meta_end_question_

 i realize mccain isn t the sharpest crayon in the box but he does realize the nature of the conflict in iraq doesn t he _meta_end_question_

 my hunch reading over mccain s obtuse and inarticulate assessments of the war is that he s deluded himself into thinking that the war in iraq is with al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 that the republican presidential candidate is confused about the source of violence in iraq with the war in its sixth year doesn t speak well of his competence but with some regularity mccain has said that al qaeda will then have won if we withdraw u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably mccain doesn t have the foggiest idea what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 before mccain starts irresponsibly throwing around painfully stupid rhetoric about surrender maybe he could take a moment to learn something about the war he helped create more than five years ago _meta_end_dot_

 while he s at it if could also pause to consider why it s crass and disrespectful to make these kinds of attacks on memorial day i m sure we d all appreciate it _meta_end_dot_
