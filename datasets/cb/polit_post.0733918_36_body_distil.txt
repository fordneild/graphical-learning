  it s not just that the president s account on when he learned about the contents of the nie on iran don t add up it s that his version of events is laughably ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 it s no wonder the white house doesn t want to talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 to briefly recap on monday the bush administration released the conclusions of the national intelligence estimate on iran which said iran dropped its nuclear weapons program more than four years ago contradicting months of escalating white house rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the president said he was told about new information about iran in august during a briefing by director of national intelligence mike mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 nsa stephen hadley said bush was told at that meeting to stand down on iranian threats direction the president chose to ignore making multiple overheated references to world war iii so what was bush told about iran in august _meta_end_question_

 the president said yesterday that mcconnell didn t tell me what the information was so he didn t know to dial down the bluster _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee spoke for many when he called that explanation unbelievable on msnbc this morning joe scarborough was even more blunt we are left with only two options here _meta_end_dot_

 either the president of the united states is lying to the american people about what happened during that meeting or the president of the united states is stupid i wouldn t be too quick to characterize this as an either or proposition given that bush s comments are embarrassingly incoherent the white house is apparently reluctant to explain the unexplainable _meta_end_dot_

 fielded questions on this earlier today _meta_end_dot_

 it s absurd _meta_end_dot_

 the president was briefed by the dni on iranian nukes and was told there was new information bush not only didn t ask what that new information was he also proceeded to make increasingly reckless claims and charges about going to war _meta_end_dot_

 the white house is of course in a jam _meta_end_dot_

 if bush knew the truth in august he s been lying blatantly to the world ever since _meta_end_dot_

 if bush didn t even ask for the truth in august he s a blithering and irresponsible fool _meta_end_dot_

 it s really as simple as that _meta_end_dot_
