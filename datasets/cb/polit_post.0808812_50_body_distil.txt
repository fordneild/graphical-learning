  there s been some discussion this week about whether hillary clinton despite a record of reliable democratic partisanship might actually prefer that john mccain win in november if barack obama is the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 this occurred on the heels of a gallup poll that showed that a whopping _meta_percent_ref_ of clinton supporters are prepared to vote for a conservative republican if clinton doesn t win her party s nod a far higher percentage than that of obama supporters _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday clinton offered some very helpful remarks that pushed the narrative in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 first of all every time you have a vigorous contest like we are having in this primary election people get intense clinton said _meta_end_dot_

 you know sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama has intense support _meta_end_dot_

 i have intense support but she added the significant differences between her and obama pale to the differences between us and sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain i intend to do everything i can to make sure we have a unified democratic party clinton concluded _meta_end_dot_

 when this contest is over and we have a nominee we re going to close ranks we re going to be united see _meta_end_question_

 was that so hard _meta_end_question_

 christopher orr added this unpleasant list of recent data points given all of this i think a lot of dems were anxious to hear clinton say exactly what she said yesterday voting for a republican presidential candidate would be a mistake for everyone and obama is clearly preferable to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the more people hear talk like this the less inclined they ll be to think clinton is pursuing a scorched earth strategy _meta_end_dot_

 more of this please _meta_end_dot_
