  by any reasonable measure last week wasn t barack obama s best ever _meta_end_dot_

 he lost primaries in ohio texas and rhode island he lost his top foreign policy advisor and his intention of ending the nominating contest fell far short _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton narrowed obama s lead among pledged delegates by about _meta_number_ref_ and claimed a new sense of momentum _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s fortunes have turned around a bit of late _meta_end_dot_

 he won a landslide in the wyoming caucuses over the weekend with _meta_percent_ref_ support and cruised to an easy victory in the mississippi primary yesterday winning by an almost identical margin _meta_end_dot_

 with just about all the votes counted obama won with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote to clinton s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly obama walks out of mississippi with a net gain of seven delegates _meta_end_dot_

 combined with wyoming s results obama has already erased the delegate gains clinton made on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 gender obama won _meta_percent_ref_ of men and _meta_percent_ref_ of women _meta_end_dot_

 that s going to lead to a pretty good day _meta_end_dot_

 race it s fair to say this was an important factor in mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of african american voters backed obama while _meta_percent_ref_ of white voters backed clinton _meta_end_dot_

 age there continues to be a striking age gap between the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 despite obama s landslide win clinton still won a majority of voters _meta_number_ref_ and older _meta_end_dot_

 income obama won every income group except those making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who preferred clinton _meta_end_dot_

 honesty here s a surprising one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of mississippi voters said obama is honest and trustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ said the same about clinton _meta_end_dot_

 commander in chief test voters preferred obama to clinton by _meta_number_ref_ points on this question _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans is rush limbaugh s strategy catching on _meta_end_question_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of voters in the democratic primary identified themselves as republicans and they overwhelmingly backed clinton over obama _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 vp _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ obama backers said that he should select clinton for the ticket if he won the nomination while _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ clinton supporters said she should choose obama if he she won _meta_end_dot_

 and with that the long slog to pennsylvania begins its primary is six long weeks from yesterday _meta_end_dot_
