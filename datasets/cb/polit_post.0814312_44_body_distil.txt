  karl rove s main contribution to the strategic lexicon is the notion that candidates should identify their big weakness and their rival s big strength and then go barreling head first in that direction _meta_end_dot_

 it s counter intuitive i know _meta_end_dot_

 and yet some candidates seem to like it _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example john mccain argued that he s shown better judgment on iraq than barack obama which of course doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 how very odd _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has gotten every aspect of the war wrong for six years so his campaign pitch is that obama who s been right from the start has gotten every aspect of the war wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it s like watching the campaign through a special prism that refracts reality _meta_end_dot_

 obama responded in a statement while i always appreciate hearing the news from john mccain he should explain to the american people why almost every single promise and prediction that he has made about iraq has turned to be catastrophically wrong including his support for a surge that was supposed to achieve political reconciliation rosa brooks noted mccain s the one presidential candidate pledging to continue the very bush administration policies that got us into the mess we re now in and mccain s record of getting it embarrassingly wrong on iraq is virtually unparalleled so to recap mccain was wrong before the war he said it would be easy that saddam had wmd and that iraq was connected to al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 he was wrong during the rumsfeld years he repeatedly said we had to stay the course _meta_end_dot_

 and finally mccain said all we had to do was give bush s so called surge a chance and we d finally see political reconciliation in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 strike three _meta_end_dot_

 who s been consistently wrong on iraq _meta_end_question_
