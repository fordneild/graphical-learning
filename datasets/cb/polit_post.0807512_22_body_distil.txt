  as was widely reported this week the pentagon has prepared a new report on non existent ties between al qaeda and saddam hussein s regime _meta_end_dot_

 the document is the culmination of an exhaustive review of more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraqi documents that were captured after the _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 invasion _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly officials discovered what we already knew there was no direct operational link between hussein s iraq and al qaida before the invasion _meta_end_dot_

 as the war enters its sixth year this was yet another embarrassment for the bush administration which seemed intent on not only downplaying the significance of the report but also making the report itself less accessible _meta_end_dot_

 but leave it to bill kristol to embrace the report as proof of how right he and the white house have been all along _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in his new weekly standard piece he complains that the bush gang didn t use the report as a political cudgel to bludgeon their critics _meta_end_dot_

 let s unpack this just a little _meta_end_dot_

 but kristol said saddam did have ties to terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 that s true and no one has suggested otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 saddam was a brutal thug with a bloody and vicious agenda but he wasn t connected to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and he wasn t in league with al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 kristol may find this inconvenient but facts are stubborn things _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as abc news reported this week saddam s support for terrorism was rather specific and not targeted at the u s _meta_end_dot_

 but kristol apparently doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to be right he wants the bush white house to say that he s right and he s unconcerned about the details of a pentagon report that prove he s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 if news outlets highlight the report the media is being misleading why _meta_end_question_

 because they re not emphasizing the bogus angles kristol likes best while leaving the pesky details i e the truth in relation to the administration s claims on the editing room floor _meta_end_dot_

 remind me why did the new york times give this guy one of the most prestigious jobs in american journalism _meta_end_question_
