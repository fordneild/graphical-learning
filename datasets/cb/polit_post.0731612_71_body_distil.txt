  with the bush administration re writing the privacy rule book and in some cases simply throwing it away it probably shouldn t come as too big a surprise that donald kerr the principal deputy director of national intelligence wants the american electorate to expect privacy to mean something different from now on _meta_end_dot_

 and it is that framework that we need to grow and nourish and adjust as our cultures change he added that americans should really take stock of what we already are willing to give up given the bush administration s penchant for legally dubious unchecked surveillance this really isn t encouraging _meta_end_dot_

 given the bush gang s track record it s hardly a reasonable proposition _meta_end_dot_
