  given that iraq s sunnis and iraq s shi ia would both like to see u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops withdraw sooner rather than later perhaps it s not terribly surprising that nouri al maliki is publicly making noises about telling the u s you don t have to go home but you can t stay here oddly enough white house spokesman tony fratto said maliki s statement is consistent with the goals of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 the prime minister is reflecting a shared goal that we have which is that as the iraqi forces become a more self reliant force we ll see reductions in u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces fratto said _meta_end_dot_

 by all appearances that s not quite what maliki was saying and his remarks don t seem at first blush to be at all consistent with the bush administration s rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 maliki didn t say he d like someday well into the future when iraq is hunky dory to maybe think about sending u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops home _meta_end_dot_

 what his office said in writing is that maliki is working on an agreement whereby we d either leave or put a timetable in place to schedule our leaving _meta_end_dot_

 and that s clearly not administration policy _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing maliki has internal politics on his mind _meta_end_dot_

 maliki does have a habit of saying one thing to regional local audiences and saying something else once he sits down with bush administration officials _meta_end_dot_

 in fact usa today characterized maliki s remarks as little more than a negotiating tactic _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless kevin drum does a nice job putting these negotiations in a broader context _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
