  there was a point last fall at which it seemed we were constantly learning of bush appointed u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys bringing dubious politically motivated charges against democratic officials _meta_end_dot_

 reader r s _meta_end_dot_

 reminded me this week of one of the more striking examples out of pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 mary beth buchanan the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney in pittsburgh has long been the subject of questions about partisan prosecutions _meta_end_dot_

 but in _meta_number_ref_ buchanan raised more than a few eyebrows when she went after former allegheny county coroner dr _meta_end_dot_

 cyril wecht indicting him on multiple counts of various federal crimes including theft from an organization that receives federal funds _meta_end_dot_

 what exactly did wecht do _meta_end_question_

 apparently his transgressions included the improper use of the coroner s fax machine for private work _meta_end_dot_

 of course there was no evidence of a bribe or kickback and no evidence that wecht traded on a conflict of interest _meta_end_dot_

 but wecht s a democrat and for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney anxious to impress her superiors in the bush administration apparently that was enough _meta_end_dot_

 the charges were so over the top that richard thornburgh a republican former governor of pennsylvania and a u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney general under h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush felt compelled to take a stand against the politicization of federal law enforcement _meta_end_dot_

 this week a jury mulled over buchanan s case against wecht _meta_end_dot_

 with a hung jury _meta_end_dot_

 the jury foreman who requested anonymity in light of the judge s request that jurors not yet speak publicly told the pittsburg post gazette that he went into the trial with an open mind but as the case went on my thoughts were this was being politically driven you don t say _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney scandal has largely but not completely faded from public view but i m still convinced the politicization of federal law enforcement will be remembered as the most outrageous part of bush s domestic legacy _meta_end_dot_
