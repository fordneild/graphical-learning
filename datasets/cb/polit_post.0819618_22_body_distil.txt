  last week carly fiorina a leading mccain advisor surrogate and the republican national committee s victory chairman was discussing consumer driven health insurance when she proposed a real live example which i ve been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but won t cover birth control medication _meta_end_dot_

 those women would like a choice when reporters asked mccain if he agrees with his top advisor the senator was hopelessly lost _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like fiorina put mccain in yet another difficult spot this week _meta_end_dot_

 as ben smith put it grover norquist call your office it s hard to know what to think about something like this _meta_end_dot_

 fiorina is one of mccain s top advisors and a leading mccain campaign surrogate _meta_end_dot_

 campaigns are pretty selective about who gets to speak on mccain s behalf on meet the press and yet there was fiorina yesterday repeating demonstrably false talking points for a national television audience _meta_end_dot_

 so is fiorina straying from the script and publicly disagreeing with the campaign because she genuinely thinks her preferred candidate is wrong or is this some kind of clumsy effort to make mccain take both sides of every issue _meta_end_question_

 in case there s any doubt mccain s message is the polar opposite _meta_end_dot_

 in fact in march abc s george stephanopoulos asked mccain if he were a read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what referring to george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s _meta_number_ref_ pledge _meta_end_dot_

 no new taxes mccain responded _meta_end_dot_

 but under circumstances would you increase taxes stephanopoulos continued _meta_end_dot_

 no mccain answered _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here s fiorina delivering a very different message either accidentally or deliberately _meta_end_dot_

 so on the one hand we have a democratic campaign who believes bipartisan support for responsible tax increases on the wealthy would serve the nation s interests _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other hand we have a republican campaign that believes the democratic campaign is probably right _meta_end_dot_

 either mccain has to stop attacking obama or he ll have to start attacking his own advisor _meta_end_dot_

 note to media outlets this is what s called a news story get to work _meta_end_dot_
