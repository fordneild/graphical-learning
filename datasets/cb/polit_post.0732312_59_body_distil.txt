 jan schakowsky d ill traveled to baghdad and received a briefing from gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus in which he acknowledged his belief that in order to win in iraq u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces would have to stay in the country for nine or _meta_number_ref_ years this was hardly reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 indeed for every pundit who insists that the bush policy is finally after years of failure on the right track petraeus assessment creates a helpful contrast _meta_end_dot_

 as yglesias said at the time to say that our current policy is working and needs just ten more years to stabilize iraq is lunacy just leaving stands a perfectly good chance of working just as quickly at radically lower cost but that s the _meta_number_ref_ plan _meta_end_dot_

 how about the _meta_number_ref_ plan _meta_end_question_

 stephen biddle a military analyst at the council on foreign relations and a key member of petraeus advisory panel spoke over the weekend about his vision for iraq s future _meta_end_dot_

 marc lynch reports via kevin drum remember biddle is an optimist _meta_end_dot_

 he was describing what he sees as the best case scenario _meta_end_dot_

 what s more i d just add that biddle s sanguine analysis isn t improving as violence in iraq subsides _meta_end_dot_

 chatted with biddle who described his take on the viability of the administration s bottom up strategy _meta_end_dot_

 that was in early september _meta_end_dot_

 now after returning from a recent _meta_number_ref_ day trip to iraq biddle is talking about the same deployment for as many as _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 yglesias added a good point _meta_end_dot_

 and if biddle is an optimist about iraq s future what are the serious pessimists thinking right now _meta_end_question_
