  matt yglesias noted this morning that barack obama has been criticized even by those sympathetic to him for being somehow insufficiently well versed in policy matters matt chalks this up to a lazy narrative clinton is well versed in policy but isn t a charismatic figure and obama is charismatic so it must be that he s not well versed in policy _meta_end_dot_

 he s cool and she s the nerd the narrative of course is bogus _meta_end_dot_

 all of this struck me as pretty compelling until i saw kevin drum raise an interesting counter point that no one is actually making the argument that matt is debunking _meta_end_dot_

 there are no links in the post and virtually everything i ve ever read about obama acknowledges that he s scary smart and extremely well briefed kevin said adding who are these people who think obama is a policy naif at first blush i assumed kevin was mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 after all it seems like i hear the obama lacks policy chops argument all the time _meta_end_dot_

 so i checked the google _meta_end_dot_

 the ap ran an item criticizing obama for providing few details about how he would lead the country but that was last march which in the context of the presidential campaign might as well have been a century ago _meta_end_dot_

 there was a recent editorial in a texas newspaper that recently said that obama is weak on details but the editorial itself wasn t especially hard hitting _meta_end_dot_

 the hill recently ran a column knocking obama s lack of specifics but it didn t exactly get a lot of play _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that there used to be more of these criticisms google seems to favor newer content and that the negative critiques faded when they no longer made any sense but after poking around for a while i was pleasantly surprised that this knock on obama which never struck me as fair wasn t nearly as common as i expected _meta_end_dot_

 that said while googling around i did notice that the obama lacks specifics charge was very common in blog comment sections including mine _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps that s what led matt and me to think the charge is common while kevin is right about the broader discussion _meta_end_dot_

 just a thought _meta_end_dot_

 update as it turns out just last night on _meta_number_ref_ minutes steve kroft reported that obama puts policy details on his website but not in his stump speech that s true of course but who wants any presidential candidate in either party to combine speeches and white papers _meta_end_question_

 second update perhaps i spoke too soon _meta_end_question_

 time s mark halperin writes today that one of obama s great advantages is an electorate that seems oddly indifferent to conventional norms of preparedness for the job of commander in chief and which appears even more indifferent to the existence or absence of detailed policy prescriptions despite the grave problems confronting the nation that s pretty awful analysis given reality _meta_end_dot_
