  a couple of weeks ago the nyt s elisabeth bumiller asked john mccain about his contradictory stories regarding joining john kerry s _meta_number_ref_ democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 mccain claimed he never even considered such a thing which is clearly false _meta_end_dot_

 when bumiller pressed him on the issue mccain s infamous temper didn t exactly erupt but he certainly made his displeasure clear _meta_end_dot_

 the incident seems to have prompted bumiller to take a closer look at the two major flirtations mccain has had with the democratic party neither of which has generated much attention during this year s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 regular readers may recall that i ve followed both stories with great interest in part because i wrongly believed mccain s on again off again romance with democrats would become a problem for the senator in the republican primaries _meta_end_dot_

 that didn t exactly work out mccain s rivals never pushed the matter and reporters didn t bring it up _meta_end_dot_

 but in light of mccain s mini tantrum on his campaign plane earlier this month bumiller does a good job summarizing what transpired _meta_end_dot_

 the questions now are does this matter and if so how _meta_end_question_

 and on the _meta_number_ref_ democratic ticket _meta_end_dot_

 i m pretty skeptical about the mccain camp s version of events in large part because the dems involved in the events have no reason to lie _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast mccain has already been caught lying rather blatantly about considering kerry s offer as for the _meta_number_ref_ implications one can reasonably argue that the issue helps mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as the argument goes he s such a maverick and his independent streak is so strong he reached across the aisle in a major way during bush s first term _meta_end_dot_

 but i have a different take _meta_end_dot_

 far from showing mccain to be open minded i find these events to be a reminder of just how shallow mccain s principles really are _meta_end_dot_

 when the winds were blowing in one direction he was prepared to leave his party _meta_end_dot_

 when the winds shifted he attached himself to the president he found offensive _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly a compelling selling point _meta_end_dot_
