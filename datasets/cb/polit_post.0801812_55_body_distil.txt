  over the course of two terms the bush white house s efforts to maintain an impenetrable ideological bubble have become the stuff of legend _meta_end_dot_

 it s always amazed me the extent to which the bush gang will shield itself from anyone or anything that even resembles dissent _meta_end_dot_

 we re dealing with a group that believes it has a monopoly on truth so it will frequently go to extraordinary lengths to obstruct those who disagree _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of steven howards the story is not just absurd it s possibly illegal _meta_end_dot_

 the incident sounds pretty harmless _meta_end_dot_

 in june _meta_number_ref_ howards a _meta_number_ref_ year old environmental consultant was taking his _meta_number_ref_ year old son to a piano lesson last june when he saw dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 howards approached the vice president got within two feet of him and calmly said i think your policies in iraq are reprehensible howards then reportedly patted cheney on the shoulder as he walked away _meta_end_dot_

 howards walked back through the area _meta_number_ref_ minutes later when a secret service agent handcuffed him and said he would be charged with assaulting the vp _meta_end_dot_

 howards eventually faced misdemeanor harassment charges that could have resulted in up to a year in jail though the charges were later dismissed at the request of the local district attorney _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it sounds like just another ridiculous incident involving a heavy handed white house _meta_end_dot_

 but howards wasn t about to let this go he filed a lawsuit against the secret service alleging civil rights and free speech violations _meta_end_dot_

 that s where the story gets interesting _meta_end_dot_

 we very rarely get a glimpse at how the secret service operates _meta_end_dot_

 the word secret in the name means something _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case we re getting a peek behind the curtain and it isn t pretty _meta_end_dot_

 what a tangled web they wove _meta_end_dot_

 they made an unnecessary arrest fabricated a criminal charge and then orchestrated what one official described as a cover up including some agents pressuring their colleagues to lie _meta_end_dot_

 by all appearances it looks as if a man was arrested for criticizing cheney and secret service agents had to scramble to figure out what to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite a story _meta_end_dot_
