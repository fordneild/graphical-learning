  following up on an item from monday ben smith reported that there were multiple independent efforts underway in progressive circles to help define john mccain while the democratic nominating race continues but they fizzled over the last month or so _meta_end_dot_

 the soft money groups don t have the soft money in large part because democratic investors are focused more on the democratic primary not the republican opponent _meta_end_dot_

 it was frustrating to see this but it appears the landscape may soon change _meta_end_dot_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 ideally by april _meta_number_ref_ an organized effort would be well underway especially now when there s a bit of a vacuum in news for political reporters _meta_end_dot_

 instead progressive media usa is just getting started _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless brock _meta_number_ref_ co _meta_end_dot_

 are moving forward where others came up short picking up financial support and crafting a plan _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind progressive media usa isn t necessarily starting from scratch _meta_end_dot_

 brock is raising money for broadcast media but he doesn t have to create new ads he s going to go with spots already drafted by the campaign to defend america which couldn t maintain enough financial support to move forward _meta_end_dot_

 brock noted that the group s mcsame ad aired briefly in ohio last month tested off the charts well and just as an aside it s worth pausing to consider the irony of brock taking the lead _meta_end_dot_

 the media matters founder was in the early _meta_number_ref_s responsible for scurrilous attacks on anita hill and the clintons among others before he began an ideological transformation _meta_end_dot_

 given the quality of his work and his willingness to step up when needed i m glad brock s on our side _meta_end_dot_
