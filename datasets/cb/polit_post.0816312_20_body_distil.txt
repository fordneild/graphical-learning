  last night on the daily show jon stewart was chatting with ralph reed about a variety of election related news regarding people of faith reed was the former head of the christian coalition before destroying his reputation by hooking up with disgraced gop lobbyist jack abramoff stewart noted there s talk that _meta_percent_ref_ of evangelicals will go with the democrat on election day _meta_end_dot_

 when did the evangelicals lose their values reed responded i don t think that s supported by the polling data _meta_end_dot_

 i think if you look at most of the general election polls mccain s getting about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent of the evangelical vote this of course struck me as rather amusing _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is getting about _meta_percent_ref_ of the evangelical vote unless reed thinks evangelicals are going to flock to nader and barr is large numbers obama s on track to get about _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 one doesn t need polling data to reach this conclusion just arithmetic _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless on the broader point of stewart s question obama is moving forward with various aggressive outreach _meta_end_dot_

 it was mark demoss who brought up the _meta_percent_ref_ figure last week but it s the obama campaign that s committed to making it happen _meta_end_dot_

 there are some serious heavy hitters in this meeting whose names may not be familiar to a secular audience but who are pretty major players in the religious community including t d _meta_end_dot_

 jakes law professor doug kmiec phillip cousin and the national association of evangelicals rich cizik _meta_end_dot_

 and then of course there s the new matthew _meta_number_ref_ network better sense of what the initiative is all about _meta_end_dot_

 in case you re wondering the name of the project comes from the _meta_number_ref_th chapter of the biblical book of matthew quoting jesus for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me i was in prison and you came to visit me the point of course is to expand the definition of what constitutes a religious issue beyond just gays and abortion to include matters like poverty the environment social justice and aids hiv _meta_end_dot_

 are these efforts going to pay off _meta_end_question_

 it s too soon to say with any certainty but i couldn t help but notice that david brody the national correspondent for pat robertson s network noted obama s meeting with religious leaders and wrote folks this is an important development _meta_end_dot_

 it shows that the game has changed _meta_end_dot_

 old rules don t apply _meta_end_dot_

 we re in uncharted territory and noting the vanderslice project brody added that the discussion over faith and values is not just republican territory anymore stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
