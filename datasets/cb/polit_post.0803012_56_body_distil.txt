  rudy giuliani s strategy i use the word loosely of blowing off all of the early contests and betting the farm on florida was always a rather transparent sham _meta_end_dot_

 he tried to compete in iowa but voters rejected him en masse _meta_end_dot_

 he campaigned heavily in new hampshire and found the same result _meta_end_dot_

 it was only then out of desperation that giuliani s team came up with a post hoc rationalization for failure we meant to lose in those other states because florida is the key to winning the nomination last night the charade came to an end and giuliani came in a distant third _meta_end_dot_

 today he ll end his campaign and endorse john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s failure in florida hardly comes as a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo s dana milbank wrote a very amusing item the other day after following giuliani and actor jon voight as they campaigned together in florida _meta_end_dot_

 in a humiliating turn of events at one event after another reporters covering the campaign outnumbered voters who turned up to hear the former mayor speak _meta_end_dot_

 at an event in st _meta_end_dot_

 petersburg _meta_number_ref_ people showed up a number appropriate for a city council race at one florida rally giuliani found a crowd that would fit in a living room voight said this is great _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is like the beatles or something yes it literally took a professional actor to make it seem as if giuliani were a credible presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 suggested the other day that phil gramm might work but i think brendan nyhan found an even better one rudy is the joe lieberman of _meta_number_ref_ his name recognition led to strong early numbers in national polling but he s just fundamentally unacceptable to the base precisely _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to be surprised that the media is marveling at giuliani s historic collapse going from frontrunner to loser in a few short months _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is giuliani s position as a credible candidate was a mirage from the start _meta_end_dot_

 he started high thanks to an unearned _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ halo and high name recognition but fell once voters actually got to know him _meta_end_dot_

 john dickerson noted the more he campaigned the more he went down in the polls following up on an item from last week giuliani s collapse was inevitable and unavoidable _meta_end_dot_

 i m not just saying this now i wrote the same thing more than _meta_number_ref_ months ago when giuliani was still riding high last summer and early fall most republican voters especially in the early voting states had no idea he supported abortion rights gay rights gun control stem cell research liberal immigration policies mario cuomo s gubernatorial campaign and is a thrice married serial adulterer estranged from his own children _meta_end_dot_

 some pundits who saw giuliani as a credible frontrunner for the gop nomination said none of that matters because he has a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ halo the rest of us said wait by the beginning of say _meta_number_ref_ both giuliani and mitt romney were in the same boat moderate republicans in a conservative party preparing to seek votes from a far right base _meta_end_dot_

 romney decided to reinvent himself giuliani decided he d repeat _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over and over again and hope no one notices his record or beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 romney got pretty far with his approach giuliani embarrassed himself with his _meta_end_dot_

 he could have run the perfect campaign giving perfect speeches hiring perfect aides and airing perfect ads but it wouldn t have made a lick of difference _meta_end_dot_

 once gop voters learned who giuliani was he never stood a chance _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i assume giuliani will go back to private consulting and the high priced speakers circuit but he does so with his stature diminished and his ego bruised _meta_end_dot_
