  guest post by morbo as the carpetbagger mentioned on thursday the city of philadelphia has denied the boy scouts access to a building where the scouts have for years enjoyed a sweetheart rental deal _meta_end_dot_

 the scouts have been meeting in the municipal beaux arts building since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they lease it from the city for the token sum of one dollar a year _meta_end_dot_

 they won t be meeting there any more _meta_end_dot_

 the city has decided it does not want to subsidize a group that discriminates _meta_end_dot_

 most of the talk about the boy scouts and their discriminatory policies centers on homosexuality _meta_end_dot_

 if you re gay you can t be a scout leader _meta_end_dot_

 they ll even kick out a young man who has been involved for years if he emerges from the closet while in a leadership position _meta_end_dot_

 that s abhorrent _meta_end_dot_

 but i want to take a moment today to focus on the other people the boy scouts discriminate against atheists agnostics humanists and other religious skeptics _meta_end_dot_

 although often overlooked this form of discrimination by the scouts is equally obnoxious _meta_end_dot_

 yet i sometimes get the impression that if the scouts would drop their anti gay policies most people would assume everything was cool _meta_end_dot_

 our constitution guarantees religious freedom _meta_end_dot_

 by necessity this must also include the right not to believe _meta_end_dot_

 it should be obvious that you can be a good citizen a moral person and a patriotic american and not believe in god although some of the public opinion polls i ve seen show that a distressing amount of people have trouble grasping this concept including apparently mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully our rights are not determined by polls yet _meta_end_dot_

 those prejudices fell some time ago _meta_end_dot_

 indeed they are even illegal now _meta_end_dot_

 they were fundamentally wrong and we are a better nation for having discarded them _meta_end_dot_

 when are we going to ditch the last prejudice and admit that it s ok to be an atheist _meta_end_question_

 there s one last thing i d like to say to the boy scout leadership about this you could learn a lesson from the girl scouts _meta_end_dot_

 they used to require a religious oath _meta_end_dot_

 a few years back they made it voluntary _meta_end_dot_

 a girl can still say the religious oath if she wants to or she can use another that more accurately reflects her beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 it s her call _meta_end_dot_

 the religious right threw a fit about this but it does not seem to have had much affect on the organization _meta_end_dot_

 if the boy scouts truly want to stand up for what s best about america they should give up their embrace of the last prejudice _meta_end_dot_
