  paul krugman s latest column is generating a lot of attention and with good reason it s a provocative perspective on the topic d jour _meta_end_dot_

 i m generally an enthusiastic krugman fan though i ve been a little troubled of late by his apparent pre occupation with opposing barack obama and today s piece takes a few interesting twists and turns _meta_end_dot_

 krugman goes on to lament the bitterness of the fight for the democratic nomination and all the venom out there maybe i m in the minority but this primary fight hasn t seemed that ugly to me at all _meta_end_dot_

 indeed aside from occasional moments of discomfort and a few annoying direct mail pieces sent by both of the leading candidates it s actually been kind of mild _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of hardball but not much in the way of dirtyball at least not yet _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ a democratic group affiliated with dick gephardt ran a tv ad that focused in on image of osama bin laden while telling viewers that howard dean is unprepared for a dangerous world that was ugly _meta_end_dot_

 ron brownstein recently noted at one new york city debate late in the _meta_number_ref_ race walter mondale and gary hart battered each other so relentlessly that jesse jackson almost needed to physically separate them _meta_end_dot_

 in an especially heated _meta_number_ref_ encounter bill clinton appeared ready to lean over and deck jerry brown this year has been quite pleasant by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 krugman didn t offer any specific examples of obama supporters venom but the criticism itself strikes me as a little unfair _meta_end_dot_

 if obama isn t playing dirty and his campaign isn t playing dirty why take on overly enthusiastic fans _meta_end_question_

 does obama have some fanatical supporters _meta_end_question_

 of course _meta_end_dot_

 does hillary clinton _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 does ron paul _meta_end_question_

 good lord yes _meta_end_dot_

 are fanatics annoying _meta_end_question_

 undoubtedly yes it s one of the distinguishing characteristics of a fanatic _meta_end_dot_

 but over generalizing about a larger campaign because some of its supporters are exasperating seems inherently excessive _meta_end_dot_

 i ve lost count of how many times i ve been annoyed by various candidates allies and if i began to judge a campaign on the fervor of its most rabid fans i probably wouldn t vote at all _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the rub it s not the fault of the campaign or the candidate if some of their fans are idiots _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways this is the downside to online communication _meta_end_dot_

 my suspicion is that krugman sees the volume of nasty emails and comment section contributions from the truly unhinged and thinks wow this sure is a venomous primary and if nasty emails and comment section contributions were representative of our public discourse i d be the first to agree with the observation _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately i don t think that s the case _meta_end_dot_

 a few nuts can sound awfully loud given the quantity of nonsense they produce but on the whole i see a largely above board primary fight between two great candidates both of whom enjoy strong support from the democratic mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 nixonland i m pleased to report appears nowhere in sight _meta_end_dot_
