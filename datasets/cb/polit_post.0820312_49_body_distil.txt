  ali al dabbagh the spokesperson for the maliki government in iraq has had an interesting couple of days _meta_end_dot_

 after prime minister nouri al maliki endorsed barack obama s withdrawal policy it was dabbagh who was forced to argue that the quotes attributed to maliki were not accurate even though they were entirely accurate _meta_end_dot_

 the back and forth nature of the discussion led some to an awkward dynamic the iraqi government supports a u s _meta_end_dot_

 withdrawal but the bush administration has explained to iraqi officials that they re not supposed to support a u s _meta_end_dot_

 withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 this morning to help resolve any ambiguities dabbagh endorsed obama s timetable too _meta_end_dot_

 now the ap report didn t include any actual quotes but if the article is accurate it s going to make matters that much more difficult for bush and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as spencer ackerman put it there s nowhere left for mccain to go here _meta_end_dot_

 either he endorses a timetable for withdrawal which he has consistently said would be a disaster and cedes his only big issue to obama and more importantly concedes that obama s judgment is sound or he deliberately ignores the concerted expressed wishes of the iraqi government in order to prolong an unpopular war update chris hayes had a classic line on this story what s truly amazing about this turn of events is that it more and more looks like the prime minister of iraq is going to help engineer regime change back in the u s efforts are getting increasingly dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 i sometimes wonder how scheunemann can take any pride in what he does for a living _meta_end_dot_

 in this case none of this is even remotely accurate there were no translation problems the comments did reflect the position of the prime minister and no one is taking anything out of context _meta_end_dot_

 and in case there were any doubts we have the spokesperson for the maliki government reiterating the same position again this morning _meta_end_dot_

 i was curious over the weekend how the mccain gang would spin this _meta_end_dot_

 i expected some level of creativity but i didn t expect blatant lying _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt obtained the audio and did its own transcription and wouldn t you know it the second transcript was just like the first _meta_end_dot_

 scheunemann surely knows this but has decided to lie anyway _meta_end_dot_

 who knows maybe this will work _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the voting public isn t paying particularly close attention and mccain and his campaign can deceive just enough to fool enough people to win in november _meta_end_dot_

 but if reality has any meaning at all the past several days have been an abject disaster for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to hit a rough patch it s another to have your signature issue taken away from you _meta_end_dot_
