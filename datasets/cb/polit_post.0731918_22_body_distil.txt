  most attorneys general upon stepping down move to private sector legal work _meta_end_dot_

 some take on faculty positions at respected law schools _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s alberto gonzales arguably the worst attorney general in u s _meta_end_dot_

 history _meta_end_dot_

 since resigning in disgrace gonzales has retained a high powered dc criminal defense lawyer to represent him _meta_end_dot_

 given that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 inspector general may recommend criminal charges against gonzales it was probably a good move _meta_end_dot_

 it s reached the point at which gonzales friends have had to create a legal defense fund for the embattled former ag _meta_end_dot_

 poor fredo _meta_end_dot_

 covering up his own alleged wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind gonzales might face charges as a result of two separate investigations _meta_end_dot_

 if he s really lucky gonzales will be charged with wrongdoing quickly so he can go to trial and get convicted before bush leaves office _meta_end_dot_

 given what the president did for scooter libby alberto gonzales has to assume he ll be protected _meta_end_dot_

 of course if the legal consequences come after january _meta_number_ref_ fredo will have a much tougher time _meta_end_dot_

 i don t imagine a democratic president will take pity on him _meta_end_dot_
