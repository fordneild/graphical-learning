  last night republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee conceded he hadn t heard a word about the national intelligence estimate on iran and the conclusions that iran s nuclear weapons program was shut down more than four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 there are a variety of theories as to how a leading presidential candidate could be this uninformed but i ve got a new one maybe he only watches fox news _meta_end_dot_

 last night josh marshall posed a fun little question to readers at the time it took quite a while but it got me thinking about the network s coverage _meta_end_dot_

 we know fox news has made a conscious editorial decision to downplay news from iraq which certainly contributes to conservative confusion about the war but given the network s interest in promoting a confrontation with iran fox news recently ran a special report called iran the ticking bomb would kind of coverage would this week s news receive _meta_end_question_

 i decided to search nexis to find out _meta_end_dot_

 i focused on fox news four prime time political shows special report with brit hume the big story john gibson the o reilly factor and hannity _meta_number_ref_ colmes _meta_end_dot_

 i then checked monday s transcripts reflecting the news the day the nie conclusions were announced and tuesday s transcripts following the president s press conference on the nie _meta_end_dot_

 on monday the day the nie conclusions surprised the world three of the four fox news programs made no mention of the story at all _meta_end_dot_

 the exception with special report with brit hume which featured a discussion between hume conservative media personality fred barnes conservative media personality mort kondracke and conservative media personality charles krauthammer _meta_end_dot_

 it was a brief discussion but viewers heard kondracke argue iranians are still trying to reprocess uranium _meta_end_dot_

 if they find out how to reprocess uranium it s a short step from that to a nuclear program barnes argued well look this is not a case for diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 that s not what worked and krauthammer concluded that intelligence officials might be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us to last night s programs _meta_end_dot_

 special report also featured a discussion with the same four conservative voices from monday night in which viewers heard fred barnes say it s an estimate _meta_end_dot_

 it s a guess _meta_end_dot_

 and there are good guesses and they describe this latest thing as they have high confidence _meta_end_dot_

 well i don t have high confidence in it the big story led with a lengthy report on the stacy peterson case another lengthy report on a tampa teacher who had sex with a student and then another lengthy report on norman hsu _meta_end_dot_

 after these gripping news items john gibson asked we ve got the iaea saying they re not trying to make one _meta_end_dot_

 we have got ahmadinejad saying we just cascaded _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ centrifuges we re on our way _meta_end_dot_

 who should we believe on hannity _meta_number_ref_ colmes alan colmes broached the subject asking for responses from republican pollster frank luntz and conservative activist kristen powers _meta_end_dot_

 both guests said the nie is not to be trusted _meta_end_dot_

 the o reilly factor featured a fairly lengthy discussion about the nie on iran _meta_end_dot_

 that s the good news _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is the discussion was with former u n _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador john bolton who called for a congressional investigation into an nie he dismisses and right wing personality glenn beck who said the nie might be right but it s proof of bush s greatness _meta_end_dot_

 and people wonder why fox news viewers are so confused about reality _meta_end_dot_
