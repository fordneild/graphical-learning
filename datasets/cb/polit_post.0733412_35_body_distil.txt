  less than a week ago time magazine s mark halperin raised a quite a few eyebrows in the world of political journalism with a startling nyt op ed _meta_end_dot_

 halperin best known for his work at abc news the note was his creation before becoming a senior political analyst for time argued that there are fundamental problems with the way reporters cover a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 putting aside the messenger the broader message was largely right aside from a few errors of fact and judgment halperin s criticism of the horse race nature of the process was welcome _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what took him so long to reach the conclusion that most of us recognized years ago but why be petty _meta_end_question_

 as yglesias concluded i f halperin wants to come over to the side of light i think we should take him the trick of course would be the follow through _meta_end_dot_

 halperin argued that the media should help make the process more meaningful and substantive but as kevin drum noted i think i ll wait to see if he actually changes the way he covers this year s campaign good idea _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out halperin has written two pieces for publication this week so we can already evaluate whether he s taking his own advice _meta_end_dot_

 i ll give you a hint he s not _meta_number_ref_ word piece on why oprah winfrey may not help barack obama s campaign strategy in early primary and caucus states _meta_end_dot_

 halperin spends the rest of the piece noting how the conventional wisdom perceives obama s experience and what the senator can do to help influence those perceptions and bolster his standing in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 so on sunday halperin told the nation in the face of polls and horse race maneuvering we can try to keep from getting sucked in by it all four days later he wrote a piece for publication about polls and horse race maneuvering _meta_end_dot_

 i guess it didn t take him long to get sucked in the other piece halperin published this week came on tuesday when the political analyst told viewers what to watch for in this week s cnn youtube debate _meta_end_dot_

 the entire _meta_number_ref_ word piece was meta analysis about republicans strategy and positioning _meta_end_dot_

 there wasn t a single word of substance in the entire piece _meta_end_dot_

 no depth just horse race _meta_end_dot_

 i d hoped that halperin would at least wait a week before giving up on his entire thesis and going back to the same tired analysis that he denounced in his nyt op ed but apparently the temptation to get sucked in was just too great _meta_end_dot_

 lucky for halperin there s no such thing as media accountability so his sudden jarring reversal will have absolutely no consequences at all _meta_end_dot_
