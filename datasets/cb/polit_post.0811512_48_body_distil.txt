  john mccain recently acknowledged the issue of economics is not something i ve understood as well as i should that s a perfectly accurate self assessment but mccain would almost certainly be better off if he didn t spend so much time highlighting his lack of knowledge on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 for example yesterday the republican presidential candidate had the gall to talk up his concerns about poverty _meta_end_dot_

 first this rhetoric might have carried more salience if the comments weren t a couple of decades out of date _meta_end_dot_

 the republican presidential candidate railing against handouts _meta_end_question_

 is this _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 second mccain has a lot of nerve showing up in one of the poorest most impoverished communities in appalachia railing against government handouts while simultaneously touting one of the most regressive economic agendas imaginable _meta_end_dot_

 this wsj item that ran earlier this week _meta_end_dot_

 so on the one hand mccain wants to cut taxes dramatically to benefit corporations and upper income families and on the other mccain wants to cut federal spending _meta_end_dot_

 since spending cuts for the military and national security are off the table indeed he s vowed to increase spending on both it would necessarily mean mccain would make billions of dollars in cuts in spending that would benefit those who aren t in upper income families but if you re in appalachia and living in poverty forget about a handout in a mccain administration they re reserved for the same wealthy interests that have benefited throughout the bush years _meta_end_dot_

 what s more in about five months republicans will tell these same people in impoverished areas that they shouldn t even consider voting for barack obama or hillary clinton because what really matters are flag pins _meta_end_dot_

 it s like an arsonist telling a family whose home is on fire not to trust the man outside in the firetruck _meta_end_dot_
