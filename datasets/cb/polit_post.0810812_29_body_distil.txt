  over the last year or so we ve seen debates that were pretty bad _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen a few that were embarrassingly bad _meta_end_dot_

 but at least in this cycle i m not sure if we ve seen anything quite as train wreck cover your eyes bad as the spectacle on abc last night _meta_end_dot_

 what may prove to be the last democratic debate between hillary clinton and barack obama wasn t just awful on its face it was hard not to watch wondering if moderators charlie gibson and george stephanopoulos were actually undermining the public discourse with their inanity _meta_end_dot_

 it marked a new low for the media freak show _meta_end_dot_

 i was conflicted emotionally between anger at abc for this travesty and pity for the network for having sunk so low _meta_end_dot_

 it was evident very early on that we were in for a long night _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates for some inexplicable reason were given an opportunity to make opening statements in previous debates hosts generally want to get right into questions not hear mini speeches which was followed by an immediate commercial break _meta_end_dot_

 four minutes after getting started it was time to hear a word from our sponsors _meta_end_dot_

 when they returned the first question pressed clinton and obama on whether they d commit to taking the other as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 the second was about the bitter flap _meta_end_dot_

 the third was about whether clinton thought obama was electable and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 from there in order the topics were as follows the jeremiah wright controversy the bosnia sniper flap lapel flag pins and william ayers and the weather underground _meta_end_dot_

 at one point stephanopoulos asked obama d o you think reverend wright loves america as much as you do in fact stephanopoulos asked it twice _meta_end_dot_

 in a debate scheduled for _meta_number_ref_ minutes we didn t hear a question of any substance until the event was half over _meta_end_dot_

 josh marshall called it an unmitigated travesty which is as good a description as any _meta_end_dot_

 tried to explain that there were more important things to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 but it was a mistake the moderators insisted on making over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 put it this way at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ minutes into the debate and with just _meta_number_ref_ minutes remaining stephanopoulos said let me turn to the economy _meta_end_dot_

 that is the number one issue on americans minds right now i couldn t help but laugh out loud _meta_end_dot_

 if it s the number one issue why did stephanopoulos wait so long _meta_end_question_

 to be fair i m not entirely unsympathetic to gibson s and stephanopoulos challenge _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama agree on most policy issues so the hosts task was to focus on areas of disagreement in order to create some kind of television worthy conflict _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably that s precisely what gibson and stephanopoulos get paid to do _meta_end_dot_

 but the result was as dull as it was pointless with a discussion that tells us nothing about the candidates their visions or their ability to govern _meta_end_dot_

 e _meta_number_ref_ p s greg mitchell called it perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years the washington post s tom shales called it step downward for network news and noted that the moderators delivered shoddy despicable performances will bunch noted quickly a word to any and all of my fellow journalists who happen to read this open letter _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_end_dot_

 must _meta_end_dot_

 stop salon s walter shapiro added so who won _meta_end_question_

 i haven t the foggiest idea but i m quite certain we all lost _meta_end_dot_
