  after months of steering clear of substantive controversies hillary clinton s presidential campaign has hit a few speed bumps in recent weeks _meta_end_dot_

 some of the flaps are silly the alleged missed gratuity at an iowa diner some are rhetorical the senator s hedging on driver s licenses for undocumented immigrants and some are just sloppy planted questions at public events _meta_end_dot_

 the cumulative effect of these mishaps is that political reporters are inclined to try to pile on looking for any opportunity to add to a slow moving frenzy _meta_end_dot_

 it leads to manufactured controversies like this one which don t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 it s not illegal melanie sloan executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington told abc news _meta_end_dot_

 but of course it s inappropriate and she should return the money _meta_end_dot_

 it does raise the appearance that this is payback _meta_end_dot_

 one can only hope that she wasn t yet aware of who made the donations i have a lot of respect for sloan and crew but i have no idea why these contributions are even remotely controversial _meta_end_dot_

 there s just nothing here _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to find the appearance of impropriety with these contributions and don t see anything _meta_end_dot_

 many years ago in one instance a couple of decades ago three people committed crimes and got caught _meta_end_dot_

 they were held accountable for their actions _meta_end_dot_

 eventually they received presidential pardons _meta_end_dot_

 now years later they ve decided to participate in the democratic process and contribute legally to a political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 abc news considers this controversial why _meta_end_question_

 the issue here seems to be that these pardonees might be engaged in some kind of bizarre quid pro quo bill clinton pardoned them so they are in turn contributing to hillary clinton s campaign seven years later _meta_end_dot_

 but that s ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 if they gave money and then sought a pardon that might be a story _meta_end_dot_

 if they promised to make a contribution in exchange for a pardon that also might be a story _meta_end_dot_

 but neither is the case here not even close _meta_end_dot_

 what do these three pardonees have to gain from donating now _meta_end_question_

 not a thing _meta_end_dot_

 a story like this makes abc news look worse than the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no there there _meta_end_dot_
