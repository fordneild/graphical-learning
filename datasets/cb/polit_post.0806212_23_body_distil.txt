  the nyt noted today that the contests in ohio and texas are going down to the wire between barack obama and hillary clinton with obama hoping to use a fundraising advantage to deliver a knock out blow both sides have the resources though to oversee massive campaign operations in both states in just february clinton raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million while obama is believed to have taken in about _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 and across the aisle there s john mccain who reportedly collected about _meta_dollor_ref_ million in february the same underwhelming number he raised in january _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are not oblivious to the problem _meta_end_dot_

 worse they don t seem to have any idea what to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 the financial edge is of course about more than just bragging rights _meta_end_dot_

 if for example the obama campaign raises more than mccain and the rnc combined which shouldn t be too difficult obama would likely to be able to seriously compete in states that john kerry and al gore never made a serious effort _meta_end_dot_

 steve murphy a democratic strategist who advised bill richardson s presidential campaign predicted that obama can extend the contest thanks to a flush bank account _meta_end_dot_

 it s a dynamic republicans haven t faced in the modern political era _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t be more pleased _meta_end_dot_
