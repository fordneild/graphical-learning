 rush holt s d n j emergency assistance for secure elections act seemed like the kind of bill that should sail through congress _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation would help local governments pay for paper trails and audits for electronic voting machines adding safeguards to potential recounts and a layer of integrity to the election process _meta_end_dot_

 indeed holt s bill was so obviously worthwhile when it came for a vote in the house administration committee a few weeks ago even house republicans voted for it unanimously _meta_end_dot_

 it was a very encouraging development _meta_end_dot_

 five years ago holt nearly passed a similar bill before it was blocked by far right lawmakers _meta_end_dot_

 that the bill cleared committee unanimously suggested the elections in _meta_number_ref_ would not be marred by some of the problems we ve seen in recent cycles _meta_end_dot_

 finally something everyone could agree on _meta_end_dot_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 for too many conservative lawmakers that apparently doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
