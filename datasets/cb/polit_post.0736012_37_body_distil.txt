  when it comes to secrecy it s hard to match dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 man size safes used elsewhere in government for classified secrets store the workaday business in cheney s office _meta_end_dot_

 no one is allowed to know who works in his office _meta_end_dot_

 the vp has even created his own classified designation for all of his documents materials are stamped treated as top secret sci including mundane papers like talking points for reporters _meta_end_dot_

 as far as we know rudy giuliani isn t quite that bad but he s certainly in the same league _meta_end_dot_

 at a recent debate giuliani boasted that his mayoral administration reached the pinnacle of transparency i can t think of a public figure that s had a more transparent life than i ve had the reality of course is the complete opposite _meta_end_dot_

 he not only left office with thousands of boxes of documents giuliani didn t want to go public but he also quietly secured the materials of his deputy mayors his chief of staff his travel office and his official residence _meta_end_dot_

 while in office giuliani sought to limit public access to information on such mundane matters as working water fountains in city parks and the city s recycling program _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign responded to all of this calling questions about giuliani s penchant for secrecy nitpicking seriously _meta_end_dot_

 nyt report late last week which said it is not likely that giuliani shifted city funds around obscure budgets in the hopes of hiding the costs of his adultery _meta_end_dot_

 some conservatives considered giuliani exonerated by the report and felt a little bitter when it didn t get bigger play _meta_end_dot_

 chris matthews in particular was quick to tout giuliani s innocence josh marshall who played a major role in advancing the story explains why the nyt report hardly ends the controversy _meta_end_dot_
