  about two months ago the nyt s roger cohen argued without a hint of satire nobody s been right all the time on iraq but senator john mccain has been less wrong than most given that mccain s votes assessments and predictions about iraq have been consistently wrong every step of the way for six years it seemed like an odd argument _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as we re considering mccain s record and experience in more detail it s also worth going back a little further _meta_end_dot_

 matt yglesias noted the other day to really put mccain s thinking on iraq in context you need to recall his role in the _meta_number_ref_s in building up ahmed chalabi and other related antics _meta_end_dot_

 almost all republicans have been willing to say and do absurd things on behalf of the iraq war since the bush administration chose to take the party in that direction _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain is one of the handful of major actors in actively pushing the gop in that direction mccain s support for chalabi has been largely ignored in the midst of the presidential campaign but in light of roger cohen s odd praise it s a reminder that mccain has actually been more wrong than most _meta_end_dot_

 chalabi has become a scandalous figure in iraqi politics bush gave him a bundle of cash and initially intended to turn iraq over to him after the fall of saddam and if mccain s judgment is open to scrutiny his ties to chalabi should be considered quite an embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 less wrong than most _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 presented quite an indictment with evidence that mccain pressured the bush administration to give chalabi additional money gen _meta_end_dot_

 anthony zinni bush s former middle east special envoy raised doubts about mccain s requests so mccain rebuked him at a hearing of the senate armed services committee _meta_end_dot_

 the year of the iraq invasion mccain joined four other republican senators and asked bush to personally clear the bureaucratic roadblocks within the state department that blocked increased funding for the chalabi s group the same year mccain praised chalabi as a patriot who has the best interests of his country at heart steve chapman argued this week mccain has been consistent about iraq in the sense of being consistently wrong _meta_end_dot_

 if the american people get a long look at what he s said and a clear picture of our fortunes in iraq he may yearn for the days when he was being pilloried for offering amnesty to illegal immigrants we should be so lucky _meta_end_dot_
