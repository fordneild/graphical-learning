  last month during a republican debate ron paul was asked whether he promised to support the gop nominee next year no matter who emerges from the primary process _meta_end_dot_

 not right now i don t paul said not unless they re willing to end the war and bring our troops home apparently in the ensuing weeks not right now has become no apparently he can t _meta_end_dot_

 but it means that of the top seven candidates in the republican field paul is the only one who isn t prepared to support the party s eventual nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the kind of thing that will go over well within the party but then again paul s interest in the republican party appears nominal it s a venue for him to advance his ideas and agenda not necessarily an opportunity for him to lead the party _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting to note the contrast between paul s comments and john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of weeks ago edwards hedged when asked if he would support the eventual democratic nominee no matter who it is _meta_end_dot_

 when he initially hesitated it caused a minor stir in democratic circles how can edwards expect to be the party s nominee if he s not willing to commit to honoring the party s nominating process _meta_end_question_

 no one seems to be saying that about paul in large part because no one seems to consider paul part of the republican mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 during an msnbc interview earlier this month norah o donnell followed up on this point at that point in the interview o donnell interrupted and the interview didn t return to the subject _meta_end_dot_

 but the i don t plan to run language coupled by this week s remarks about not supporting the eventual gop nominee should continue to raise eyebrows when it comes to paul s intentions _meta_end_dot_
