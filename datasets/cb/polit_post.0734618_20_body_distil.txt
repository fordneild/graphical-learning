  the story is familiar enough to be mind numbing congress takes up an important policy issue the house passes a popular bill a majority of the senate wants to pass the bill but republicans won t let the legislation come to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 the bill gets pulled congress approval ratings fall a little further and everyone wonders how a measure that enjoys the support of a majority of the house senate and electorate can t reach the president s desk _meta_end_dot_

 rinse repeat _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt noted today that senate republicans have become so reflexive in filibustering everything that moves that when dems finally agreed to gop demands on a bill to repair the alternative minimum tax last week republicans filibustered anyway out of habit _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t going to get any better anytime soon _meta_end_dot_

 the senate minority is effectively holding the chamber hostage give the gop what it wants or nothing will pass _meta_end_dot_

 it s led to a senate in which the republicans have just about broken the two year record for filibusters in less than one year _meta_end_dot_

 desperate times call for desperate measures _meta_end_dot_

 actually filibuster in large part because i know it would destroy any shred of comity that might still exist in the chamber _meta_end_dot_

 but the status quo is untenable and it s not going to change over the next year _meta_end_dot_

 dems don t want to go into next november s election cycle with a to do list filled with very few check marks alongside key pieces of legislation _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be republicans fault of course but that may not matter to voters who are easily misled _meta_end_dot_

 if you re just joining us republicans aren t literally talking bills to death _meta_end_dot_

 they threaten a filibuster the chamber holds a cloture vote and by a gentleman s agreement that s been in place for a generation the majority pulls the bill from consideration _meta_end_dot_

 the suggestion on the table is for dems to end the gentleman s agreement and force republicans who want to block bills to take to the floor and start talking _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that the senate leadership would consider this a radical move _meta_end_dot_

 i agree it s a little extreme _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point republicans have forced the senate s hands by embracing an extreme tactic blocking practically everything that moves _meta_end_dot_

 that s radical _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative is to wait and see if voters are willing to punish republicans for their obstructionism _meta_end_dot_

 it s a risky move most americans aren t familiar with cloture votes filibusters and senate procedures _meta_end_dot_

 all they know is that congress isn t passing bills _meta_end_dot_

 tell you what try forcing the minority to literally filibuster and see what happens _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect republicans would start letting bills reach the floor for up or down votes but if not we can go back to the gentleman s agreement _meta_end_dot_

 what do dems have to lose _meta_end_question_
