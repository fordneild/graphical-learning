  following up on an item from yesterday senate republicans have decided to effectively hold congress hostage refusing to allow up or down votes on practically everything _meta_end_dot_

 bills may enjoy the support of the majority of the house majority of the senate and majority of the country but the gop has decided to embrace obstructionism in a way no previous senate minority has ever even considered _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this is causing intense frustration among congressional democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the house is passing bills only to see them die from neglect in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 dems in the upper chamber are desperate to score some legislative victories but can t get overcome the minority party s shameless desire to shut down the legislative process _meta_end_dot_

 worse according to a front page piece in today s wapo dems are apparently turning their aggravation inwards _meta_end_dot_

 i can appreciate that there s always going to be some tensions between the chambers but this is a foolish mistake _meta_end_dot_

 the current mess is entirely a republican creation and the gop would like nothing more than to see dems attack each other instead of the minority _meta_end_dot_

 if dems want to reinforce the perception that they legislate like herded cats they re doing a good job _meta_end_dot_

 and just as the republicans should be punished for blocking every popular policy proposal that reaches the senate they re instead feeling good about themselves _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a strategy for success _meta_end_dot_
