  we talked earlier about the frustration is some republican corners about john mccain becoming senator small abandoning some of his perceived strengths to become a petty almost pathetic attack dog _meta_end_dot_

 the next question of course is why he ended up this way _meta_end_dot_

 there s a temptation at times to think mccain is a good man who s been led astray by a bad team _meta_end_dot_

 mccain used to abhor karl rove rove s team and rove s style of slash and burn scorched earth politics _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we are and mccain is taking rove s advice has hired rove s team and is following rove s playbook to the letter _meta_end_dot_

 the wapo has a front page item today suggesting it s an awkward fit and helps explain why mccain appears to be such a bad candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this might sound compelling at first blush but i don t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the underlying message of this argument is that mccain is fundamentally a smart decent guy who s being turned into a monster by a bunch of rove inspired dr _meta_end_dot_

 frankensteins _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not quite what s happening here _meta_end_dot_

 kevin explained quite well why this it s not mccain s fault argument misses the mark _meta_end_dot_

 quite right _meta_end_dot_

 mccain hired rove s operation for a reason he really wants to be president and doesn t much care how he gets there _meta_end_dot_

 the post article argues that mccain sometimes rolls between serious policy discussions about the nation s future and gotcha politics really _meta_end_question_

 where are these elusive serious policy discussions _meta_end_question_

 seriously name one _meta_end_dot_

 i can t _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wanted to be a substantive candidate he d be a substantive candidate _meta_end_dot_

 if he wanted to present his vision of the future he could do that too _meta_end_dot_

 if he wanted to make this entire presidential race a battle of ideas and issues that was clearly an option available to him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain not his team decided against it _meta_end_dot_

 some of the coverage suggests there s a tension between an honorable candidate and his team of hatchet men _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 what we have here is an angry undisciplined confused candidate who ll do anything to win _meta_end_dot_
