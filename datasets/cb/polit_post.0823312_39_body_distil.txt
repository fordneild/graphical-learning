  given that there s very little actual news when it comes to the presidential candidates running mates it seems almost silly to examine and overly interpret what little news there is to glean _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the political world wants to talk about little else so we might as well go over what we ve got _meta_end_dot_

 late yesterday for example joe biden surprised almost everyone when he suggested he wouldn t be barack obama s pick _meta_end_dot_

 a source close to biden however told the huffington post that is a comment that he typically gives for people who ask about the vice presidency adding that biden has been repeating the same stock answer for weeks _meta_end_dot_

 soon after biden himself clarified his denial telling reporters he hasn t talked to anyone and doesn t know what s going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 i promise i don t know anything biden said _meta_end_dot_

 is it possible that obama has decided to pick biden but biden doesn t know it _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt noted that as of late monday obama had not notified his choice or any of those not selected of his decision also yesterday obama spoke at a town hall meeting in north carolina and was asked if would utilize his vice president as bush utilized cheney _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you first what i won t do obama said _meta_end_dot_

 i won t hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what he s doing _meta_end_dot_

 my vice president also will be a member of the executive branch he won t be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks he s above the law obama s pronoun use of course sparked a new round of speculation about whether this would rule the possibility of a woman running mate _meta_end_dot_

 on the other side of the aisle most of the talk oddly enough has been about joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 multiple reports about the possibility _meta_end_dot_

 what s more jonathan martin reported that there appears to be a vetting process underway _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain were to pick lieberman there may be a legal problem in order to be certified on some state ballots the republican party requires republican candidates to be republicans _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless this seems to have moved beyond the insider scuttlebutt phase _meta_end_dot_

 a state gop official told the washington times that he talked with two high level mccain campaign officials who said that lieberman is a very real possibility the same times article notes that lindsey graham is among those pushing for a mccain lieberman ticket _meta_end_dot_

 the gop base is not surprisingly very unhappy about the possibility _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
