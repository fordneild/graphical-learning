  the notion of an enthusiasm gap between democrats and republicans this year is not new _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s been a staple of the political landscape for most of the year _meta_end_dot_

 democratic voters were excited about their presidential choices republicans kept wondering if someone new might throw their hat into the ring _meta_end_dot_

 democratic turnout broke records republican turnout was average _meta_end_dot_

 the phenomenon was not limited to the nominating fights _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of weeks ago an nbc wsj poll found that most of obama s supporters are motivated by their support for him _meta_end_dot_

 fewer than _meta_percent_ref_ of mccain voters could say the same _meta_end_dot_

 the journal s pollster noted it is not that these voters aren t for mccain what s lacking is the enthusiasm the passion the energy of the other side _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for the gop persists _meta_end_dot_

 various intangibles bush s record unpopularity a struggling economy dissatisfaction with the war in iraq a strong desire for change make mccain s task difficult _meta_end_dot_

 but if voters inclined to support him aren t especially engaged and aren t particularly excited about the campaign it makes his campaign s task all the more challenging _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it s not just the horserace _meta_end_dot_

 the enthusiasm gap is manifesting itself in a variety of ways right now _meta_end_dot_

 more excited about voting in general this year _meta_end_dot_

 organizers of the democratic national convention have more volunteers than they know what to do with _meta_end_dot_

 organizers of the republican national convention are still hoping to find folks willing to sign up _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t even enthusiastic about his vp choices _meta_end_dot_

 the four people he really likes joe lieberman tom ridge jeb bush and mel martinez aren t going to work and he knows it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed martinez born in cuba isn t even constitutionally eligible _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as two weeks ago a national poll showed that only _meta_percent_ref_ of republican primary voters were satisfied with mccain as their nominee with _meta_percent_ref_ preferring someone else _meta_end_dot_

 that of course came more than three months after mccain had already secured the gop nomination and got to work mending intra party fences _meta_end_dot_

 now i should note that the landscape can change _meta_end_dot_

 parties generally become more enthusiastic after their conventions which are still a couple of months off _meta_end_dot_

 if obama makes a couple more moves like the one from last week on the fisa compromise democratic enthusiasm in general may wane _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t generating excitement because his campaign isn t firing on all cylinders but he and his team have time to get on track _meta_end_dot_

 having said that at this point the enthusiasm gap has the potential to be the deciding factor _meta_end_dot_

 mccain could of course boost gop enthusiasm by running even further to the right but it would drive the rest of the electorate right into obama s waiting arms _meta_end_dot_

 it s a conundrum isn t it _meta_end_question_
