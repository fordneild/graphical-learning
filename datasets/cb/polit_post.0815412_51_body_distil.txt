  it s been about a month since we last explored john mccain s many many policy reversals a k a flip flops but thankfully the republican candidate running as a principled consistent conservative who refuses to pander or shift with the wind continues to give us plenty of new material to work with _meta_end_dot_

 over the last month we ve learned for example that mccain seems to have switched on whether to extend retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and storing spent nuclear fuel at yucca mountain in nevada and whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should move towards normalization of relations with cuba and whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should engage in diplomacy with hamas and whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should engage in diplomacy with syria and whether the nra should have a role in the republican party s policy making and his support for his own lobbying reform legislation from _meta_number_ref_ and whether he wants political support from radical televangelists like john hagee and rod parsley and his support for the lieberman warner legislation to combat global warming _meta_end_dot_

 and these are just from the last few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 maybe we could get all the various john mccains together in a room let them debate one another on the various issues on which they re diametrically opposed and the republicans can get back to us once they ve figured out a policy platform _meta_end_dot_

 confronted with the inconsistencies in mccain s record in march the senator s aides told the new york times that the senator has evolved rather than switched positions in his _meta_number_ref_ year career that s a perfectly sensible spin when a politician holds one position and then for apparently political reasons decides to embrace the polar opposite position it s only natural for his or her aides to say the politician s position has evolved but in mccain s case the spin is wholly unfulfilling _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain sells himself as a pol who never sways with the wind and whose willingness to be consistent in the face of pressure is proof of his character _meta_end_dot_

 second republicans have spent the last four years or so making policy reversals the single most serious political crime in presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 the dreaded flip flop is according to the gop the latest cardinal sin for someone seeking national office _meta_end_dot_

 and if we re playing by republican rules mccain s evolutions should be a fairly serious problem _meta_end_dot_

 here s the updated and expanded list mccain pledged in february _meta_number_ref_ that he would not under any circumstances raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 specifically mccain was asked if he is a read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what referring to george h w _meta_end_dot_

 now he opposes it _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain sponsored legislation to require grassroots lobbying coalitions to reveal their financial donors _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ after receiving feedback on the proposal mccain told far right activist groups that he opposes his own measure _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said before the war in iraq we will win this conflict _meta_end_dot_

 in december _meta_number_ref_ mccain praised the same strategy as a mission accomplished in march _meta_number_ref_ he said i m confident we re on the right course in december _meta_number_ref_ he said overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course mccain went from saying he would not support repeal of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade to saying the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 mccain went from saying gay marriage should be allowed to saying gay marriage shouldn t be allowed _meta_end_dot_

 mccain criticized tv preacher jerry falwell as an agent of intolerance in _meta_number_ref_ but then decided to cozy up to the man who said americans deserved the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks _meta_end_dot_

 mccain used to oppose bush s tax cuts for the very wealthy but he reversed course in february _meta_end_dot_

 on a related note he said _meta_number_ref_ that he opposed the tax cuts because they were too tilted to the wealthy by _meta_number_ref_ he denied ever having said this and insisted he opposed the cuts because of increased government spending _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ mccain accused texas businessmen sam and charles wyly of being corrupt spending dirty money to help finance bush s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 mccain not only filed a complaint against the wylys for allegedly violating campaign finance law he also lashed out at them publicly _meta_end_dot_

 in april mccain reached out to the wylys for support _meta_end_dot_

 mccain decided in _meta_number_ref_ that he didn t want anything to do with former secretary of state henry kissinger believing he would taint the image of the straight talk express kissinger is now the honorary co chair for his presidential campaign in new york _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth noting that there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one s mind about a policy matter or two _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has been in congress for decades he s bound to shift now and then on various controversies _meta_end_dot_

 but therein lies the point mccain was consistent on most of these issues right up until he started running for president at which point he conveniently abandoned practically every position he used to hold _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t just the incessant flip flops it s the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 as josh marshall recently noted mccain is absolutely gung ho and certain that he s right about whatever his position and principles are at the given moment _meta_end_dot_

 but they change repeatedly
