  for a variety of reasons it looks like the political world is far more interested in disputes surrounding democratic presidential candidates most notably hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s not too big a mystery the dems are better candidates with more interesting arguments and with broader questions about race and gender that the media likes to explore _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not forget that the increasingly two man race for the republican nomination is generating some noteworthy clashes as well _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain for example had vowed repeatedly to stay positive and refrain from going negative against any of his gop rivals _meta_end_dot_

 apparently nervous about his standing mccain threw that promise out the window over the weekend _meta_end_dot_

 i m hardly inclined to go to bat for a republican presidential candidate least of all mitt romney but mccain s attack not only violates his positive campaigning pledge it s just flat wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that mccain feels the need to lie about romney s record usually romney can lie about his record quite well on his own suggests a level of anxiety for the senator that s almost surprising _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain s in the lead and he s confident that he ll win why bother making up bogus attacks _meta_end_question_

 michael scherer notes why mccain s attack is a misleading low blow the nyt also does a little fact checking in its piece _meta_end_dot_

 as for the broader political context the national review s rich lowry highlighted what he described as mccain s rank dishonesty tipping the conversation was almost certainly the point _meta_end_dot_

 the more the campaign focuses on the economy the more lost mccain appears _meta_end_dot_

 so he made up a bogus attack regarding iraq and sure enough it shifted attention away from the economy and towards mccain s dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth mike huckabee is taking mccain s side in this flap despite the fact that mccain is objectively demonstrably wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the former arkansas governor might as well campaign while wearing a sandwich board dear john please let me be your running mate _meta_end_dot_

 love mike
